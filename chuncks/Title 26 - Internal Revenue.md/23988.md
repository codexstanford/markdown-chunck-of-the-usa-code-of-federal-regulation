(C)Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(v)(D) of this section, if, during a plan year, unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid, or a plan amendment takes effect, because either the plan sponsor makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) or (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or the plan's enrolled actuary determines that the increase in the funding target attributable to the occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event or the plan amendment would not cause the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage to fall below the applicable 60 percent or 80 percent threshold (taking into account the occurrence of all previous unpredictable contingent event benefits and plan amendments to the extent not already reflected in the certified adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year (or update)), then the plan administrator may request that the plan actuary issue an updated certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage that takes into account the unpredictable contingent event benefits or plan amendments and any associated section 436 contribution.
