The tables in paragraph (e)(6) of this section include factors for yearly rates of return from 0.2 to 14 percent. Many actuarial factors not contained in the tables in paragraph (e)(6) of this section are contained in Table S in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, "Actuarial Valuations Version 3A" (2009).
