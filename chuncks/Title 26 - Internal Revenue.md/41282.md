###### ยง 1.958-2 Constructive ownership of stock.
####### Example 1.

(1)United States persons A and B own 5 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the one class of stock in foreign corporation M. Corporation M owns 60 percent of the one class of stock in foreign corporation N. Under paragraph (a)(2) of ยง 1.958-1, A and B are considered as owning 3 percent (5 percent of 60 percent) and 15 percent (25 percent of 60 percent), respectively, of the stock in N Corporation. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, M Corporation is treated as owning all the stock in N Corporation, and, under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, B is considered as owning 25 percent of such 100 percent, or 25 percent of the stock in N Corporation. Inasmuch as A owns less than 10 percent of the stock in M Corporation, he is not considered as owning, under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, any of the stock in N Corporation owned by M Corporation. Thus, the attribution rules of paragraph (a)(2) of ยง 1.958-1 are used with respect to A inasmuch as he owns a larger total percentage of the stock of N Corporation under such rules; and the attribution rules of paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and (c)(2) of this section are used with respect to B inasmuch as he owns a larger total percentage of the stock of N Corporation under such rules.
