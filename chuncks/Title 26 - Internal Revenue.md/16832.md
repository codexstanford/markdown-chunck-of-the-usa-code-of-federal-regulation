####### Transferred basis rule.,2

(2)If any person acquires property from another person who acquired the property by purchase (determined with regard to section 355(d)(5) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(2), (3) and (4) of this section, but without regard to section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section), and the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the acquirer is determined in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the other person, the acquirer is treated as having acquired the property by purchase on the date it was so acquired by the other person. The rule in this paragraph (e)(2) applies, for example, where stock of a corporation acquired by purchase is subsequently acquired in a section 351 transfer or a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(B), but does not apply if the stock of a former common parent is acquired in a group structure change to which ยง 1.1502-31 applies. But see paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B)() of this section for situations where the stock is treated as purchased on the date of a transfer.
