()-()U.S.C. is a domestic life insurance company that has $300x; of gross income, consisting of $100x of foreign source general category income and $200x of U.S. source passive category interest income, $100x; of the latter of which is tax-exempt interest income from municipal bonds under section 103. U.S.C.'s opening balance of its section 807(c) reserves is $50,000x; and USP's closing balance of its section 807(c) reserves is $50,130x. Under section 807(b)(1)(B), USP's closing balance of its section 807(c) reserves, $50,130x, is reduced by the amount of the policyholder's share of tax-exempt interest. The policyholder's share of tax-exempt interest under section 812(b) is equal to 30 percent of the $100x of tax-exempt interest ($30x). Therefore, under sections 803(a)(2) and 807(b), USP's reserve deduction is $100x ($50,130x of reserve deduction minus $30x (30 percent of $100x of tax-exempt interest), minus $50,000x). U.S.C. has no other income or deductions.
