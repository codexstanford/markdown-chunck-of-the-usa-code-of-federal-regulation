####### 2,Transfer of Q stock to a partnership in a section 721(a) transaction.

()In 2024, B transfers its Q stock to B2, a partnership, in a section 721(a) transaction. Although a section 721(a) transaction is not an inclusion event under ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(7), under the acceleration rule of ยง 1.1502-13(d), S must take into account its $90x of remaining deferred gain because B2 has benefited from an increased basis in the Q stock as a result of the intercompany sale between S and B such that this is the appropriate time to take the remaining deferred gain into account. S's deferred capital gain of $150x is taken into account in 2024 for the same reason.
