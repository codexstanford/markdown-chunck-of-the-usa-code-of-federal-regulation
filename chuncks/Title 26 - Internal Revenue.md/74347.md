(ii) All of the State income tax laws applicable to individuals (including laws relating to the collection or administration of such taxes or to the prosecution of alleged civil or criminal violations with respect to such taxes) which the State would not expect the United States to administer but which may be in effect simultaneously (for any period of time) with the State agreement.

(iii) All of the State laws other than individual income tax laws which provide for the making of any payments by the State based on one or more criteria which the State may desire to verify by reference to information contained in returns of qualified taxes.

(iv) All of the State laws which may be in effect simultaneously (for any period of time) with the State agreement and which provide for cooperation or reciprocal agreement between the electing State and another State with respect to income taxes applicable to individuals.
