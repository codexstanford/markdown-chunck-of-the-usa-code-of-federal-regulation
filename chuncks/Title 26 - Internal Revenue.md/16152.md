####### Time and manner of filing certification.

(ii)The certification described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section must be made in a separate statement entitled "[insert name and employer identification number of common parent] hereby certifies under § 1.337(d)-1 (e)(3) that the group of which it is the common parent is applying § 1.1502-20T to all transactions to which that section otherwise applied by it terms." The statement must be signed by the common parent and filed with the group's income tax return for the taxable year of the first disposition or deconsolidation to which the certification applies. If the separate statement required under this paragraph (e)(3) is to be filed with a return the due date (including extensions) of which is before November 16, 1991, the statement may be filed with an amended return for the year of the disposition or deconsolidation that is filed within 180 days after September 13, 1991. Any other filings required under § 1.1502-20T, such as the statement required under § 1.1502-20T(f)(5), may be made with the amended return, regardless of whether § 1.1502-20T permits such filing by amended return.
