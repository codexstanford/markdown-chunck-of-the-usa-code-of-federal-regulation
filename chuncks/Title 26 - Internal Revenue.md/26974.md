####### Standard cost method,In general.

(3)-(i)A taxpayer may use the so-called "standard cost" method of allocating inventoriable costs to the goods in ending inventory, provided he treats variances in accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. The method used by the taxpayer in allocating such costs in his financial reports shall be given great weight in determining whether the taxpayer's method employed for tax purposes fairly allocates indirect production costs to the ending inventory. For purposes of this subparagraph, a "net positive overhead variance" shall mean the excess of total standard (or estimated) indirect production costs over total actual indirect production costs and a "net negative overhead variance" shall mean the excess of total actual indirect production costs over total standard (or estimated) indirect production costs.
