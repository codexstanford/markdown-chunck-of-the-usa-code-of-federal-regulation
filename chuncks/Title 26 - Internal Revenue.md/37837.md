###### ยง 1.901(m)-5 Basis difference taken into account.
####### Basis difference taken into account under applicable cost recovery method,In general.

(b)-(1)When the RFA owner (U.S.) is a section 901(m) payor, all of a cost recovery amount is attributed to the section 901(m) payor and assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the corresponding U.S. basis deduction is taken into account under the applicable cost recovery method. This is the case regardless of whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes. If instead the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes, a cost recovery amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section. If a cost recovery amount arises from an RFA with respect to a section 743(b) CAA, in certain cases the cost recovery amount is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (e) of this section. In certain cases in which the RFA owner (U.S.) either is a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid, a cost recovery amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (g) of this section.
