####### Analysis.

(B)Pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-5(b)(2), Y deducts its $100x of current-year business interest expense (as defined in ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)) before any disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (including X's carryforwards) from a prior taxable year are deducted. The aggregate disallowed business interest expense of X carried forward under section 381(c)(20) to Y's taxable year ending December 31, 2022, is $750x. However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for Y's first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the maximum amount of X's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that Y can deduct is equal to the post-acquisition portion of Y's section 163(j) limitation. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the post-acquisition portion of Y's section 163(j) limitation means Y's section 163(j) limitation times the ratio of the number of days in the taxable year after the date of distribution or transfer to the total number of days in that year. Therefore, only $84x of the aggregate amount ($500x x (61/365) = $84x) may be deducted by Y in that year, and the remaining $666x ($750x-$84x = $666x) is carried forward to the succeeding taxable year.
