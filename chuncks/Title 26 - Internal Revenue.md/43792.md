####### 3,Analysis of the second tier of the fallback waterfall.,i.e.,

()As provided in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) and (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, B and L must apply the rules in paragraphs (h)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section to determine whether the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate. Because the likelihood that Benchmark X will be discontinued is not remote, paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C) of this section has no effect on the analysis of the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall. Under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, because it is not possible to determine at the time of the fallback waterfall's addition in 2022 whether the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall (the replacement rate that B will select in 2023) satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is treated as not satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate.
