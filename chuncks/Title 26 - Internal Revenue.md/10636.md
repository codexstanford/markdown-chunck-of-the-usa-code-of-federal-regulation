If the contribution includes an item of property, other than money or securities which are regularly traded on a stock exchange or in an over-the-counter market, which the donee deems to have a fair market value in excess of $500 ($200 in the case of a charitable contribution made in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1983) at the time of receipt, such statement shall also indicate for each such item its location if it is retained by the organization, the amount received by the organization on any sale of the property and the date of sale or, in case of any other disposition of the property, the method of disposition. In the case of any contribution of tangible personal property, the statement shall indicate the use of the property by the organization and whether or not it is used for a purpose or function constituting the basis for the donee organization's exemption from income tax under section 501 or, in the case of a governmental unit, whether or not it is used for exclusively public purposes.
