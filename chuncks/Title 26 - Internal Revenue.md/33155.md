####### Section 481(a) adjustment.

(B)A change in method of accounting to the annual method is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 481(a) apply. Thus, a section 481(a) adjustment must be taken into account to prevent the omission or duplication of income. If all the co-producers under a JOA have the same taxable year, the section 481(a) adjustment involved in a change to the annual method by a co-producer relating to the JOA is computed as of the first day of the co-producer's year of change. If the co-producers under a JOA do not all have the same taxable year (that is, in the case of a part-year change described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section), the change in method of accounting occurs on January 1, 1996, and the section 481(a) adjustment is computed on that date.
