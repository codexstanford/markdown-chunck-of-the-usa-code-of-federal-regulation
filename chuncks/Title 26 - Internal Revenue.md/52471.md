####### Overlap

(ii)-(A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (a) of this section and the application of section 382 with respect to built-in losses occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 382(a) limitation that would apply with respect to the corporation's recognized built-in losses (the section 382 event). Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, application of the overlap rule does not require that the size and composition of the corporation's net unrealized built-in loss is the same on the date of the section 382 event and the SRLY event.

(B) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup and/or a loss subgroup as defined in ยง 1.1502-91(d)(2) with respect to built-in losses, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
