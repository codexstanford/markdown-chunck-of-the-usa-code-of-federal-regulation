###### Discrimination.

(2)The determination as to whether a plan discriminates in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated, is made on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case, allowing a reasonable difference between the percentage of such employees benefited by the plan to all employees benefited by the plan and the percentage of all such employees of the employer to all employees of the employer. A showing that a specified percentage of employees covered by a plan are not officers, shareholders, or highly compensated, without a showing that the difference (if any) between such percentage and the percentage of all employees who are not officers, shareholders, or highly compensated is reasonable, is not sufficient to establish that the plan does not discriminate in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated.
