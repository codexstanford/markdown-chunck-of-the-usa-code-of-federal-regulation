(F) Outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee if the property was previously shipped by the seller or lessor from the United States and if the property is located outside the United States pursuant to a prior lease by the seller or lessor, and either () the prior lease terminated at the expiration of its term (or by the action of the prior lessee acting alone), () the sale occurred or the term of the subsequent lease began after the time at which the term of the prior lease would have expired, or () the lessee under the subsequent lease is not a related person with respect to the lessor and the prior lease was terminated by the action of the lessor (acting alone or together with the lessee).

(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) (other than paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(C) and (F)(3)), any relationship between the seller or lessor and any purchaser, subsequent purchaser, lessee, or sublessee is immaterial.

(iii) In no event is the destination test of this paragraph (d)(2) satisfied with respect to property which is subject to any use (other than a resale or sublease), manufacture, assembly, or other processing (other than packaging) by any person between the time of the sale or lease by such seller or lessor and the delivery or ultimate delivery outside the United States described in this paragraph (d)(2).

(iv) If property is located outside the United States at the time it is purchased by a person or leased by a person as lessee, such property may be export property in the hands of such purchaser or lessee only if it is imported into the United States prior to its further sale or lease (including a sublease) outside the United States. Paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section (relating to the 50 percent foreign content test) are applicable in determining whether such property is export property. Thus, for example, if such property is not subjected to manufacturing or production (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) within the United States after such importation, it does not qualify as export property.
