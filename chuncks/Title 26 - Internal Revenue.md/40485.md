####### Selling activity.

(iv)If a person is liable with regard to selling activity performed, such liability will be considered, except as provided in subdivisions (iii), (v), and (vi) of this subparagraph, to result from such selling activity. A person will be considered to be engaged in selling activity if such person engages in an activity resulting in the sale of property. Thus, it is immaterial that, under the Code, such activity would not constitute engaging in or carrying on a trade or business in the country in which such activity is carried on, the property in the goods does not pass in such country, or delivery of the property is not made in such country. For example, if a foreign wholesale distributor, which manages its entire business operations in a foreign country and sells its inventory exclusively in the United States-its only contact in the United States being the promotion of such sales to United States retail outlets by advertising in trade publications and distributing sales catalogues-is liable for a breach of warranty with regard to the sale of property to a United States retail outlet, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States.
