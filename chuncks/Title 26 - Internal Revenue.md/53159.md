####### Allocation of income and losses,In general.

(h)-(1)Paragraphs (h)(2) through (5) of this section provides rules for allocating different losses among thrifts that have tentative taxable income greater than zero. Generally, these allocations are made in the order listed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and are based upon the relative tentative taxable income of the thrifts to which the particular loss is allocated. For purposes of each allocation under a subdivision of such paragraph (f)(1), the tentative taxable income of the thrifts used in making this allocation is reduced by the thrift's allocable share of losses allocated to the thrift under a prior subdivision of such paragraph (f)(1). Accordingly, for purposes of this paragraph (h), tentative taxable income is determined without regard to paragraph (f) of this section, except as otherwise provided. Paragraph (h)(6) of this section provides rules for allocating income attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift based upon the relative reductions to thrift income made on account of that nonthrift.
