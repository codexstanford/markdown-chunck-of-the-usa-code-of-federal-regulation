####### Required change in method of accounting for certain joint operating agreements.

(C)This paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) applies to certain JOAs entered into prior to 1996. Except in the case of a part-year change in method of accounting or in the case of the cessation of a JOA (both of which are described in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)), for each JOA entered into prior to a co-producer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, and in effect as of the beginning of that year, the co-producer must change its method of accounting for sales of gas and its treatment of certain related deductions and credits to a permissible method as of the start of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994. In the case of a JOA of co-producers that do not all have the same taxable year and that choose the annual gas balancing method, if the JOA is entered into prior to the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994 of the co-producer whose taxable year begins latest in the calendar year and the JOA is in effect as of January 1, 1996, a change to the annual gas balancing method by each co-producer under that JOA is made as of January 1, 1996 (part-year change in method of accounting). If the co-producers would have made a part-year change to the annual gas balancing method but for the fact that their JOA ceased to be in effect before January 1, 1996 (cessation of a JOA), the co-producers do not change their method of accounting with respect to the JOA. Rather, for their taxable years in which the JOA ceases to be in effect, the co-producers use their current method of accounting with respect to that JOA.
