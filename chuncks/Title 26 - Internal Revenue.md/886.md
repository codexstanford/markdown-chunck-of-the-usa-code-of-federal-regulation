####### Recordkeeping and record retention provisions,Recordkeeping provision.

(b)-(1)Under the recordkeeping provision, the owner of a low-income housing project must be required to keep records for each qualified low-income building in the project that show for each year in the compliance period-

(i) The total number of residential rental units in the building (including the number of bedrooms and the size in square feet of each residential rental unit);

(ii) The percentage of residential rental units in the building that are low-income units;

(iii) The rent charged on each residential rental unit in the building (including any utility allowances);

(iv) The number of occupants in each low-income unit, but only if rent is determined by the number of occupants in each unit under section 42(g)(2) (as in effect before the amendments made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989);

(v) The low-income unit vacancies in the building and information that shows when, and to whom, the next available units were rented;

(vi) The annual income certification of each low-income tenant per unit. For an exception to this requirement, see section 42(g)(8)(B) (which provides a special rule for a 100 percent low-income building);

(vii) Documentation to support each low-income tenant's income certification (for example, a copy of the tenant's federal income tax return, Forms W-2, or verifications of income from third parties such as employers or state agencies paying unemployment compensation). For an exception to this requirement, see section 42(g)(8)(B) (which provides a special rule for a 100 percent low-income building). Tenant income is calculated in a manner consistent with the determination of annual income under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 ("Section 8"), not in accordance with the determination of gross income for federal income tax liability. In the case of a tenant receiving housing assistance payments under Section 8, the documentation requirement of this paragraph (b)(1)(vii) is satisfied if the public housing authority provides a statement to the building owner declaring that the tenant's income does not exceed the applicable income limit under section 42 (g);

(viii) The eligible basis and qualified basis of the building at the end of the first year of the credit period; and

(ix) The character and use of the nonresidential portion of the building included in the building's eligible basis under section 42 (d) (e.g., tenant facilities that are available on a comparable basis to all tenants and for which no separate fee is charged for use of the facilities, or facilities reasonably required by the project).
