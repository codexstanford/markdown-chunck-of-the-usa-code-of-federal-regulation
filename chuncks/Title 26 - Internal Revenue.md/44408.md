####### Partner recognition of gain.

(5)At the time that either the partner or the purchasing partnership (whichever applies) sells or exchanges replacement QSB stock, the amount recognized by the partner is determined by taking into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. Similarly, a partner of an upper-tier partnership that owns an interest in a lower-tier partnership that holds replacement QSB stock must take into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section in determining the amount recognized by the partner on a sale of the interest in the lower-tier partnership by the upper-tier partnership or the partner's distributive share of gain from the upper-tier partnership. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section for rules applicable to certain distributions of replacement QSB stock.
