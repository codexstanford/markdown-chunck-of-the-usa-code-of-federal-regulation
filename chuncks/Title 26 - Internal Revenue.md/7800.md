()If a corporation (S) leaves a consolidated group (Group 1) in a transaction that requires an adjustment under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section, no further adjustment is required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) or (E) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E) of this section in a separate return year (as defined in ยง 1.1502-1(e)) of S with respect to depreciation, amortization, or depletion deductions allowed or allowable to Group 1. See paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section for special rules regarding the meaning of the term "sale or other disposition" for purposes of the adjustments required under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(C) through (E) and paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (E) of this section. For example, assume that S deconsolidates from Group 1 in a transaction not described in ยง 1.1502-13(j)(5)(i) after holding property for which depreciation, amortization, or depletion deductions were allowed or allowable in Group 1. On the deconsolidation, S and Group 1 would adjust tentative taxable income with regard to that property. See paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(A)(), (b)(1)(ii)(D), and (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section. If, following the deconsolidation, S sells the property referred to in the previous sentence, no subtraction from tentative taxable income is made under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section during S's separate return year with regard to the amounts included in Group 1. See paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(A)(), (b)(1)(ii)(D), and (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section.
