####### Nonfunctional currency tax liability and non-dollar functional currency.,Example 3

(2)If the functional currency of the QBU receiving the refund is not the dollar and is different from the currency in which the foreign income taxes were paid, then the recipient's basis in the refunded foreign currency is equal to the functional currency value of the nonfunctional currency refund, translated into functional currency at the appropriate exchange rate between the functional currency and the nonfunctional currency. Such exchange rate is determined under the principles of paragraph (c) of this section, substituting the words "functional currency" for the word "dollar" and using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount into the QBU's functional currency when claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes (as defined in ยง 1.960-3(d)(1)). If a QBU receives a refund of nonfunctional currency tax that is denominated in a currency that was the functional currency of the QBU when the refunded tax was claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes, the QBU's basis in the nonfunctional currency received in the refund is determined by using the exchange rate used under ยง 1.985-5(c) when the QBU's functional currency changed. See ยง 1.905-3(b)(1)(ii)(C) ().
