() The lessee has basis in the principal balance of the lessee's section 467 loan immediately before the substitute lessee first has use of the property.

(B) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D) of this section, the excess, if any, of the beginning balance of the amount owed to the substitute lessee under the section 467 loan, over any consideration paid by the substitute lessee to the lessee in conjunction with the transfer of the use of the property, is treated as an amount incurred by the lessee for the taxable year in which the substitute lessee first has use of the property.

(C) To the extent the beginning balance of the amount owed to the substitute lessee under the section 467 loan exceeds any consideration paid by the substitute lessee to the lessee in conjunction with the transfer of the use of the property, repayments of the beginning balance are items of gross income of the substitute lessee in the taxable year in which repayment occurs (determined by applying any repayment first to the beginning balance of the substitute lessee's section 467 loan).

(D) Any amount incurred by the lessee under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section with respect to a transfer of the use of property (the current transfer) shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the extent that the lessee, in its capacity, if any, as a substitute lessee with respect to an earlier transfer of the use of the property would have recognized additional gross income under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section if the current transfer had not occurred.

(v) For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, repayments occur as the negative balance is amortized through the net accrual of rent and negative interest.
