###### § 1.905-3 Adjustments to U.S. tax liability and to current earnings and profits as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
####### 2,Analysis.

()USC's payment in Year 6 of the 10u of additional tax accrued with respect to Year 1 is a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the additional tax is taken into account in Year 1, the year to which the redetermined tax relates, irrespective of when the tax is paid. Under § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), because the tax was paid more than 24 months after the close of the year to which the redetermined tax relates, the 10u of tax is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment in Year 6 (10u at $1.10x:1u = $11x). If USC timely notifies the IRS, it may claim an increased foreign tax credit for Year 1. USC must also make corresponding adjustments in determining its taxable income and net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in Year 1. See §§ 1.987-3(c)(2)(v) and 1.987-4(d)(7).
