####### Ordering rule.

(viii)If a portion of the amount payable under a plan or arrangement is a grandfathered amount and a portion is subject to this section, and payment under the plan or arrangement is made in a series of payments (including payments as a life annuity), the grandfathered amount is allocated to the first payment of an amount under the plan or arrangement that is otherwise deductible. If the grandfathered amount exceeds the initial payment, the excess is allocated to the next payment of an amount under the plan or arrangement that is otherwise deductible, and this process is repeated until the entire grandfathered amount has been paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for amounts otherwise deductible for taxable years ending before December 20, 2019, the grandfathered amount may be allocated to each payment on a pro rata basis or to the last otherwise deductible payment. If one of these two methods was used for taxable years ending before December 20, 2019, then, for taxable years ending on or after December 20, 2019, the method must be changed to allocate any remaining grandfathered amount to the first payment for the remaining payments (treating as the first payment the first otherwise deductible amount for taxable years ending on or after December 20, 2019).
