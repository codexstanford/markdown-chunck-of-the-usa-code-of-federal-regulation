######## Calculating the number of returns.

(5)For purposes of this section, a corporation or controlled group of corporations is required to file at least 10 returns if, during the calendar year ending with or within the taxable year of the corporation or the controlled group, the corporation or the controlled group is required to file at least 10 returns of any type, including information returns (for example, Forms W-2 and Forms 1099), income tax returns, employment tax returns, and excise tax returns. In the case of a short-period return, a corporation is required to file at least 10 returns if, during the calendar year in which the corporation's short taxable year ends, the corporation is required to file at least 10 returns of any type, including information returns (for example, Forms W-2 and Forms 1099), income tax returns, employment tax returns, and excise tax returns. If the corporation is a member of a controlled group, calculating the number of returns the corporation is required to file includes all returns required to be filed by all members of the controlled group during the calendar year ending with or within the taxable year of the controlled group.
