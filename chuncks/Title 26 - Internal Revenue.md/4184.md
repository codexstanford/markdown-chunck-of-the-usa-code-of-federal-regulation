## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury

#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Items Specifically Included in Gross Income
###### ยง 1.79-2 Exceptions to the rule of inclusion.
####### Insurance contracts purchased under qualified employee plans.

(d)(1) Section 79(b)(3) provides an exception with respect to the cost of any group-term life insurance which is provided under a life insurance contract purchased as a part of a plan described in section 403(a), or purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) if the proceeds of such contract are payable directly or indirectly to a participant in such trust or to a beneficiary of such participant. The provisions of section 72(m)(3) and ยง 1.72-16 apply to the cost of such group-term life insurance, and, therefore, no part of such cost is excluded from the gross income of the employee by reason of the provisions of section 79.

(2) Whether the life insurance protection on an employee's life is provided under a qualified employee plan referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph depends upon the provisions of such plan. In determining whether a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or annuity plan satisfies the requirements for qualification set forth in sections 401(a) or 403(a), only group-term life insurance which is provided under such plan is taken into account.
