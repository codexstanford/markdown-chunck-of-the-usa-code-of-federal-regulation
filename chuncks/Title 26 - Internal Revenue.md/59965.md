##### ยง 1.402(g)-2 Increased limit for catch-up contributions.
###### Participants in multiple plans.

(b)Paragraph (a) of this section applies without regard to whether the applicable employer plans (within the meaning of section 414(v)(6)) treat the elective deferrals as catch-up contributions. Thus, a catch-up eligible participant who makes elective deferrals under applicable employer plans of two or more employers that in total exceed the applicable dollar amount under section 402(g)(1) by an amount that does not exceed the applicable dollar catch-up limit under either plan may exclude the elective deferrals from gross income, even if neither applicable employer plan treats those elective deferrals as catch-up contributions.
