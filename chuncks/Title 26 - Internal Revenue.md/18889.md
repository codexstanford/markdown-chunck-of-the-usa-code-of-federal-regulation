####### Ordinary course indebtedness.

(iv)For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), indebtedness arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business only if the indebtedness is incurred by the loss corporation in connection with the normal, usual, or customary conduct of business, determined without regard to whether the indebtedness funds ordinary or capital expenditures of the loss corporation. For example, indebtedness (other than indebtedness acquired for a principal purpose of being exchanged for stock) arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if it is trade debt; a tax liability; a liability arising from a past or present employment relationship, a past or present business relationship with a supplier, customer, or competitor of the loss corporation, a tort, a breach of warranty, or a breach of statutory duty; or indebtedness incurred to pay an expense deductible under section 162 or included in the cost of goods sold. A claim that arises upon the rejection of a burdensome contract or lease pursuant to the title 11 or similar case is treated as arising in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if the contract or lease so arose.
