###### ยง 1.46-2 Carryback and carryover of unused credit.
####### In general.

(b)Under section 46(b)(1), unused credit may be carried back and carried over. Carrybacks and carryovers of unused credit are taken into account in determining the amount of credit available and the credit allowed for the taxable years to which they may be carried. In general, the application of the rules of this section to regular and ESOP credits are separate from their application to nonrefundable energy credits. For example, the limitations on carrybacks and carryovers of unused nonrefundable energy credit under section 46(b) (2) and (3), respectively, differ in amount from the limitations on the regular and ESOP credits because the tax liability limitations for those credits differ. See ยง 1.46-1(h). For a further example, see the special ordering rule in ยง 1.46-1(m). Section 46(b) does not apply to the refundable energy credit.
