####### Application to adjustment to basis of partnership property under section 734(b) or 743(b).

(8)Any increase in the basis of partnership property under section 734(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to basis of undistributed partnership property) or section 743(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to the basis of partnership property) will be taken into account under this section by a partner as if the increased portion of the basis were attributable to the partner's acquisition of the underlying partnership property on the date the distribution or transfer occurs. For example, if a section 754 election is in effect and, as a result of its acquisition of a partnership interest, a taxpayer obtains an increased basis in an intangible held through the partnership, the increased portion of the basis in the intangible will be treated as an intangible asset newly acquired by that taxpayer on the date of the transaction.
