####### Example 23. Treatment of disregarded item and books and records of a hybrid entity,Facts.

(23)-(i)P owns DE1which, in turn, owns FS. In year 1, P borrows from a third party and on-lends the proceeds to DE1. In year 1, P incurs interest expense attributable to the third-party loan. Also in year 1, DE1incurs interest expense attributable to its loan from P, but such expense is generally disregarded for U.S. tax purposes because DE1is disregarded as an entity separate from P. The third-party loan and related interest expense are reflected on the books and records of P (and not on the books and records of DE1). The loan from P to DE1and related interest expense are reflected on the books and records of DE1. There are no other items of income, gain, deduction, or loss reflected on the books and records of DE1in year 1.
