####### Earned income from business in which capital is material.,net profits of the trade or business

(3)(i) If an individual is engaged in a trade or business (other than in corporate form) in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors, a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services actually rendered by the individual shall be considered earned income, but the total amount which shall be treated as the earned income of the individual from such a trade or business shall in no case exceed 30 percent of his share of the net profits of such trade or business (which share shall include any guaranteed payment (as defined by ยง 1.707-1(c)) received from a partnership). For purpose of the preceding sentence, the termmeans the excess of gross income from such trade or business (including income from all sources, whether or not subject to Federal income tax, and without taking into account any deductions which may be allowable under section 1202) over the deductions attributable to such trade or business.

(ii) Whether capital is a material income-producing factor must be determined by reference to all the facts of each case. Capital is a material income-producing factor if a substantial portion of the gross income of the business is attributable to the employment of capital in the business, as reflected, for example, by a substantial investment in inventories, plant, machinery, or other equipment. In general, capital is not a material income-producing factor where gross income of the business consists principally of fees, commissions, or other compensation for personal services performed by an individual. Thus, the practice of his profession by a doctor, dentist, lawyer, architect, or accountant will not, as such, be treated as a trade or business in which capital is a material income-producing factor even though the practitioner may have a substantial capital investment in professional equipment or in the physical plant constituting the office from which he conducts his practice since his capital investment is regarded as only incidental to his professional practice.

(iii) This subparagraph does not apply to gains and net earnings derived from the sale or other disposition of, the transfer of any interest in, or the licensing of the use of property by an individual whose personal efforts created such property which are, by reason of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, treated as earned income. Thus, for example, a research chemist's substantial capital investment in laboratory facilities which he uses to produce patentable chemical processes from which he derives gains within the meaning of this subdivision would not be considered a material income-producing factor.
