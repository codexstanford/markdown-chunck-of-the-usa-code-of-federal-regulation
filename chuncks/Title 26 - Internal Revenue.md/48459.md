####### Inclusion year treatment.

(ii)The gain so included per paragraph (c)(1) of this section is subject to the same Federal income tax provisions and rates that would apply to any other gains that are realized and recognized at the same time as the included gain and that have the same attributes as the deferred gain. For example, when a deferred qualified 1231 gain, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section, is required to be included in income, the included section 1231 gain is treated as if it were a section 1231 gain (within the meaning of section 1231(a)(3)(A)) that was recognized on the date of inclusion.
