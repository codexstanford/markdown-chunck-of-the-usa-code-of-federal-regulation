###### Manner of revoking election.

(a)A taxpayer may revoke an election made by him under section 615(e) or section 617(a) by filing with the internal revenue officer with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed, within the periods set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, a statement, signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative, which sets forth that the taxpayer is revoking the election previously made by him with respect to the deduction of mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and states with whom the document making the election was filed. A taxpayer revoking such an election shall file amended income tax returns, reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the revocation of election, for all taxable years affected by the revocation of election. See section 617(a)(2)(C) for provisions relating to the tolling of the statute of limitations for the assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year, to the extent the deficiency is attributable to an election or revocation of election under section 617(a). In applying the revocation of an election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the revocation of election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is limited by the taxpayer's taxable income, and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on other taxable years.
