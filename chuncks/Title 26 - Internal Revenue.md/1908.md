####### Amount of qualified progress expenditures for transferee.

(3)(i) If the transfer does not require recapture under section 47(a)(3) and ยง 147-1(g), and the election carries over to the taxpayer under paragraph (o)(3) of this section, the transferee must determine its qualified progress expenditures-

(A) By using the same normal construction period used by the transferor,

(B) By treating the property as having the same status as self-constructed or non-self-constructed as the property had in the hands of the transferor, and

(C) In the case of non-self-constructed property, by taking into account any excess described in section 46(d)(4)(C)(i) (relating to the excess of payments over the percentage-of-completion limitation) or section 46(d)(4)(C)(ii) (relating to the excess of the percentage-of-completion limitation over the amount of payments) that the transferor would have taken into account with respect to that property.

(ii) If the transfer requires recapture under section 47(a)(3) and ยง 1.47-1(g) (or would require recapture if the transferor had made an election under section 46(d)), the amount paid or incurred for the transfer will be considered a payment for construction of that property to the extent that-

(A) It is properly includible in the basis of the property under ยง 1.46-3(c),

(B) The taxpayer can show the amount is attributable to construction costs paid or chargeable to capital account by the transferor or other person after physical work on construction of the property began, and

(C) It does not exceed the amount by which the transferor has increased qualified investment for qualified progress expenditures incurred with respect to the property (or would have increased qualified investment but for the "lesser of" limitation of section 46(d)(3)(B) or the absence of an election under section 46(d)), plus any amount that would have been treated as a qualified progress expenditure by the transferor had the property not been transferred.
