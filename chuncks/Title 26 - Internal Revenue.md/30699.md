(ii)To qualify under this subdivision the trust must have been established by the will of a testator who died after October 9, 1969, and who at no time after that date had the right to change any portion of such will pertaining to such trust. This subdivision could apply, for example, where a contract has been entered into for the execution of wills containing reciprocal provisions as well as provisions for the benefit of an organization described in section 170(c) and under applicable local law the surviving testator is prohibited from revoking his will because he has accepted the benefit of the provisions of the will of the other contracting party.
