####### Special rule for certain reset bonds.

(f)Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph (f) provides a special rule for a variable rate debt instrument that provides for stated interest at a fixed rate for an initial interval, and provides that on the date immediately following the end of the initial interval (the effective date) the stated interest rate will be a rate determined under a procedure (such as an auction procedure) so that the fair market value of the instrument on the effective date will be a fixed amount (the reset value). Solely for purposes of calculating the accrual of OID, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as-

(1) Maturing on the date immediately preceding the effective date for an amount equal to the reset value; and

(2) Reissued on the effective date for an amount equal to the reset value.
