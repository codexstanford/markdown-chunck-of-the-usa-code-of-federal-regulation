() Under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, the redemption of the FA stock deemed received by TFC in exchange for the TFD stock shall not constitute a disposition if UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer that includes appropriate provisions to take into account such redemption. Therefore, under the new gain recognition agreement UST must agree to treat as a triggering event a complete or partial disposition of the stock of FA. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, UST is permitted to enter into a single new gain recognition agreement in year 3, but the gain recognition agreement must provide a complete description of the section 304(a)(1) transaction including the deemed section 351 exchange and redemption of the FA stock.
