###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### ii,Application of the matching rule.

()Under the matching rule in ยง 1.1502-13(c), the timing, character, source, and other attributes of USS's $350x intercompany item and P's $350x corresponding item are redetermined to produce the effect of transactions between divisions of a single corporation, as if the services payment had been made to a foreign branch of that corporation. Accordingly, all of USS's foreign source income of $350x is redetermined to be U.S. source, rather than foreign source, income. Therefore, for purposes of ยง 1.1502-4(c)(1), the P group has $600x of foreign passive category income, $50x of U.S. source general category income, and $350x of U.S. source foreign branch category income.
