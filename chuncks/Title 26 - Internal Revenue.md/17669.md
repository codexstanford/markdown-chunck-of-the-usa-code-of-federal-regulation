###### ยง 1.367(a)-8 Gain recognition agreement requirements.
####### 2

() Under paragraph (o)(6) of this section and the principles of paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section, because the year 4 sale of the TFC stock to X requires UST to take into account the $40x gain (the intercompany item) from the year 3 distribution, the year 4 sale terminates the gain recognition agreement. If, alternatively, in year 4 USP had sold only 30% of the TFC stock, then under paragraph (o)(6) of this section and the principles of paragraph (o)(1)(ii) of this section the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement would be reduced by 30%.
