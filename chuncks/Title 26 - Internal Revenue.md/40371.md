####### 2,Tested interest expense and tested interest income of FS2.

()FS2 has $100x of interest income that is included in gross tested income. Accordingly, FS2 has $100x of tested interest income. FS2 also has 100x of interest expense that is allocated and apportioned to its gross tested income. However, because FS2 is a tested loss CFC, FS2's tested interest expense is reduced by its tested loss QBAI amount. FS2's tested loss QBAI amount is $100x (10% of $1,000x, the amount that would be QBAI if FS2 were a tested income CFC). Accordingly, FS2's tested interest expense is $0 ($100x interest expense-$100x tested loss QBAI amount) for Year 1.
