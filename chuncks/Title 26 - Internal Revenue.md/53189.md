####### Subgroup loss.

(ii)A subgroup loss does not actually affect the computation of nonlife consolidated taxable income or consolidated LICTI. It merely constitutes a bottom-line adjustment in reaching consolidated taxable income. Furthermore, the amount of a subgroup's loss, if any, that is eligible to be carried back to a prior taxable year first must be carried back against income of the same subgroup before it may be used as a setoff against the other subgroup's income in the taxable year the loss arose. (See sections 172(b)(1) and 1503(c)(1); see also ยง 1.1502-21(b).) The carryback of losses from one subgroup may not be used to offset income of the other subgroup in the year to which the loss is to be carried. This carryback of one subgroup's loss may "bump" the other subgroup's loss that, in effect, previously reduced the income of the first subgroup. The subgroup's loss that is bumped in appropriate cases may, in effect, reduce a succeeding year's income of either subgroup. This approach gives the group the tax savings of the use of losses, but the bumping rule assures that, insofar as possible, life deductions will be matched against life income and nonlife deductions against nonlife income.
