####### Proof of intent,a,In general.

(ii)-()Ordinarily, the existence or non-existance of an understanding at the time of original issue that the obligation will be redeemed before maturity shall be determined by an examination of all of the circumstances under which the obligation was issued and held. The fact that the obligation is issued with provisions on its face giving the issuer the privilege of redeeming the obligation before maturity is not determinative of an intention to call before maturity; likewise, the absence of such provision is not determinative of the absence of an intention to call before maturity. However, such provision, or the absence of such provision, is one of the circumstances to be given consideration along with other factors in determining whether an understanding existed. If the obligation was part of an issue registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and was sold to the public (whether or not sold directly to the public by the obligor) without representation to the public that the obligor intends to call the obligation before maturity, there shall be a presumption that no intention to call the obligation before maturity was in existence at the time of original issue. The existence of a provision on the face of an obligation giving the issuer the privilege of redeeming the obligation before maturity shall not in and of itself overcome the presumption set forth in the preceding sentence.
