##### Seizure of Property for Collection of Taxes
###### ยง 301.6343-1 Requirement to release levy and notice of release.
####### Liability satisfied or unenforceable,General rule.

(1)-(i)The liability for which the levy was made is satisfied or the period of limitations provided in section 6502 (and any period during which the period of limitations is suspended as provided by law) has lapsed. A levy is considered made on the date on which the notice of seizure provided in section 6335(a) is given. A levy that is made within the period of limitations provided in section 6502 does not become unenforceable simply because the person who receives the levy does not surrender the subject property within the period of limitations. In this case, the liability remains enforceable to the extent of the value of the levied upon property. However, a levy made outside the period of limitations (normally ten years without suspensions) must be released unless-

(A) The taxpayer agreed in writing to extend the period of limitations as provided in section 6502(a)(2) and ยง 301.6502-1; or

(B) A proceeding in court to collect the liability has begun within the period of limitations.
