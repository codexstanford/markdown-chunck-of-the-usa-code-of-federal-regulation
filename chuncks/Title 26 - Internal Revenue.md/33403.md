####### Distributions to shareholders defined.,distribution,,property

(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 815(f) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the termas used in section 815(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, means any distribution of property made by a life insurance company to its shareholders. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the termmeans any property (including money, securities, and indebtedness to the company) other than stock, or rights to acquire stock, in the company making the distribution. Thus, for example, the term includes a distribution which is considered a dividend under section 316, but is not limited to the extent that such distribution must be made out of the accumulated or current earnings and profits of the company making the distribution. For example, except as otherwise provided in section 815(f) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, there is a distribution within the meaning of this paragraph in any case in which a corporation acquires the stock of a shareholder in exchange for property in a redemption treated as a distribution in exchange for stock under section 302(a) or treated as a distribution of property under section 302(d). For special rules relating to distributions to shareholders in acquisition of stock pursuant to a plan of mutualization, see section 815(e) and paragraph (e) of ยง 1.815-6.
