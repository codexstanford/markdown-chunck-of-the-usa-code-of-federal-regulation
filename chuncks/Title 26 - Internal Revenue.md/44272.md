###### ยง 1.1038-1 Reacquisitions of real property in satisfaction of indebtedness.
####### Persons from whom real property may be reacquired.

(4)The real property reacquired in satisfaction of the indebtedness need not be reacquired from the purchaser but may be reacquired from the purchaser's transferee or assignee, or from a trustee holding title to such property pending the purchaser's satisfaction of the terms of the contract, so long as the indebtedness that is partially or completely satisfied in the reacquisition of such property arose in the original sale of the property and was secured by the property so reacquired. In such a case, a reference in this section to the purchaser shall, where appropriate, include the purchaser's transferee or assignee. Thus, for example, this section will apply if the seller reacquires the property from a purchaser from the original purchaser and either the property is subject to, or the subsequent purchaser assumes, the liability to the seller on the indebtedness.
