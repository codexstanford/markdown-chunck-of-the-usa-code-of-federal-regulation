(ii)Under § 1.1503(d)-1(b)(4)(i)(A), P's and S's shares of FBowned indirectly through their interests in PRSare individual foreign branch separate units. Pursuant to § 1.1503(b)-1(b)(4)(ii), these individual separate units are combined and treated as a single separate unit of the consolidated group of which P is the parent. Unless an exception under § 1.1503(d)-6 applies, any dual consolidated loss attributable to FBcannot offset income of P or S (other than income attributable to FB, subject to the application of § 1.1503(d)-4(c)), including their distributive share of the U.S. source income earned through their interests in PRS, nor can it offset income of any other domestic affiliates.
