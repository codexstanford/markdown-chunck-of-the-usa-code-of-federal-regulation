()The responsible officer of a compliance FI must make the certification described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section (preexisting account certification of a participating FFI) with respect to each electing FFI that elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program under the compliance FI during the certification period. However, a preexisting account certification is not required for an electing FFI if immediately before electing to be part of the consolidated compliance program under the compliance FI the FFI was a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is a local FFI or restricted fund, and the FFI (or the FFI's former compliance FI, if applicable) provides a written certification to the compliance FI that the FFI has made the preexisting account certification required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section or ยง 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(A)() or (f)(1)(i)(D)() (as applicable), unless the compliance FI knows that such written certification is unreliable or incorrect. In addition, a preexisting account certification is not required for an electing FFI that elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program under the compliance FI during the two year period before the end of the certification period, provided that the compliance FI makes the preexisting account certification for such FFI for the subsequent certification period. The certification required under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)() for the certification period must be submitted by the due date of the FFI's certification of compliance required under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)()() of this section for the certification period, on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS.
