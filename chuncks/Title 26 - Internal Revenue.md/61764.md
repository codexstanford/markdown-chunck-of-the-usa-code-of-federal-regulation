# Title 26 - Internal Revenue
## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 16A - TEMPORARY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PARTIAL EXCLUSION FOR CERTAIN CONSERVATION COST-SHARING PAYMENTS
##### ยง 16A.1255-1 General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of section 126 property.
###### Relation of section 1255 to other provisions,General.

(c)-(1)The provisions of section 1255 apply notwithstanding any other provisions of Subtitle A of the Code except that they do not apply to the extent gain is recognized as ordinary income under the other provisions of Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or limitation under ยง 16A.1255-2 applies, gain under section 1255(a)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1255 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section 1255 upon a disposition of section 126 property will be treated as ordinary income and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property to which section 1231 applies. See example (1) of paragraph (d) of this section.
