###### ยง 1.6038B-2 Reporting of certain transfers to foreign partnerships.
####### Time for filing Form 8865.

(5)The Form 8865 on which a transfer is reported must be attached to the transferor's timely filed (including extensions) income tax return for the tax year that includes the date of the transfer. If the person required to report under this section is not required to file an income tax return for its tax year during which the transfer occurred, but is required to file an information return for that year (for example, Form 1065, "U.S. Partnership Return of Income," or Form 990, "Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax"), the person should attach the Form 8865 to its information return.
