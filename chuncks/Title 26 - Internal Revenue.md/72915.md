####### ยง 301.6223(b)-1 Notice group.
######## Notice group is not a 5-percent group.

(e)The forming of a notice group under this section does not constitute the forming of a 5-percent group for purposes of litigation. A notice group is formed solely for the purpose of receiving notices. A 5-percent group is formed solely for the purpose of filing a petition for judicial review or appealing a judicial determination. See ยง 301.6226(b)-1. Thus, a member of a notice group may choose not to join a 5-percent group formed by other members of the notice group.
