####### Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (A.I.W.W.).

(6)Two inland water routes approximately paralleling the Atlantic coast between Norfolk, Virginia, and Miami, Florida, for 1,192 miles via both the Albermarle and Chesapeake Canal and Great Dismal Swamp Canal routes. For vessels traveling along the A.I.W.W. no matter how short the distance, the A.I.W.W. includes the main channel, all alternate channels, and all adjoining bays and sounds, regardless of depth. However, vessels merely crossing the A.I.W.W. on route either to a coastal port or to a nonspecified waterway will not be treated as traveling on the A.I.W.W.
