####### Computation of over-all 5 percent limitation,In general.

(b)-(1)The limitation prescribed by section 4216(e)(2) (the "over-all 5 percent limitation" referred to in paragraph (a) of this section) as to the total of the exclusions from price and readjustments of price which may be claimed for local advertising in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code shall be computed as of the close of each calendar quarter of the calendar year. The over-all 5 percent limitation is 5 percent of the difference between (i) the amount which would constitute the total taxable price (computed at the time of sale) of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code sold by the manufacturer during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and (ii) the total of all amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising of such articles (whatever the amount of any single charge of the total of all charges). In making the computations under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, credits or refunds under section 6416(b) of tax paid on the sale of any such articles are to be disregarded and articles sold tax-free by the manufacturer are to be excluded. The amount by which the over-all 5 percent limitation computed as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under the same section of the Code exceeds the sum of the charges for local advertising excluded in computing the taxable price and the amount of reimbursements for local advertising of such articles made during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, in respect of which credit or refund has been claimed, represents the unused portion of the over-all 5 percent limitation. Such unused portion is the maximum amount of reimbursements for local advertising in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed at the close of the particular calendar quarter, subject to the applicable conditions and limitations governing the right to claim a credit or refund in respect of local advertising (see ยง 48.6416(b)-1). The unused portion of the over-all 5 percent limitation as of the close of the fourth calendar quarter of a calendar year in respect of which credit or refund may not be claimed as of the close of such quarter must be disregarded in computing the over-all 5 percent limitation for any subsequent calendar quarter. Moreover, the amount of any reimbursements for local advertising made by a manufacturer in a calendar year which is in excess of the amount of such reimbursements in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed, within the over-all limitation, as of the close of the calendar year, may not subsequently serve as the basis for a credit or refund.
