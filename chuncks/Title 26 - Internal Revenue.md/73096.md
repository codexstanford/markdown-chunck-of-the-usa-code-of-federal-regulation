######## Example 3.

(3)The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year. Partnership has two equal partners during its entire 2019 taxable year: an individual, A, and a partnership-partner, B. During all of 2019, B has two equal partners: a tax-exempt entity, C, and an individual, D. The IRS mails a NOPPA to Partnership for its 2019 taxable year proposing a single partnership adjustment increasing Partnership's ordinary income by $100, resulting in a $40 imputed underpayment ($100 total netted partnership adjustment multiplied by 40 percent). Partnership timely requests modification under paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to B's partner, C, a tax-exempt entity. In accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, Partnership's partnership representative provides the IRS with documentation substantiating to the IRS's satisfaction that C held a 25 percent indirect interest in Partnership through its interest in B during the 2019 taxable year, that C was a tax-exempt entity defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section during the 2019 taxable year, and that C was not subject to tax with respect to its entire allocable share of the partnership adjustment allocated to B (which is $25 (50 percent x 50 percent x $100)). The IRS approves the modification and, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $25 increase in ordinary income allocated to C, through B, is not included in the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment (determined in accordance with ยง 301.6225-1). Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment is reduced to $75 ($100 adjustment less C's share of the adjustment, $25), and the imputed underpayment is reduced to $30 (total netted partnership adjustment of $75, after modification, multiplied by 40 percent).
