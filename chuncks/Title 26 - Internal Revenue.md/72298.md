####### ยง 301.6104(a)-4 Requirement for 26 or more plan participants.
######## Determining number of plan participants,In general.

(b)-(1)For purposes of determining whether a plan has fewer than 26 participants, the number of plan participants will be the number indicated on the most recent annual return filed for the plan under section 6058. Where an annual return indicates the number of participants both at the beginning and end of the plan year, the number indicated on the return means the number at the end of the plan year. If no annual return has been filed for the plan, then the number of plan participants will be the number indicated on the most recent application for a determination letter filed for the plan. If, however, the number of plan participants is increased prior to final Internal Revenue Service action on the application, the number of plan participants will be that increased number.
