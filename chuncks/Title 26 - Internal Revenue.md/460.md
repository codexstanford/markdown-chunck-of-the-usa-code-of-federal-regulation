() Although M is not eligible for affordable employer coverage under K's employer's coverage, paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section dictates that L's employer coverage must be evaluated to determine whether L's employer coverage is affordable for M. Under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section, L's employer's coverage is affordable for M, because L's required contribution for K, L, and M does not exceed the required contribution percentage of K's and L's household income. Accordingly, M is eligible for minimum essential coverage for all months in 2023.
