The term also includes any manufactured home which has a minimum of 400 square feet of living space and a minimum width in excess of 102 inches and which is of a kind customarily used at a fixed location. The preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes of determining the average area purchase price for single-family residences, nor shall it apply for purposes of determining the State ceiling amount. The term "residence" does not, however, include recreational vehicles, campers, and other similar vehicles.
