(B)-()Because FC1 owns an interest in PRS during FC1's CFC inclusion year and receives a distributive share of partnership items of the partnership under section 706(d), FC1 has partnership QBAI with respect to PRS in the amount determined under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, FC1's partner adjusted basis in Asset G is $25x, the product of $100x (the partnership's adjusted basis in the property) and 25% (FC1's section 704(b) distributive share of depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G).
