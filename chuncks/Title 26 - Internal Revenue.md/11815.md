####### Example 8.,Example 7

(viii)(A) Assume the same facts as inof paragraph (d)(4)(vii) of this section, except that F aggregates Business X, Business Y, and Business Z under the rules of ยง 1.199A-4.

(B) Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. Because the businesses are aggregated, these limitations are applied on an aggregated basis. None of the businesses holds qualified property, therefore only the W-2 wage limitation must be calculated. F applies the limitation by determining the lesser of 20% of the QBI from the aggregated businesses, which is $400,400 ($2,002,000 x 20%) and 50% of W-2 wages from the aggregated businesses, which is $500,000 ($1,000,000 x 50%). F's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of $400,400 and 20% of F's taxable income ($2,722,000 x 20% = $544,400). Thus, F's section 199A deduction for 2018 is $400,400.
