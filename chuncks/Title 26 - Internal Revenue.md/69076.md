####### 2,Conclusion.

()Employee A has a base amount of $600,000 ($200,000 + $400,000). The two $1 million payments are parachute payments because their aggregate present value is at least 3-times Employee A's base amount (3 x $600,000 = $1.8 million). The portion of the base amount allocated to each parachute payment is $300,000 (($1 million/$2 million) x $600,000). Thus, the amount of each excess parachute payment is $700,000 ($1 million-$300,000).
