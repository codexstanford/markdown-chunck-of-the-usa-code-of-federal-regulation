####### Example 2: Distribution for foreign law purposes,Facts.

(3)-(i)As of December 31, Year 1, CFC has $800x of section 951A PTEP (as defined in ยง 1.960-3(c)(2)(viii)) in a single annual PTEP account (as defined in ยง 1.960-3(c)(1)), and $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). On December 31, Year 1, CFC distributes $1,000x of its stock to USP. For Country A tax purposes, the entire $1,000x stock distribution is treated as a dividend to USP and is therefore a foreign dividend amount (as defined in ยง 1.861-20(b)). Country A imposes a withholding tax on USP of $150x with respect to the $1,000x of foreign gross dividend income that USP includes under Country A law. For Federal income tax purposes, USP does not recognize gross income as a result of the stock distribution under section 305(a). The $1,000x stock distribution is therefore a foreign law distribution.
