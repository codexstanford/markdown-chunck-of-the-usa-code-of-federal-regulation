###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Analysis.

(ii)B's acquisition of Equipment #2 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement as a result of the Group Prior Use Rule. Pursuant to the Group Prior Use Rule, B is treated as previously having a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 because B is a member of the Parent group and S, while a member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 within the lookback period. Thus, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #2 in 2019. The result would be the same if, after selling Equipment #2 to G, S had ceased to be a member of the Parent group prior to B's acquisition of Equipment #2.
