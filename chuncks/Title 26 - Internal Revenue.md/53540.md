####### Analysis,Application of the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule.

(ii)-(A)B was a member of the Parent group when it acquired Equipment #5. Because S, another member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #5 while a member of the group within the lookback period, B would be treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #5 under the Group Prior Use Rule and B's acquisition of Equipment #5 would not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. However, B's acquisition of Equipment #5 satisfies the requirements of the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. First, B's acquisition of Equipment #5 meets the requirements of ยง 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A) without regard to the related-party tests under section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and ยง 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii) or the Group Prior Use Rule. Second, as part of the same series of related transactions that includes B's acquisition of Equipment #5, B ceases to be a member of the Parent group and ceases to be Related to S. Third, Equipment #5 continues to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date (June 1, 2019).
