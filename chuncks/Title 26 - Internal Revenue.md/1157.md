(3)-(i)Assume the same facts asof paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that the income for the tenant residing in Unit #5 has declined so that tenant's income does not exceed 60 percent of AMGI. For Year 2, taxpayer timely redesignates Unit #5 pursuant to the rule in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section so that the imputed income limitation is 60 percent of AMGI instead of 80 percent of AMGI. Taxpayer also makes revisions so that Unit #5 is rent-restricted under the redesignated imputed income limitation. Taxpayer identifies 9 units (Units ##1-5 and 7-10) as the qualified group of units that are to be used for the set-aside requirement and the applicable fraction determination.
