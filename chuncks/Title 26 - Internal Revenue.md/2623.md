####### Termination of employment.

(3)(i) If employment of a WIN employee described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph is terminated by the transferee, the employment of such employee shall be deemed terminated by the taxpayer for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3. For purposes of determining the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 with respect to such taxpayer employment by the transferee shall be deemed employment by the transferor.

(ii) If in any taxable year the taxpayer does not retain a substantial ownership interest in the trade or business directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided that such other entities' bases in such interest are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the taxpayer) then, for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3, there shall be deemed to be a termination of employment of the WIN employees described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph on the first date on which such taxpayer does not retain a substantial interest in the trade or business. For purposes of determining the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3, employment by the transferee shall be deemed employment by the transferor. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in a trade or business under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in such trade or business after any such transfer or transfers.

(iii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in the case of a mere change in the form of a trade or business, if the interest of a taxpayer in the trade or business is reduced but such taxpayer has retained a substantial interest in such trade or business, paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.50A-5 (relating to electing small business corporations), paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.50A-6 (relating to estates or trusts), or paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1.50A-7 (relating to partnerships) shall apply, as the case may be.
