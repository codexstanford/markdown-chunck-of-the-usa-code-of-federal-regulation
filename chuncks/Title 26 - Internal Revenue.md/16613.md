(3)-(i)Old target may make an irrevocable election to apply the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846) in whole, but not in part, to a qualified stock purchase occurring before April 10, 2006 for which a section 338 election is made, provided that old target's taxable year that includes the deemed sale tax consequences and all subsequent affected taxable years are years for which an assessment of deficiency or a refund for overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of law. In the case of a section 338 election for which a section 338(h)(10) election is made (or a section 338 election for a foreign target), old target may make the election to apply the regulations retroactively without regard to whether new target makes the election. In the case of a section 338 election for a domestic target for which no section 338(h)(10) election is made, old target may make the election to apply the regulations retroactively only if new target also makes the election. Paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section prescribes the time and manner of the election for old target.
