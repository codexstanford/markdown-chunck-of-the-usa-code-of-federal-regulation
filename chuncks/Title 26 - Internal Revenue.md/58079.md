####### Accounting method changes.

(b)A taxpayer that changes its method of accounting with the consent of the Commissioner for the current taxable year must use the new method of accounting (as of the beginning of the taxable year) in the determination of taxable income for annualization periods ending on or after the date the related section 481(a) adjustment is treated as arising. See ยง 1.6655-2(f)(3)(ii)(C) for the date a section 481(a) adjustment is treated as arising. If the change in method of accounting does not result in a section 481(a) adjustment, the taxpayer may choose to use the new method of accounting (as of the beginning of the taxable year) in the determination of taxable income for all annualization periods during the year of change or only those annualization periods ending on or after the date the Form 3115 "Application for Change in Accounting Method" was filed with the national office of the Internal Revenue Service. This paragraph (b) only applies to the extent a taxpayer changes a method of accounting for the taxable year with the consent of the Commissioner. Therefore, a taxpayer may be subject to a section 6655 addition to tax for an underpayment of estimated tax if an underpayment results from a change in a method of accounting the taxpayer anticipates making for the taxable year but for which the consent of the Commissioner is not subsequently received.
