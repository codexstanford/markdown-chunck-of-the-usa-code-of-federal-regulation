####### Example 18: Rewards,Facts.

(xviii)-(A)On December 31, 2021, U, in the business of selling consumer electronics, sells a new TV for $1,000 and gives the customer 50 reward points. Each reward point is redeemable for a $1 discount on any future purchase of U's products. The reward points are not redeemable for cash and have a 2-year expiration date. U tracks the issue date, redemption date, and expiration date of each customer's reward points. Under the terms of U's reward program, when the customer redeems reward points they are deemed to use the earliest issued points first. In its AFS, U treats the rewards points as a separate performance obligation and allocates $50 of the $1,000 sales price to the rewards points. U is able to determine the extent to which a payment that is allocated to a reward point is taken into account in AFS revenue in the year of receipt. U does not take any of the amount allocated to the reward points into account as AFS revenue for 2021. U takes into account $25 of the reward points as AFS revenue for 2022 and $25 of the reward points as AFS revenue for 2023.
