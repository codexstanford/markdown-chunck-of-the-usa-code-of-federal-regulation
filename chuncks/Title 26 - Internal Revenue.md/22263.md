###### ยง 1.414(q)-1T Highly compensated employee (temporary).
####### Deemed resumption of employment.

(b)An employee who is treated as having a deemed separation year by reason of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this A-5 will not be treated as a highly compensated former employee (by reason of such deemed separation year) after such employee actually separates from service with the employer if, after such deemed separation year, and before the year of actual separation, such employee's services for and compensation from the employer for a determination year increase significantly so that such employee is treated as having a deemed resumption of employment. The determination of whether an employee who has incurred a deemed separation year has an increase in services and compensation sufficient to result in a deemed resumption of employment will be made on the basis of all the surrounding facts and circumstances pertaining to each individual case. At a minimum, there must be an increase in compensation from the employer to the extent that such compensation would not result in a deemed separation year under the tests in paragraph (a)(2) of this A-5 using the same three-year period taken into account in such paragraph.
