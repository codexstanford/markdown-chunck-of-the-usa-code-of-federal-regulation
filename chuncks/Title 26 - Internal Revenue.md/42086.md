() Under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)() of this section, for purposes of the separate foreign tax credit limitation under section 904, foreign source general category income for the taxable year is computed without taking into account the $37.5x of the deferred amount that is attributable to the deductions allocated and apportioned to the foreign source general category. Therefore, for the 2017 taxable year, foreign source general category income is $12.5x ($100x section 965(a) inclusion + $50x section 78 dividends-($175x deductions-$37.5x deferred amount). The remaining taxable income of $67.5x is U.S. source income.
