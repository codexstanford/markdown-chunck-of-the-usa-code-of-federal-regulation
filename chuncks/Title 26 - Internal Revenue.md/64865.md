###### ยง 31.3406(b)(3)-2 Reportable barter exchanges and gross proceeds of sales of securities or commodities by brokers.
####### Security short sales,Amount subject to backup withholding.

(4)-(i)The amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a short sale of securities is the gross proceeds (as defined in ยง 1.6045-1(d)(5) of this chapter) of the short sale. At the option of the broker, however, the amount subject to withholding may be the gain upon the closing of the short sale (if any); consequently, the obligation to withhold under section 3406 would be deferred until the closing transaction. A broker may use this alternative method of determining the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a short sale only if at the time the short sale is initiated, the broker expects that the amount of gain realized upon the closing of the short sale will be determinable from the broker's records. If, due to events unforeseen at the time the short sale was initiated, the broker is unable to determine the basis of the property used to close the short sale, the property must be assumed for this purpose to have a basis of zero.
