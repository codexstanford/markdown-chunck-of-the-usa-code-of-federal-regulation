()Solely for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A), Company N is treated as not engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business with respect to the leased office building. Company N leases the building to tenant X under a triple-net-lease, and therefore the employees of Company N do not meaningfully participate in the management or operations of the building. The fact that Company N maintains an office in the leased building with staff members to address any issues that may arise with respect to the triple-net-lease does not alter this result. Therefore, Company N does not conduct an active trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone.
