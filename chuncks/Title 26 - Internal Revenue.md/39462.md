####### A. 1:

Intangible property income will be allocated to the possessions corporation's U.S. shareholders with the proration of income based on shareholdings. If a shareholder of the possessions corporation is a foreign person or a tax-exempt person, the possessions corporation will be taxable on that shareholder's pro rata amount of the intangible property income. If any class of the stock of a possessions corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market, then the intangible property income will be taxable to the possessions corporation rather than the corporation's U.S. shareholders. For these purposes, a United States shareholder includes any shareholder who is a United States person as described under section 7701(a)(30). The term "intangible property income" means the gross income of a possessions corporation attributable to any intangible property other than intangible property which has been licensed to such corporation since prior to 1948 and which was in use by such corporation on September 3, 1982.
