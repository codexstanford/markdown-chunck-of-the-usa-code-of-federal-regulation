####### Example 2.

(2)Assume the facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (Example 1) except that A had been employed by the employer prior to April 20, 2021, and had furnished the employer a withholding allowance certificate prior to furnishing the withholding allowance certificate including the certifications described in paragraph (a) of this section on April 20, 2021. Under § 31.3402(f)(3)-1(b), the employer would be required to give effect to the new withholding allowance certificate no later than the beginning of the first payroll period ending (or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period) on or after May 20, 2021. However, under § 31.3402(f)(3)-1(b), the employer could, if it chose, make the new withholding allowance certificate effective with respect to any payment of wages made on or after April 20, 2021, and before the effective date mandated by section 3402(f)(3)(B)(i) and § 31.3402(f)(3)-1(b). Under § 31.3402(f)(4)-1(b), unless A furnishes a new withholding allowance certificate including the certifications described in § 31.3402(n)-1(a) to A's employer, the employer is required to deduct and withhold upon payments of wages to A made after February 15, 2022.
