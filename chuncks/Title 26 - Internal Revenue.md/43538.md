###### ยง 1.994-2 Marginal costing rules.
####### Application of limitation on DISC income ("no loss" rule).

(d)If the marginal costing rules of this section are applied, the combined taxable income method of ยง 1.994-1(c)(3) may not be applied to cause in any taxable year a loss to the related supplier, but such method may be applied to the extent it does not cause a loss. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a loss to a related supplier would result if the taxable income of the DISC would exceed the combined taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. If, however, there is no combined taxable income (so determined), see the last sentence of ยง 1.994-1(e)(1)(i).
