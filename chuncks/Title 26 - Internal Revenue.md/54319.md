(ii)Because the interest expense on P's third-party loan is not reflected on the books and records of DE1, no portion of such expense is attributable to P's interest in DE1pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-5(c)(3) for purposes of calculating the year 1 dual consolidated loss, if any, attributable to such interest. In addition, even though P's interest in DE1is treated as a separate domestic corporation for purposes of determining the amount of income or dual consolidated loss attributable to it pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-5(c)(1)(ii), such treatment does not cause the interest expense incurred on the loan from P to DE1that is generally disregarded for U.S. tax purposes to be regarded for purposes of calculating the year 1 dual consolidated loss, if any, attributable to P's interest in DE1. As a result, even though the disregarded interest expense is reflected on the books and records of DE1, it is not taken into account for purposes of calculating income or a dual consolidated loss. Therefore, there is no dual consolidated loss attributable to P's interest in DE1in year 1.
