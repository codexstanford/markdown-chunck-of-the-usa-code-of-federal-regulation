###### ยง 1.642(c)-2 Unlimited deduction for amounts permanently set aside for a charitable purpose.
####### Effective dates.

(e)Generally, the second sentence of paragraph (c) of this section, concerning the loss of any charitable deduction for long-term capital gains if the fund's income may be determined by a fixed percentage of the fair market value of the fund's assets or by any amount that takes into account unrealized appreciation in the value of the fund's assets, applies for taxable years beginning after January 2, 2004. In a state whose statute permits income to be determined by reference to a fixed percentage of, or the unrealized appreciation in, the value of the fund's assets, net long-term capital gain of a pooled income fund may be considered to be permanently set aside for charitable purposes if the fund's governing instrument is amended or reformed to eliminate the possibility of determining income in such a manner and if income has not been determined in this manner. For this purpose, a judicial proceeding to reform the fund's governing instrument must be commenced, or a nonjudicial reformation that is valid under state law must be completed, by the date that is nine months after the later of January 2, 2004 or the effective date of the state statute authorizing determination of income in such a manner.
