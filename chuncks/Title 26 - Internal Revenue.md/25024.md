####### Established securities market.

(4)For purposes of this paragraph, the term established securities market includes (i) a national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f), (ii) an exchange which is exempted from registration under section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 78e) because of its limited volume of transactions, and (iii) any over-the-counter market. For purposes of this subparagraph, an over-the-counter market is reflected by the existence of an interdealer quotation system. An interdealer quotation system is any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers which regularly disseminates quotations of obligations by identified brokers or dealers, other than a quotation sheet prepared and distributed by a broker or dealer in the regular course of his business and containing only quotations of such broker or dealer.
