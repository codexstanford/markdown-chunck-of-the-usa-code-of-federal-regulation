####### Liabilities arising under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.

(h)Notwithstanding the principles of paragraph (d) of this section, economic performance with respect to the liability of an owner or generator of nuclear waste to make payments to the Department of Energy ("DOE") pursuant to a contract required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-425, 42 U.S.C. 10101-10226 (1982)) occurs as each payment under the contract is made to DOE and not when DOE satisfies its obligations under the contract. This rule applies to the continuing fee required by 42 U.S.C. 10222(a)(2) (1982), as well as the one-time fee required by 42 U.S.C. 10222 (a)(3) (1982). For rules relating to when economic performance occurs with respect to interest, see paragraph (e) of this section.
