####### 2,Material misrepresentations and omissions.,1

()If the Commissioner determines that an agreement filed by an eligible section 965(i) transferor and an eligible section 965(i) transferee contains a material misrepresentation or material omission, or if the eligible section 965(i) transferee does not provide the additional information requested under paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(C)() of this section within a reasonable timeframe communicated by the Commissioner to the eligible section 965(i) transferee, then the Commissioner may reject the transfer agreement (effective as of the date of the related triggering event). In the alternative, on the date that the Commissioner determines that the transfer agreement includes a material misrepresentation or material omission, the Commissioner may determine that a triggering event has occurred with respect to the eligible section 965(i) transferee as of the date of the determination, such that the unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability of the eligible section 965(i) transferor that was assumed by the eligible section 965(i) transferee becomes due on the date of the determination.
