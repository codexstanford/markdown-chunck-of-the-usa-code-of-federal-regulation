####### Step one: Determine the fixed rate substitute for each variable rate provided under the debt instrument,Qualified floating rate.

(i)-(A)The fixed rate substitute for each qualified floating rate provided for in the debt instrument is the value of each rate as of the issue date. If, however, a variable rate debt instrument provides for two or more qualified floating rates with different intervals between interest adjustment dates, the fixed rate substitutes for the rates must be based on intervals that are equal in length. For example, if a 4-year debt instrument provides for 24 monthly interest payments based on the value of the 30-day commercial paper rate on each payment date followed by 8 quarterly interest payments based on the value of quarterly LIBOR on each payment date, the fixed rate substitutes may be based on the values, as of the issue date, of the 90-day commercial paper rate and quarterly LIBOR. Alternatively, the fixed rate substitutes may be based on the values, as of the issue date, of the 30-day commercial paper rate and monthly LIBOR.
