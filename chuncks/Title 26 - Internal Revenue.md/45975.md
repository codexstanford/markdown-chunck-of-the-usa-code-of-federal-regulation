####### Certain gifts,In general.

(4)-(i)If farm recapture property is transferred as a gift by a spouse to a person other than a spouse during a taxable year for which a joint return is filed, the spouses shall for purposes of applying the provisions of section 1251(b) (5) (B) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section be treated as a single taxpayer. Thus, under paragraph (e)(2) of ยง 1.1251-2, the potential gain limitation percentage and the proportion for allocating the amount in the joint excess deductions account to one or more donees shall be determined by treating the spouses as a single taxpayer. However, with respect to each gift by a spouse, such spouse's separately maintained excess deductions account shall be reduced (below zero, if necessary) by the amount of the joint excess deductions account balance to which the donee of such gift succeeded under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section.
