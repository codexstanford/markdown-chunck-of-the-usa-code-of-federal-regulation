(B)-()In addition to the general requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(B)(), through () of this section, a beneficial owner withholding certificate provided by an account holder to document an account that is maintained at a U.S. branch or office of a withholding agent that is a financial institution is valid for purposes of a payment of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (before the application of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)) made on or after January 1, 2018, only if it contains the account holder's taxpayer identification number issued by the account holder's jurisdiction of tax residence (foreign TIN) or a reasonable explanation for the absence of a foreign TIN (as described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)() of this section) and, in the case of an individual account holder, the account holder's date of birth, unless the withholding agent has the account holder's date of birth in its files. A withholding agent is permitted to obtain a foreign TIN on a written statement signed by an account holder that includes an acknowledgment that such statement is part of the withholding certificate if the withholding agent associates such statement with the account holder's withholding certificate. A withholding agent will be treated as having the account holder's date of birth in its files if it obtains the date of birth on a written statement (including a written statement transmitted by email) from the account holder. A withholding agent may rely on the foreign TIN and date of birth contained in the withholding certificate unless it knows or has reason to know that the foreign TIN or date of birth is incorrect. Therefore, a withholding agent will not be required to validate the format or other specifications of the foreign TIN against the applicable jurisdiction's TIN system. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B), a change of address to another jurisdiction other than the United States is a change in circumstances for purposes of a withholding agent's reliance on a foreign TIN of the account holder (or reasonable explanation for its absence).
