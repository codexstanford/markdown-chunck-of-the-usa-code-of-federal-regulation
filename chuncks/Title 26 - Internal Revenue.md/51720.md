(D) The name, address, and GIIN of the NFFE; and

(E) Any other information as required by Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and its accompanying instructions;

(iii) The NFFE must obtain a written certification (contained on a withholding certificate or in a written statement) from each person that would be treated as a substantial U.S. owner of the NFFE if such person were a specified U.S. person. Such written certification must indicate whether the person is a substantial U.S. owner of the NFFE, and if so, the name, address and TIN of the person. If the NFFE has reason to know that such written certification is unreliable or incorrect, it must contact the person and request a revised written certification. If no revised written certification is received, the NFFE must treat the person as a substantial U.S. owner and report on Form 8966 the information required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The NFFE has reason to know that such a written certification is unreliable or incorrect if the certification is inconsistent with information in the NFFE's possession, including information that the NFFE provides to a financial institution in order for the financial institution to meet its AML or other account identification due diligence procedures with respect to the NFFE's account, information that is publicly available, or U.S. indicia as described in ยง 1.1441-7(b) for which appropriate documentation sufficient to cure the U.S. indicia in the manner set forth in ยง 1.1441-7(b)(8) has not been obtained;

(iv) The NFFE must keep records that it produces in the ordinary course of its business that summarize the activity (including the gross amounts described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section that are paid or credited to each of its substantial U.S. owners) relating to its transactions with respect to the equity of the NFFE held by each of its substantial U.S. owners for any calendar year in which the owner was required to be reported under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The records must be retained for the longer of six years or the retention period under the NFFE's normal business procedures. A NFFE may be required to extend the six year retention period if the IRS requests such an extension prior to the expiration of the six year period;

(v) The NFFE must respond to requests made by the IRS for additional information with respect to any substantial U.S. owner that is subject to reporting by the NFFE or with respect to the records described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section;

(vi) The NFFE must make a periodic certification to the IRS on or before July 1 of the calendar year following the end of each certification period relating to its compliance with respect to the election described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. The first certification period begins on the later of the date a GIIN is issued or June 30, 2014, and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following that date. Each subsequent certification period is the three calendar year period following the close of the previous certification period. The certification will require an officer of the NFFE to certify to the following statements-

(A)(1) The NFFE has not had any events of default described in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section; or

(2) If there are any events of default, appropriate measures were taken to remediate such failures and to prevent such failures from recurring; and

(B) With respect to any failure to report to the extent required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii), the NFFE has corrected such failure by filing the appropriate information returns; and

(vii) The NFFE has not had its status as a direct reporting NFFE revoked by the IRS.
