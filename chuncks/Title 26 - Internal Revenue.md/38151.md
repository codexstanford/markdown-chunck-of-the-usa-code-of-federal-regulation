###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Certain transfers of intangible property,1,In general.

(D)-()For purposes of applying this paragraph (f)(2)(vi), the amount of gross income attributable to a foreign branch (and the amount of gross income attributable to its foreign branch owner) must be adjusted under the principles of paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B) of this section to reflect all transactions that are disregarded for Federal income tax purposes in which property described in section 367(d)(4) is transferred to or from a foreign branch or between foreign branches, whether or not a disregarded payment is made in connection with the transfer. In determining the amount of gross income that is attributable to a foreign branch that must be adjusted by reason of this paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D), the principles of sections 367(d) and 482 apply. For example, if a foreign branch owner transfers property described in section 367(d)(4) to a foreign branch, the principles of section 367(d) are applied by treating the foreign branch as a separate foreign corporation to which the property is transferred in exchange for stock of the corporation in a transaction described in section 351. Similarly, if a foreign branch remits property described in section 367(d)(4) to its foreign branch owner, the foreign branch is treated as having sold the transferred property to the foreign branch owner in exchange for annual payments contingent on the productivity or use of the property, the amounts of which are determined under the principles of section 367(d).
