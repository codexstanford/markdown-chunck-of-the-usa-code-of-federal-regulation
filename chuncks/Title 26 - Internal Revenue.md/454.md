()The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)() of this section (Example 2), except that J works all year for an employer that offers employer-sponsored coverage to employees. J's required contribution for the cost of self-only coverage from J's employer does not exceed the required contribution percentage of C's and J's household income. Although the coverage offered by C's employer for C and J is unaffordable for J, the coverage offered by J's employer is affordable for J. Consequently, under paragraphs (c)(3)(v)(A)() and () of this section, J is eligible for minimum essential coverage for all months in 2023.
