###### ยง 1.381(c)(18)-1 Depletion on extraction of ores or minerals from the waste or residue of prior mining.
####### Carryover requirement.

(a)Section 381(c)(18) provides that the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) shall be considered as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for the purpose of determining the applicability of section 613(c)(3) (relating to extraction of ores or minerals from the ground). Thus, an acquiring corporation which has acquired the waste or residue of prior mining from a distributor or transferor corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) shall be entitled, after the date of distribution or transfer, to an allowance for depletion under section 611 in respect of ores or minerals extracted from such waste or residue if the distributor or transferor corporation would have been entitled to such an allowance for depletion in the absence of the distribution or transfer. See paragraph (f) of ยง 1.613-4 to determine whether a distributor or transferor corporation is entitled to an allowance for depletion with respect to the waste or residue of prior mining.
