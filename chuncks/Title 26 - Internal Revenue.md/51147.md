####### Timeframe for applying identification and documentation procedure for entity accounts and payees.

(ii)For preexisting entity accounts (including entity accounts that are opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, that the FFI treats as preexisting obligations under § 1.1471-1(b)(104)(i)), a participating FFI must perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures within six months of the effective date of the FFI agreement for any account holder that is a prima facie FFI, as defined in § 1.1471-2(a)(4)(ii)(B), and within two years of the effective date of the FFI agreement for all other entity accounts, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. For accounts that are not preexisting accounts, the participating FFI must perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures by the earlier of the date a withholdable payment or a foreign passthru payment is made with respect to the account or within 90 days of the date the participating FFI opens the account. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), with respect to a preexisting obligation issued in nonregistered (bearer) form by an investment entity, the investment entity is required to perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures at the time a payment is collected by the beneficial owner of the payment (including a beneficial owner that collects the payment through an intermediary or agent). If the participating FFI cannot obtain all the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d) or if the participating FFI knows or has reason to know that the documentation provided for an entity account is unreliable or incorrect (by applying the standards of knowledge applicable to entities in § 1.1471-3(e) as modified by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)), the participating FFI shall apply the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) (as applicable to entities) to determine the chapter 4 status of the account holder. In the case of an account held by a passive NFFE that provides the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d)(12) to establish its status as a passive NFFE but fails to provide the information regarding its owners, see § 1.1471-5(g)(2)(iv) for the requirement to treat the account as held by a recalcitrant account holder.
