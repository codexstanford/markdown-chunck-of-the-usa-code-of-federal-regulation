### Subchapter A - Income Tax

##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### ยง 1.163-7 Deduction for OID on certain debt instruments.
####### General rule.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an issuer (including a transferee) determines the amount of OID that is deductible each year under section 163(e)(1) by using the constant yield method described in ยง 1.1272-1(b). This determination, however, is made without regard to section 1272(a)(7) (relating to acquisition premium) and ยง 1.1273-1(d) (relating to de minimis OID). An issuer is permitted a deduction under section 163(e)(1) only to the extent the issuer is primarily liable on the debt instrument. For certain limitations on the deductibility of OID, see sections 163(e) and 1275(b)(2). To determine the amount of interest (OID) that is deductible each year on a debt instrument that provides for contingent payments, see ยง 1.1275-4.
