(ii)-(A)In the case of a plan established during the plan year that was not the result of a merger or spinoff, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage is equal to 100 percent for plan years before the plan was established. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, a plan that has a predecessor plan in accordance with ยง 1.415(f)-1(c) is not a plan established during the plan year under this paragraph (j)(5)(ii)(A). Instead, if the plan has a predecessor plan, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year is the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year for the predecessor plan (and that predecessor plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage is treated as equal to 100 percent on any date on which it is terminated, other than in a distress termination).
