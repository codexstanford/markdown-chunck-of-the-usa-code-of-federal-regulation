###### ยง 1.812-5 Offset.
####### Offset defined.

(a)Section 812(d) defines the term "offset" for purposes of section 812(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of ยง 1.812-4. For any taxable year the offset is only that portion of the increase in the operations loss deduction for the taxable year which is necessary to reduce the life insurance company taxable income (computed without regard to section 802(b)(3)) for such year to zero. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the offset shall be determined with the modifications prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Such modifications shall be made independently of, and without reference to, the modifications required by paragraph (a) of ยง 1.812-3 for purposes of computing the loss from operations itself.
