(c)-(1)A taxpayer may not make a special transfer to a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund unless the taxpayer requests from the IRS a schedule of deduction amounts in connection with such transfer. A schedule of deduction amounts for a nuclear decommissioning fund (schedule of deduction amounts) is a ruling (within the meaning of ยง 601.201(a)(2) of this chapter) specifying the annual deductions (deduction amounts) that, over the taxable years in the remaining useful life of the nuclear power plant, will result in the deduction of the entire amount of the special transfer. Such a request may be combined with a request for a schedule of ruling amounts under ยง 1.468A-3(a). In the case of a combined request, the schedule of deduction amounts requested under this paragraph (c)(1) must be stated separately from the schedule of ruling amounts requested under ยง 1.468A-3(a) and approval of the schedule of deduction amounts under this section will constitute a separate ruling. A request for a schedule of deduction amounts must comply with all provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
