()All of the rights and obligations under the intercompany obligation are extinguished in an intercompany transaction that is an exchange (or deemed exchange) for a newly issued intercompany obligation, and the issue price of the newly issued obligation equals both the adjusted issue price of the extinguished obligation and the creditor's basis in the extinguished obligation. Solely for purposes of the preceding sentence, a newly issued intercompany obligation includes an obligation that is issued (or deemed issued) by a member other than the original debtor if such other member assumes the original debtor's obligations under the original obligation in a transaction that is described in either paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)() or (g)(3)(i)(B)() of this section and the assumption results in a significant modification of the original obligation under ยง 1.1001-3(e)(4) and a deemed exchange under ยง 1.1001-3(b).
