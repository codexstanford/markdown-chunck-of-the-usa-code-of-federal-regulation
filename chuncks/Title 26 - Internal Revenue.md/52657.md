() In Year 4, the M group has $10 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 4). That consolidated taxable income would be $45 if determined by reference only to the items of P, S, and T, the members included in the SRLY subgroup with respect to P's loss carryover. Therefore, the positive balance of the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup for Year 4 equals $45 and, due to the application of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the SRLY subgroup limitation under this paragraph (c)(2) is $36 ($45 x 80 percent). However, the M group has only $10 of consolidated taxable income in Year 4. Thus, due to the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the M group's deduction of all net operating losses in Year 4 is limited to $8 ($10 x 80 percent). As a result, the M group deducts $8 of P's SRLY net operating loss carryover, and the remaining $37 is carried over to Year 5.
