####### Exception for certain advance premiums.

(iii)If an insurance company receives a portion of the gross premium for an insurance contract prior to the first day of the taxable year that includes the effective date of the contract, the company may report the advance premium (rather than the full amount of the gross premium for the contract) in gross premiums written for the taxable year in which the advance premium is received. An insurance company may adopt this method of reporting advance premiums only if the company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses for the taxable year in which the company receives the advance premium does not exceed the limitation of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section. A company that reports an advance premium in gross premiums written under this paragraph (a)(5)(iii) takes into account the remainder of the gross premium written and premium acquisition expenses for the contract in the taxable year that includes the effective date of the contract. A company that adopts this method of reporting advance premiums must use the method for all contracts with advance premiums.
