####### Third party repositories.,1

(E)A withholding certificate will be considered furnished for purposes of this section (including paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A)() of this section) by the person providing the certificate, and a withholding agent may rely on an otherwise valid withholding certificate received electronically from a third party repository, if the withholding certificate was uploaded or provided to a third party repository and there are processes in place to ensure that the withholding certificate can be reliably associated with a specific request from the withholding agent and a specific authorization from the person providing the certificate (or an agent of the person providing the certificate) for the withholding agent making the request to receive the withholding certificate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a withholding agent must be able to reliably associate each payment with a specific request and authorization except when the withholding agent is permitted to rely on the withholding certificate on an obligation-by- obligation basis or as otherwise permitted under paragraph (e)(4)(ix) of this section (treating the withholding certificate as obtained by the withholding agent and furnished by a customer for purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(E)). A third party repository may also be used for withholding statements, and a withholding agent may also rely on an otherwise valid withholding statement, if the intermediary providing the withholding certificates and withholding statement through the repository provides an updated withholding statement in the event of any change in the information previously provided (for example, a change in the composition of a partnership or a change in the allocation of payments to the partners) and ensures there are processes in place to update withholding agents when there is a new withholding statement (and withholding certificates, as necessary) in the event of any change that would affect the validity of the prior withholding certificates or withholding statement. A third party repository, for purposes of this paragraph, is an entity that maintains withholding certificates (including certificates accompanied by withholding statements) but is not an agent of the applicable withholding agent or the person providing the certificate.
