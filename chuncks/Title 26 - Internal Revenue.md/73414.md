####### ยง 301.6231(e)-1 Effect of a determination with respect to a nonpartnership item on the determination of a partnership item.
######## In general.

(a)The determination of an item after it has become a nonpartnership item with respect to a partner is not controlling in the determination of that item with respect to other partners. Thus, for example, the determination by a court in a separate proceeding relating to a partner that a certain partnership expenditure was deductible does not bind either the Internal Revenue Service or the other partners in a later partnership or other proceeding.
