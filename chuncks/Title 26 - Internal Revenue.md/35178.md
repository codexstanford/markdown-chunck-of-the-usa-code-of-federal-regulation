####### Apportionment based on gross receipts.

(3)In applying the remaining apportionment under paragraph (d) of this section, if a taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that incurs R&E expenditures described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the taxpayer is not reasonably expected to license, sell, or transfer to the partnership (directly or indirectly) intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R&E expenditures, in the manner described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, then the taxpayer's gross receipts in a SIC code category include only the taxpayer's share of any gross receipts in the SIC code category of the partnership. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxpayer's share of gross receipts is proportionate to the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's gross income in the product category. However, if the taxpayer is reasonably expected to license, sell, or transfer to the partnership (directly or indirectly) intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer current R&E expenditures, in the manner described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, then the taxpayer's gross receipts in a SIC code category include the full amount of any gross receipts in the SIC code category of the partnership as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section.
