(1) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins before January 1, 1962, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for its first 2 taxable years which begin after the date of such distribution or transfer, take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and in the immediately preceding taxable year;

(2) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for certain taxable years which begin after the date of distribution or transfer, take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year ending on such date of distribution or transfer and in any of the four taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year but excluding any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962 (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
