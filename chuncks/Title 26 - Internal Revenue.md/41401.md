() Under ยง 1.951A-1(e)(1), for purposes of determining the GILTI inclusion amount of US1 and US2, PRS is not treated as owning (within the meaning of section 958(a)) the stock of CFC1; instead, PRS is treated in the same manner as a foreign partnership for purposes of determining the stock of CFC1 owned by US1 and US2 under section 958(a)(2). Therefore, only US1 is a United States shareholder of CFC1. Taking into account both CFC1 and CFC2, US1 has a GILTI inclusion amount in the general category of $485x, and an aggregate amount described in section 951A(c)(1)(A) and ยง 1.951A-1(c)(2)(i) within the general category of $485x. 285u (95% x 300u) of the income in CFC1's tested income group and 200u of the income in CFC2's tested income group is included in computing US1's aggregate amount described in section 951A(c)(1)(A) and ยง 1.951A-1(c)(2)(i) within the general category. Because US2 is not a U.S. shareholder with respect to CFC1, US2 does not take into account CFC1's tested income in determining its GILTI inclusion amount.
