####### Proportionate share.

(4)A domestic corporation's or recipient controlled foreign corporation's proportionate share of the PTEP group taxes with respect to a PTEP group within a section 904 category is equal to the total amount of the PTEP group taxes with respect to the PTEP group multiplied by a fraction (not to exceed one), the numerator of which is the amount of the section 959 distribution from the PTEP group, and the denominator of which is the total amount of previously taxed earnings and profits in the PTEP group, both determined in the functional currency of the controlled foreign corporation.
