####### Analysis.

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), M is required to include $480 in gross income in 2021 as M has a fixed right to receive $480 ($40 x 12) for the 12 months of media content licensed to Customer in 2021. M does not have a fixed right to receive any portion of the 2022 subscription fee as of the end of 2021 as such fee is not due under the terms of the subscription agreement until 2022 and M has yet to provide the media content for the 2022 subscription period. However, under the AFS income inclusion rule, because M has an enforceable right to recover all $960 of AFS revenue reported for 2021 if Customer were to terminate the contract at the end of 2021, all $960 is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" in 2021. Accordingly, M is required to include $960 in gross income in 2021.
