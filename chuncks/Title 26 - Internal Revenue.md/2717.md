####### Certifications issued to certain rehires.

(8)This paragraph (d)(8) applies in the case of an employee who first began work for the employer before August 13, 1981, and was dismissed and rehired by the employer. A certification received or requested by an employer with respect to such an employee will be considered timely only if there was a valid business reason, unrelated to the availability of the credit, for the dismissal and rehire and if the employer did not dismiss and then rehire the employee in order to meet the timing requirement with respect to certification. An individual who is dismissed and then rehired for the purpose described in the preceding sentence will be considered for purposes of section 51(d)(16) and this paragraph to have been continuously employed by the employer during the time between the dismissal and the rehire. Whether the employer was motivated by reason of the certification rules in section 51(d)(16) and this paragraph to dismiss and then rehire an employee is a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances surrounding the dismissal and rehire. (See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for a separate rule disallowing the credit in the case of nonqualifying rehires.)
