####### Treatment of net long-term capital gains.

(b)For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962, any net long-term capital gains (as defined in section 1222(7)) from the sale or exchange of a capital asset (or any gain considered to be from the sale or exchange of a capital asset under applicable law) shall be excluded from the determination of gain or loss from operations of a life insurance company. On the other hand, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(6)) shall be taken into account in determining gain or loss from operations under section 809. However, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, the excess of net short-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(5)) over net long-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(8)) is included in computing investment yield (as defined in section 804(c)) and, to that extent, is taken into account in determining gain or loss from operations under section 809.
