####### Gift or deemed gift transfers,In general.

(9)-(i)A transfer statement for a security transferred to a different owner (other than a transfer that the transferor knows is pursuant to a lending or borrowing arrangement or is from a decedent or decedent's estate) must indicate that the security is a gift and must report the date of the gift (if known when furnishing the statement) and the fair market value of the gift on that date (if known or readily ascertainable at the time the transfer statement is prepared). The transfer statement must report the adjusted basis and original acquisition date of the security in the hands of the donor. However, if the transfer is between persons for whom gift-related basis adjustments are inapplicable or between accounts that share at least one common customer, the transferor must apply paragraph (b)(1) of this section as if the security were not a gift or deemed gift.
