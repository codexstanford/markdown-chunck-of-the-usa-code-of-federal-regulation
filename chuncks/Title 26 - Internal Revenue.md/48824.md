()The ownership and operation of the golf course at the QOF level will not disqualify the QOF because the prohibition on businesses described in section 144(c)(6)(B) is not applicable at the QOF level. In addition, if each requirement set forth in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D) is satisfied, the property used in the commercial golf course will qualify as qualified opportunity zone business property held by Entity B for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(A).
