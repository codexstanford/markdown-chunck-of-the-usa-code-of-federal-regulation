####### Assessment of tax.

(e)Any amount determined as a deficiency in the manner described in paragraph (d) of this section in respect of any taxable year of the five consecutive taxable years specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be assessed and collected as if on the date of the expiration of the period of limitation for the assessment of a deficiency for the fifth taxable year of such five consecutive taxable years, one year remained before the expiration of the period of limitation upon assessment for the taxable year in respect of which the deficiency is determined. If the taxable year is one in respect of which an assessment could be made without regard to section 270, the amount of the actual deficiency as defined in section 6211(a) (whether it is greater than, equal to, or less than the deficiency determined under section 270(c)) shall be assessed and collected. However, if the assessment of a deficiency for such taxable year would be prevented by any provision of law (e.g., the period of limitation upon the assessment of tax) except section 7122, or the corresponding provision of prior revenue laws, relating to compromises, or by the operation of any rule of law (e.g., res judicata), then the excess of the tax recomputed as described in paragraph (d) of this section over the tax previously determined may be assessed and collected even though in fact there is no actual deficiency, as defined in section 6211(a), in respect of the given taxable year.
