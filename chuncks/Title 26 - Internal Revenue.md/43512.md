####### Freight expenses,In general.

(4)-(i)Export promotion expenses include one-half of the freight expense (not including insurance) for shipping export property aboard a U.S.-flag carrier in those cases where law or regulation of the United States or of any State or political subdivision thereof or of any agency or instrumentality of any of these does not require that the export property be shipped aboard a U.S.-flag carrier. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "freight expense" includes charges paid for c.o.d. service, miscellaneous ground charges, such as charges incurred for services normally performed by U.S.-flag carriers, charges for services of loading aboard U.S.-flag carriers normally performed by such carriers, freight forwarders, or independent contractors engaged in loading property, and charges attributable to a freight consolidation function normally performed by freight forwarders. In order for one-half of freight expenses paid to the owner (or the agent of the owner) of a U.S.-flag carrier to be claimed as an export promotion expense, the DISC must obtain a written statement (such as, for example, a bill of lading) from the owner (or the agent) disclosing that the export property was shipped aboard the owner's U.S.-flag carrier or another U.S.-flag carrier, and the DISC must have no reasonable basis for disbelieving such statement of the owner (or the agent). For the requirement of a written statement from a freight forwarder, see subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.
