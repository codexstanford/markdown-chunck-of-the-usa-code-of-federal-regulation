(c)(1) Withholding at source in the case of dividends derived from sources within the United States and paid on or after January 1, 1957, to nonresident aliens (including a nonresident alien individual, fiduciary, and partnership) and to foreign corporations, whose addresses are in France, shall be at the rate of 15 percent in every case except that in which, prior to the date of payment of such dividends, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has notified the withholding agent that the reduced rate of withholding shall not apply.

(2) The preceding provisions respecting the application of the reduced withholding rate in the case of dividends paid to nonresident aliens and foreign corporations with addresses in France are based upon the assumption that the payee of the dividend is the actual owner of the capital stock from which the dividend is derived and consequently is the person liable to the United States upon such dividend. As to action by the recipient who is not the owner of the dividend, see § 514.3.

(3) The rate at which the United States tax has been withheld from any dividend paid at any time after the expiration of the thirtieth day after the date on which §§ 514.1 to 514.10 are published in theto any person whose address is in France at the time the dividend is paid shall be shown either in writing or by appropriate stamp on the check, draft, or other evidence of payment or on an accompanying statement.
