######## Example 2.

(ii)J was a partner in Partnership during 2018. In 2021, Partnership receives an FPA in an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. The FPA reflects an imputed underpayment. Partnership properly elects the application of section 6226 with respect to the imputed underpayment and files with the IRS and furnishes to J a statement of J's share of adjustments with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. J fails to report one adjustment reflected on the statement, J's share of a decrease in the amount of losses for 2018, on J's return as required by section 6226. The IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the decrease in the amount of losses on J's return to be consistent with the amount included on the section 6226 statement filed with the IRS and may assess the resulting underpayment in tax as if it were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on J's return. J may not request an abatement of that assessment under section 6213(b).
