####### Determination of holding period,In general.

(d)-(1)Special rules are provided by paragraph (3) of section 246(c) for determining the period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock for purposes of the restriction provided by such section. In computing the holding period the day of disposition but not the day of acquisition shall be taken into account. Also, there shall not be taken into account any day which is more than 15 days after the date on which the share of stock becomes ex-dividend. Thus, the holding period is automatically terminated at the end of such 15-day period without regard to how long the stock may be held after that date. In the case of stock qualifying under paragraph (2) of section 246(c) (as having preference in dividends) a 90-day period is substituted for the 15-day period prescribed in this subparagraph. Finally, section 1223(4), relating to holding periods in the case of wash sales, shall not apply. Therefore, tacking of the holding period of the stock disposed of to the holding period of the stock acquired where a wash sale occurs is not permitted for purposes of determining the holding period described in section 246(c).
