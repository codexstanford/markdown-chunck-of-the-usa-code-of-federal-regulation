####### ยง 301.6233(a)-1 Interest and penalties determined from reviewed year.
######## Example 3.,Example 2

(C)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section, except that there is also a negative adjustment to ordinary income of $50 that was subgrouped under ยง 301.6225-1 with the $100 positive adjustment to ordinary. Because the $50 negative adjustment to ordinary income was subgrouped under ยง 301.6225-1 with the $100 positive adjustment to ordinary income, in determining the portion of the imputed underpayment subject to penalty, the $50 negative adjustment is applied to offset part of the $100 positive adjustment to ordinary income ($100-$50 = $50). Accordingly, the portion of the imputed underpayment to which the 20-percent accuracy-related penalty applies is $30 (($50 x 40 percent) + $10), and the penalty is $6 ($30 x 20 percent).
