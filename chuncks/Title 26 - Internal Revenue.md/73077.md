####### ยง 301.6225-2 Modification of imputed underpayment.
######## Modification based on a rate of tax lower than the highest applicable tax rate.

(4)A partnership may request modification based on a lower rate of tax for the reviewed year with respect to adjustments that are attributable to a relevant partner that is a C corporation and adjustments with respect to capital gains or qualified dividends that are attributable to a relevant partner who is an individual. In no event may the lower rate determined under the preceding sentence be less than the highest rate in effect for the reviewed year with respect to the type of income and taxpayer. For instance, with respect to adjustments that are attributable to a C corporation, the highest rate in effect for the reviewed year with respect to all C corporations would apply to that adjustment, regardless of the rate that would apply to the C corporation based on the amount of that C corporation's taxable income. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), an S corporation is treated as an individual.
