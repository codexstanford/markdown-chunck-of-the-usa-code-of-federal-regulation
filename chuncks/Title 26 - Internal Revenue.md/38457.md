####### Safe harbor method,In general.

(ii)-(A)Subject to the rules of paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, a taxpayer may allocate the post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) under one of the safe harbor methods described in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(B) and (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. A taxpayer may choose to use the safe harbor method on a timely filed (original or amended) tax return or during an audit. A taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the safe harbor method to years that are not open for assessment. A taxpayer's choice to use the safe harbor method is evidenced by employing the method. The taxpayer need not file any separate statement.
