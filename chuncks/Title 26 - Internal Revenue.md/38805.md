###### § 1.905-3 Adjustments to U.S. tax liability and to current earnings and profits as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
####### ii,Result in Year 6.

()USC's payment of the Year 1 tax liability of 100u on March 15, Year 6, results in a second foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the additional tax is taken into account in Year 1, the year to which the redetermined tax relates, irrespective of when the tax is paid. Under § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), because the tax was paid more than 24 months after the close of the year to which the tax relates, USC must translate the 100u of tax at the spot rate on the date of payment of the foreign taxes in Year 6. If USC timely notifies the IRS, it may claim an increased foreign tax credit for Year 1. USC must also make corresponding adjustments in determining its taxable income and net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in Year 1. See §§ 1.987-3(c)(2)(v) and 1.987-4(d)(7).
