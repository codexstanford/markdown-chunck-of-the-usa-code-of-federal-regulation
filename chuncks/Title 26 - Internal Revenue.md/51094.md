####### Reason to know there are U.S. indicia associated with preexisting offshore obligations.

(C)For payments made outside of the United States with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation and with respect to a withholding agent that had not already documented the payee for purposes of chapter 3 or 61, the withholding agent, in lieu of searching the account files addressed in paragraph (e)(4)(vii)(A) of this section to determine whether there are U.S. indicia associated with the payee (or other person who receives the payment), may instead rely upon a search of its electronically searchable information associated with such person. A withholding agent that relies upon an electronic search pursuant to this paragraph (e)(4)(vii)(C) must also review for U.S. indicia any documentation upon which the withholding agent relies to determine the chapter 4 status of the person and any documentation that the withholding agent had been relying upon to determine the residency or citizenship of the person.
