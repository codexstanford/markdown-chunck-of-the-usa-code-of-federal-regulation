####### Contractually ensuring capture and disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide.

(2)In the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, a taxpayer is not required to physically carry out the capture and disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide to claim the section 45Q credit if the taxpayer contractually ensures in a binding written contract that the party that physically carries out the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide does so in the manner required under section 45Q, this section and §§ 1.45Q-2, 1.45Q-3, 1.45Q-4, and 1.45Q-5. A taxpayer may enter into a binding written contract with a general contractor that hires subcontractors to physically carry out the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide, but the contract must bind the subcontractors to the requirements of this paragraph (h)(2). In the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018, a taxpayer that contractually ensures the capture of the qualified carbon oxide is not eligible for the section 45Q credit. However, the taxpayer is not required to physically carry out the disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide to claim the section 45Q credit if the taxpayer contractually ensures in a binding written contract that the party that physically carries out the disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide does so in the manner required under section 45Q, this section, and §§ 1.45Q-2, 1.45Q-3, 1.45Q-4, and 1.45Q-5.
