()A withholding agent may also rely on documentation collected by an agent of the withholding agent in order to fulfill its chapter 3 obligations because such agent's actions are imputed to the principal (the withholding agent). For example, a withholding agent may contract an agent to collect Forms W-8 from account holders on its behalf, but the withholding agent remains liable for any tax liability resulting from a failure of the agent to comply with the requirements of chapter 3.
