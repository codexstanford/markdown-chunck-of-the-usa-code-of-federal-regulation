###### § 601.503 Requirements of power of attorney, signatures, fiduciaries and Commissioner's authority to substitute other requirements.
####### Special provision.

(3)The Internal Revenue Service will not accept a power of attorney which fails to include the information required by §§ 601.503(a)(1) through (5). If a power of attorney fails to include some or all of the information required by such section, the attorney-in-fact can cure this defect by executing a form 2848 (on behalf of the taxpayer) which includes the missing information. Attaching a form 2848 to a copy of the original power of attorney will validate the original power of attorney (and will be treated in all circumstances as one signed and filed by the taxpayer) provided the following conditions are satisfied-

(i) The original power of attorney contemplates authorization to handle, among other things, Federal tax matters, (e.g., the power of attorney includes language to the effect that the attorney-in-fact has the authority to perform any and all acts).

(ii) The attorney-in-fact attaches a statement (signed under penalty of perjury) to the form 2848 which states that the original power of attorney is valid under the laws of the governing jurisdiction.
