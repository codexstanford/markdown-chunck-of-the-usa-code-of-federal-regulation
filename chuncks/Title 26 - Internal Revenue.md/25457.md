####### 2,Election not to discount.

()Notwithstanding the general requirement to discount post-completion adjustments, a taxpayer may elect not to discount contract price and contract cost adjustments with respect to any contract. The election not to discount is to be made on a contract-by-contract basis and is binding with respect to all post-completion adjustments that arise with respect to a contract for which an election has been made. An election not to discount with respect to any contract is made by stating that an election is being made on the taxpayer's timely filed Federal income tax return (determined with regard to extensions) for the first tax year after completion in which the taxpayer takes into account (i.e., includes in income or deducts) any adjustment to the contract price or contract costs. See ยง 301.9100-8 of this chapter.
