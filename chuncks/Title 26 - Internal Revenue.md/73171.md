####### ยง 301.6226-3 Adjustments taken into account by partners.
######## Amount calculated at partner level.

(2)A reviewed year partner calculates the amount of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount relating to the partnership adjustments taken into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as if the correction amount were an underpayment or understatement of the reviewed year partner for the first affected year or intervening year, as applicable. The calculation of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount is based on the characteristics of, and facts and circumstances applicable to, the reviewed year partner for the first affected year or intervening year, as applicable after taking into account the partnership adjustments reflected on the statement. If after taking into account the partnership adjustments in accordance with this section, the reviewed year partner does not have an underpayment, or has an understatement that falls below the applicable threshold for the imposition of a penalty, no penalty is due from that reviewed year partner under this paragraph (d)(2). For penalties in the case of a pass-through partner that makes a payment under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, see paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section.
