####### Reference index.

(2)The reference index is an index used to measure inflation and deflation over the term of a debt instrument. To qualify as a reference index, an index must satisfy the following conditions:

(i) The value of the index is reset once a month to a current value of a single qualified inflation index (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section). For this purpose, a value of a qualified inflation index is current if the value has been updated and published within the preceding six month period.

(ii) The reset occurs on the same day of each month (the reset date).

(iii) The value of the index for any date between reset dates is determined through straight-line interpolation.
