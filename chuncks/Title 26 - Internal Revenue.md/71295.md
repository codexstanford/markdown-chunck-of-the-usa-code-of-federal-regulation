###### Certain transfers treated as exempt purpose expenditures

(d)-(1) An organization's transfer will be treated as an exempt purpose expenditure under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it is-

(i) Described in either paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section, and

(ii) Not described in paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) A transfer is described in this paragraph (d)(2) if it is made to an organization described in section 501(c)(3) in furtherance of the transferor's exempt purposes and is not earmarked for any purpose other than a purpose described in section 170(c)(2)(B). Thus, a payment of dues by a local or state organization to, respectively, a state or national organization that is described in section 501(c)(3) is considered an exempt purpose expenditure of the transferor to the extent it is not otherwise earmarked.

(3) A transfer is described in this paragraph (d)(3) if it is a controlled grant (as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section), but only to the extent of the amounts that are paid or incurred by the transferee that would be exempt purpose expenditures if paid or incurred by the transferor.
