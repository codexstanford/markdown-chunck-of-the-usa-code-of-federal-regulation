####### Step three: Determine the bond premium allocable to the accrual period.

(iii)The bond premium allocable to an accrual period is the excess of the qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period over the product of the holder's adjusted acquisition price (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) at the beginning of the accrual period and the holder's yield. In performing this calculation, the yield must be stated appropriately taking into account the length of the particular accrual period. Principles similar to those in ยง 1.1272-1(b)(4) apply in determining the bond premium allocable to an accrual period.
