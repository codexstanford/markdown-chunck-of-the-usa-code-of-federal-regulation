####### Major portion defined.

(ii)Whether a part of a building constitutes a major portion of the building is determined upon the basis of all the facts and circumstances. A major portion must generally consist of clearly identifiable parts of a building (e.g., a wing of a building or the first 5 stories of a 7 story building). The following factors shall be taken into account:

(A) Whether the portion comprises an entire leasehold interest or an entire ownership (e.g., condominium) interest;

(B) Whether the portion (as measured by volume) is sufficiently large that it would be reasonable to treat it as a separate building; and

(C) Whether the portion is functionally different from other parts of the building.
