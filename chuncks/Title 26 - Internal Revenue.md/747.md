####### Research funded by any grant, contract, or otherwise,In general.

(d)-(1)Research does not constitute qualified research to the extent it is funded by any grant, contract, or otherwise by another person (including any governmental entity). All agreements (not only research contracts) entered into between the taxpayer performing the research and other persons shall be considered in determining the extent to which the research is funded. Amounts payable under any agreement that are contingent on the success of the research and thus considered to be paid for the product or result of the research (see ยง 1.41-2(e)(2)) are not treated as funding. For special rules regarding funding between commonly controlled businesses, see ยง 1.41-6(e).
