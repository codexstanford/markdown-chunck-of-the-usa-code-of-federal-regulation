####### Income that is not incidental income.

(ii)Income that is attributable to non-financial activity is not incidental income within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section solely because such income represents a relatively small proportion of the taxpayer's total income or that the taxpayer engages in non-financial activity on a sporadic basis. Thus, for example, income from data processing services provided to related or unrelated parties or income from the sale of goods or non-financial services (for example travel services) is not financial services income, even if the recipient is a financial services entity.
