###### ยง 1.42-6 Buildings qualifying for carryover allocations.
####### 10 percent basis requirement.

(2)A carryover allocation may only be made with respect to a qualified building. A qualified building is any building which is part of a project if, by the date specified under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, a taxpayer's basis in the project is more than 10 percent of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project as of the close of the second calendar year following the calendar year the allocation is made. For purposes of meeting the 10 percent basis requirement, the determination of whether a building is part of a single-building project or multi-building project is based on whether the carryover allocation is made under section 42(h)(1)(E) (building-based allocation) or section 42(h)(1)(F) (project-based allocation). In the case of a multi-building project that receives an allocation under section 42(h)(1)(F), the 10 percent basis requirement is satisfied by reference to the entire project.
