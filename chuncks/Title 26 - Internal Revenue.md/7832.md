####### 4,Deconsolidation of S in nonrecognition transaction.,3,3,2,3

()The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(C)() of this section, except that, rather than sell all of its S stock to an unrelated third party, P causes S to merge with and into an unrelated third party in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A). As provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A)() of this section, the merger transaction is treated as a taxable disposition of all of P's stock in S for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(D) and (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section because S leaves the P group. Thus, the results are the same as in paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(C)() of this section.
