###### ยง 1.367(a)-8 Gain recognition agreement requirements.
####### Example 1. Taxpayer failed to file a GRA due to accidental oversight,Facts.

(i)-(A)DC filed its tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, reporting no gain with respect to the exchange of the FS stock. DC, through its tax department, was aware of the requirement to file a GRA in order for DC to avoid recognizing gain with respect to the FS Transfer under section 367(a)(1), and had the experience and competency to properly prepare the GRA. DC had filed many GRAs over the years and had never failed to timely file a GRA. However, although DC prepared the GRA with respect to the FS Transfer, it was not filed with DC's tax return for the year of the FS Transfer due to an accidental oversight. During the preparation of the following year's tax return, DC discovered that the GRA was not filed. DC filed an amended return to file the GRA and complied with the procedures set forth under paragraph (p)(2) of this section promptly after it became aware of the failure.
