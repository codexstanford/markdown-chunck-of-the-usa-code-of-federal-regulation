####### deductible current-year BIE

(B) Second, the loss corporation calculates its deductible current-year BIE and deducts this amount in determining its taxable income or net operating loss for the change year. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the termmeans the loss corporation's current-year business interest expense (including its floor plan financing interest expense, as defined in ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(19)), to the extent of its section 163(j) limitation.

(C) Third, if the loss corporation has disallowed business interest expense paid or accrued (without regard to section 163(j)) in the change year that is carried forward to post-change years, it allocates an equal portion of that disallowed business interest expense to each day in the change year. Any amount of disallowed business interest expense that is allocated to the pre-change period pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) is carried forward subject to section 382(d)(3). Any amount of disallowed business interest expense that is allocated to the post-change period pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) is carried forward and is not subject to section 382(d)(3).
