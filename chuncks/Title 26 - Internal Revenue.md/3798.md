Similarly, the limitation applies to the grantor or other person treated as the owner of a grantor trust with respect to items that are paid or incurred by a grantor trust and are treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of the grantor or other person pursuant to Subpart E, Part 1, Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code, but not to the trust itself. The 2-percent limitation applies to amounts otherwise deductible in taxable years of partners, shareholders, or grantors beginning after December 31, 1986, regardless of the taxable year of the partnership, corporation, or trust.
