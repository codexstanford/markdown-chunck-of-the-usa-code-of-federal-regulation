###### ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1 Deferring tax on capital gains by investing in opportunity zones.
####### Example 7. Pro-rata method.

(vii)The facts are the same as in examples 5 and 6, except that, in addition, during 2022 F sold an additional 400 R common shares. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, F must apply the FIFO method to identify which investments in R were disposed of. In 2022, F is treated as holding only the 800 R common shares purchased on a single day, and the section 1400Z-2 deferral election associated with these shares applies to gain with different characteristics (described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, therefore, R must use the pro-rata method to determine which of the characteristics pertain to the deferred gain required to be included as a result of the sale of the 400 R common shares. Under the pro-rata method, $150 of the inclusion is short-term capital gain ($300 x 400/800) and $350 is long-term capital gain ($700 x 400/800).
