Except as otherwise provided, deductions properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income include:

(i) Deductions attributable to a trade or business from which earned income is derived, except that if less than all the gross income from a trade or business constitutes earned income, only a ratable portion of the deductions attributable to such trade or business is allowable in respect of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the production of earned income,

(ii) Deductions consisting of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the performance of services as an employee,
