(2)If for any taxable year a taxpayer that was an insurance company for the year of change is no longer an insurance company, then the taxpayer must take into account in the preceding taxable year (that is, the last taxable year it was an insurance company) the balance of any section 481(a) adjustment determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A taxpayer that was an insurance company for the year of change does not accelerate the balance of any section 481(a) adjustment determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section merely because it changes from a life insurance company to a nonlife insurance company or because it changes from a nonlife insurance company to a life insurance company.
