####### Analysis.

(B)Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property, determined by fair market rental value, to Y, a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. X is not eligible for the de minimis exception under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section because X does not lease at least 90 percent of its real property to a party under common control, as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, such as Y, and Y is not using the property in an otherwise excepted trade or business. However, X is eligible for the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section because X leases 100 percent of its real property to Y, a party that is under common control, and Y subleases 100 percent of the real property to parties that are not under common control with X or Y. The fact that the license provided to hotel guests is not denominated as a lease does not prevent these licenses from being treated as a lease for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section. Accordingly, under the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with regard to its entire trade or business.
