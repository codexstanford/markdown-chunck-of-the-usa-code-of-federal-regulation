####### Changes in grantor trust status.

(ii)In general, a change in the income tax status of an existing trust owning a qualifying investment in a QOF, whether the termination of grantor trust status or the creation of grantor trust status, is an inclusion event. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the termination of grantor trust status as the result of the death of the owner of a qualifying investment is not an inclusion event, but the provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section apply to distributions or dispositions by the trust. If a qualifying investment is held in the grantor portion of an electing small business trust (ESBT), as defined in section 1361(e)(1), and the ESBT converts into a qualified subchapter S trust (QSST), as defined in section 1361(d)(3), the beneficiary of which is the deemed owner of the grantor portion of the ESBT, there has been no change in the grantor trust status because the deemed owner continues to be taxable under subtitle A of the Code on the income and gain from the qualifying investment.
