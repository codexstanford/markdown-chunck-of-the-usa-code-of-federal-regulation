(B)For purposes of paragraph (c)(7) of this section, if an item is attributable to more than one tested unit in a tier of tested units, the item is considered attributable only to the lowest-tier tested unit. Thus, for example, if a controlled foreign corporation directly owns a branch tested unit described in paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(A)() of this section, and an item of gross income is (under the rules of paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B) of this section) attributable to both the branch tested unit and the controlled foreign corporation tested unit, then the item is considered attributable only to the branch tested unit.
