(c)For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, payments are made pursuant to a qualifying rental assistance program administered under section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to the extent that the payments-

(1) Are made to a building owner pursuant to a contract with a public housing authority with respect to units the owner has agreed to maintain as public housing units (PH-units) in the building;

(2) Are made with respect to units occupied by public housing tenants, provided that, for this purpose, units may be considered occupied during periods of short term vacancy (not to exceed 60 days); and

(3) Do not exceed the difference between the rents received from a building's PH-unit tenants and a pro rata portion of the building's actual operating costs that are reasonably allocable to the PH-units (based on square footage, number of bedrooms, or similar objective criteria), and provided that, for this purpose, operating costs do not include any development costs of a building (including developer's fees) or the principal or interest of any debt incurred with respect to any part of the building.
