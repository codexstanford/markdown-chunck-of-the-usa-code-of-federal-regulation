####### ยง 48.4073-3 Exemption of tread rubber used for recapping nonhighway tires.
######## Sold direct by manufacturer for nontaxable use.

(a)The tax does not apply to the sale of tread rubber by the manufacturer to any person for use by that person otherwise than in the recapping or retreading of tires of the type used on highway vehicles. In determining whether tread rubber is sold for a taxable or nontaxable use, the type of vehicle on which the recapped or retreaded tire is to be used, or the actual or intended use of the recapped or retreaded tire, is immaterial. The controlling factor is whether the tire resulting from the recapping or retreading is of a type that is used otherwise than on a highway vehicle. For definition of "tires of the type used on highway vehicles", see paragraph (c) of ยง 48.4072-1.
