####### Analysis.,1

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), G is required to include $6,000, less the corresponding cost of goods sold under sections 263A and 471 as applicable, in gross income in 2021 as G has a fixed right to receive $6,000 from the delivery of 600 units to W in 2021. The anticipated chargebacks are liabilities that are accounted for under section 461. Under the AFS income inclusion rule and, specifically, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)() of this section, the amount treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" for 2021 is also $6,000, calculated as $3,600 of AFS revenue reported for 2021, increased by $2,400 of anticipated chargeback liabilities that are accounted for under section 461 ($3,600 + $2,400 = $6,000). Accordingly, G is required to include $6,000, less the corresponding cost of goods sold under sections 263A and 471 as applicable, in gross income in 2021.
