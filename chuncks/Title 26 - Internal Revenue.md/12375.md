() Until the year in which the taxpayer attains the age of 65 (but in no case for a period of less than 5 years).

(ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, expenses paid for medical care shall include amounts paid for accident or health insurance. In determining whether a contract constitutes an "insurance" contract it is irrelevant whether the benefits are payable in cash or in services. For example, amounts paid for hospitalization insurance, for membership in an association furnishing cooperative or so-called free-choice medical service, or for group hospitalization and clinical care are expenses paid for medical care.
