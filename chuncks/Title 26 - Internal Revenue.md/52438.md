####### Analysis.

(ii)The analysis for tax years prior to 2030 is the same as in paragraphs (j)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section. In addition, applying the analysis in paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, B is entitled to make the election under section 1400Z-2(c) and B makes the election. Following the election, if S and B were divisions of a single entity, the single entity's basis in Q would increase from $100x to $225x, causing to be excluded the $125x of gain on the sale of Q stock. To achieve this single entity result, ยง 1.1502-13(c)(1) redetermines B's $25x ($225x-$250x) of loss to be a noncapital, nondeductible expense and S's deferred $150x of capital gain to be tax-exempt income. Therefore, as a result of the sale of Q stock and B making the section 1400Z-2 election, S has $150x of tax-exempt income, and B has $25x of noncapital, nondeductible expense.
