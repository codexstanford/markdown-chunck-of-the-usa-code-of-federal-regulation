####### Certain options in existence immediately before and after an ownership change.

(v)If an option existed immediately before and after an ownership change occurring on a testing date to which ยง 1.382-2T(h)(4) applies-

(A) The option is not treated as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on any testing date after the change date and prior to a transfer of the option that would itself cause the option to satisfy the ownership test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the control test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or the income test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section; and

(B) Except as provided in ยง 1.382-2T(m)(4)(vi) (which relates to the effective date of the rules provided in ยง 1.382-2T(h)(4) and includes a special rule related to options that are actually exercised within 120 days after they are treated as exercised under that section), the actual exercise of the option, if by the person who owned the option immediately after the ownership change (or by a transferee of the option who acquired the option, directly or indirectly, from that person in one or more transfers described in paragraph (d)(11) of this section), will not contribute to an ownership change on any testing date on or after the date of exercise.
