####### Termination of sponsored FFI.

(iii)If the IRS notifies the sponsoring entity that the status of a sponsored FFI is terminated (but not the sponsoring entity's status), the sponsoring entity must remove the sponsored FFI from the sponsoring entity's registration account on the FATCA registration website and send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each withholding agent from which the sponsored FFI receives payments and each financial institution with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or other documentation was provided with respect to such sponsored FFI. A sponsored FFI that has had its status as a sponsored FFI terminated (independent from a termination of status of its sponsoring entity) may not register on the FATCA registration website as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI unless it receives written approval from the IRS.
