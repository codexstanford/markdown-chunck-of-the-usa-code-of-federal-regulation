####### Analysis.

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), B is required to include $55,000 in gross income in 2021 as B has a fixed right to receive $55,000 as of the end of 2021. However, under the AFS income inclusion rule, because B has an enforceable right to recover the entire $60,000 that was reported in AFS revenue for 2021 had the customer terminated the contract on the last day of 2021, the entire $60,000 is treated as taken into account as AFS revenue in 2021. Accordingly, the all events test is met for the $60,000 of gross income no later than the end of 2021 and B is required to include $60,000 in gross income in 2021.
