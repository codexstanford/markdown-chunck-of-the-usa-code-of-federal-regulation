####### Illustration.

(iv)To illustrate the application of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, assume that a calendar-year corporation makes a qualified investment in 1977 and that 1977 is an unused credit year described in section 46(b)(1). If the general rule is applied, 1977 is an applicable year. However, because 1977 is an unused credit year (at least with respect to the additional credit), if the corporation does not elect to treat 1977 as an applicable year but carries over its entire additional credit for 1977 to 1978 and uses it in 1978, then 1978 is an applicable year. If part of the additional credit is carried over further to 1979, the year 1979 is also an applicable year.
