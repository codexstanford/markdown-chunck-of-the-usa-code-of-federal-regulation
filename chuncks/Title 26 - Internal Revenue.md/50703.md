####### Standing instructions to pay amounts.,standing instructions to pay amounts

(126)The termmeans current payment instructions provided by the account holder, or an agent of the account holder, that will repeat without further instructions being provided by the account holder. Therefore, for example, a payment instruction to make an isolated payment is not a standing instruction to pay amounts, even if the instructions are given one year in advance. However, an instruction to make payments indefinitely is a standing instruction to pay amounts for the period during which such instructions are in effect, even if such instructions are amended after a single payment.
