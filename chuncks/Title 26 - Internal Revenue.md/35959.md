###### ยง 1.871-10 Election to treat real property income as effectively connected with U.S. business.
####### Treatment of property to which election applies.

(2)Any real property, or interest in real property, with respect to which an election under this section applies shall be treated as a capital asset which, if depreciable, is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167 and the regulations thereunder. Such property, or interest in property, shall be treated as property not used in a trade or business for purposes of applying any provisions of the Code, such as section 172(d)(4)(A), relating to gain or loss attributable to a trade or business for purposes of determining a net operating loss; section 1221(2), relating to property not constituting a capital asset; or section 1231(b), relating to special rules for treatment of gains and losses. For example, if a nonresident alien individual makes the election under this section and, while the election is in effect, sells unimproved land which is located in the United States and held for investment purposes, any gain or loss from the sale shall be considered gain or loss from the sale of a capital asset and shall be treated, for purposes of determining the tax under section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of ยง 1.871-8, as a gain or loss which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
