####### Capital losses.

(6)(i) The deduction for capital losses under section 822(c)(6) includes not only capital losses to the extent provided in subchapter P, chapter 1 of the Code but in addition thereto losses from capital assets sold or exchanged to provide funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. Losses in the latter case may be deducted from ordinary income while the deduction for losses under subchapter P is limited to the gains. See section 1211.

(ii) Capital assets are considered as sold or exchanged to provide for the funds or payments specified in section 822(c)(6), to the extent that the gross receipts from the sale or exchange of such assets are not greater than the excess, if any, for the taxable year of the sum of dividends and similar distributions paid to policyholders, and losses and expenses paid over the sum of the items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received. If, by reason of a particular sale or exchange of a capital asset, gross receipts are greater than such excess, the gross receipts and the resulting loss should be apportioned and the excess included in capital losses subject to the provisions of subchapter P. Capital losses actually used to reduce net income in any taxable year may not again be used in a succeeding taxable year as an offset against capital gains in that year and for that purpose a special rule is set forth for the application of section 1212.

(iii) The application of section 822(c)(6) may be illustrated by the following examples:
