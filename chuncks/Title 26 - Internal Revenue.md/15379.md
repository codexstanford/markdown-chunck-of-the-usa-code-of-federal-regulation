()Employer Q is an automobile service center and provides refreshments in its waiting area. The refreshments are consumed by Q's employees and customers, and Q reasonably estimates that more than 50 percent of the refreshments are consumed by customers. Under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the expenses associated with the refreshments are not subject to the deduction limitations provided for in paragraph (a) of this section because the food and beverages are primarily consumed by customers. Thus, Q may deduct 100 percent of the food and beverage expenses.
