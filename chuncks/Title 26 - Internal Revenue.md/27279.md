###### ยง 1.482-1 Allocation of income and deductions among taxpayers.
####### Arm's length range not prerequisite to allocation.

(4)The rules of this paragraph (e) do not require that the district director establish an arm's length range prior to making an allocation under section 482. Thus, for example, the district director may properly propose an allocation on the basis of a single comparable uncontrolled price if the comparable uncontrolled price method, as described in ยง 1.482-3(b), has been properly applied. However, if the taxpayer subsequently demonstrates that the results claimed on its income tax return are within the range established by additional equally reliable comparable uncontrolled prices in a manner consistent with the requirements set forth in ยง 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii), then no allocation will be made.
