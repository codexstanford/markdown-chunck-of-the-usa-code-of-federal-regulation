(104)-(i) The termmeans any account, instrument, contract, debt, or equity interest maintained, executed, or issued by the withholding agent that is outstanding on June 30, 2014. With respect to a participating FFI, the termmeans any account, instrument, or contract (including any debt or equity interest) maintained, executed, or issued by the FFI that is outstanding on the effective date of the FFI agreement. With respect to a registered deemed-compliant FFI, a preexisting obligation means any account, instrument, or contract (including any debt or equity interest) that is maintained, executed, or issued by the FFI prior to the later of the date that the FFI registers as a deemed-compliant FFI pursuant to § 1.1471-5(f)(1) and receives a GIIN or the date the FFI is required to implement its account opening procedures under § 1.1471-5(f). Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph (b)(104)(i), a preexisting obligation includes an obligation held by an entity that is issued, opened, or executed on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, by or with a withholding agent or FFI that treats the obligation as a preexisting obligation. See §§ 1.1471-2(a)(4)(ii), 1.1472-1(b)(2), and 1.1471-4(c)(3) for the due diligence requirements applicable to preexisting obligations for withholding agents and participating FFIs.
