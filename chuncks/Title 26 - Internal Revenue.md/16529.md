####### Gain and loss offsets.

(ii)Gains and losses recognized on the deemed asset sales by targets included in a combined return are treated as the gains and losses of a single target. In addition, loss carryovers of a target that were not subject to the separate return limitation year restrictions (SRLY restrictions) of the consolidated return regulations while that target was a member of the selling consolidated group may be applied without limitation to the gains of other targets included in the combined return. If, however, a target has loss carryovers that were subject to the SRLY restrictions while that target was a member of the selling consolidated group, the use of those losses in the combined return continues to be subject to those restrictions, applied in the same manner as if the combined return were a consolidated return. A similar rule applies, when appropriate, to other tax attributes.
