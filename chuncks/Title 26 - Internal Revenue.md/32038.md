() Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(iv)()() of this section, the revaluation is required under ยง 1.721(c)-3(d)(1) as a condition of the application of the gain deferral method (as described in ยง 1.721(c)-3(b)) and is pursuant to an event described in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)()(). If an interest in a partnership is contributed to a section 721(c) partnership (as defined in ยง 1.721(c)-1(b)(14)), the partnership whose interest is contributed may revalue its property in accordance with this section. In this case, the revaluation by the partnership whose interest was contributed must occur immediately before the contribution. If a partnership that revalues its property pursuant to this paragraph owns an interest in another partnership, the partnership in which it owns an interest may also revalue its property in accordance with this section. When multiple partnerships revalue under this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(f)(6), the revaluations occur in order from the lowest-tier partnership to the highest-tier partnership.
