A corporation which qualifies as an export trade corporation (ETC) with respect to its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1985, and elects to discontinue operations as an ETC for all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, shall not be required to take into income earnings attributable to previously excluded export trade income, as defined in ยง 1.970-1(b), derived with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1985. However, any amounts distributed by the former ETC (a corporation which was an ETC for its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1985) shall be treated as being made out of current earnings and profits and then out of previously taxed income. For purposes of determining the shareholder's basis in the ETC stock, distributions of previously excluded export trade income shall be treated as if made out of previously taxed income which has already been included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(B). Thus, no basis adjustment under section 961 is necessary. In addition, upon the sale or exchange of the stock of such corporation in a transaction described in section 1248(a), the earnings and profits of the corporation attributable to such previously untaxed income shall not be subject to section 1248(a).
