####### Inclusion of current year items.

(2)For a current taxable year, the items of income and deductions (including for taxes), and the U.S. dollar amounts of current year taxes, that are included in the computations described in this section and assigned to income groups and PTEP groups for the taxable year are the items that the controlled foreign corporation accrues and takes into account during the current taxable year. An item of income with respect to a current taxable year does not include an amount included as subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation by reason of the recharacterization of a recapture account established in a prior U.S. taxable year (and the corresponding earnings and profits) of the controlled foreign corporation under section 952(c)(2) and ยง 1.952-1(f).
