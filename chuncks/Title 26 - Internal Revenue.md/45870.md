####### Addition to capital account.,addition to capital account

(2)(i) In the case of any section 1250 property, an addition to capital account described in this subparagraph is any addition to capital account in respect of such property after its initial acquisition or completion by the taxpayer or by any person who held the property during a period included in the taxpayer's holding period (see § 1.1250-4) for the property. An addition to the capital account of section 1250 property may arise, for example, if there is an expenditure for section 1250 property which is an improvement, replacement, addition, or alteration to such property (regardless of whether the cost thereof is capitalized or charged against the depreciation reserve). In such a case, theis the gross addition, unreduced by amounts attributable to replaced property, to the net capital account and not the net addition to such account. Thus, if a roof has an adjusted basis of $20,000, and is replaced by constructing a new roof at a cost of $50,000, the gross addition of $50,000 is an addition to capital account. (The adjusted basis of the old roof is no longer included in the capital account for the property.) For purposes of this section, the status of an addition to capital account is not affected by whether or not it is treated as a separate property for purposes of determining depreciation adjustments. In case of an addition to the capital account of property arising after December 31, 1963, upon a disposition referred to in section 1250(d)(4) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions) of a portion of an item of such property, the amount of such addition (and its basis for all purposes of the Code) shall be the basis thereof determined under paragraph (d) (2), (3), or (4) (whichever is applicable) of § 1.1250-3, applied by treating such portion and such addition as separate properties.

(ii) An addition to capital account may be attributable to an excess of the adjusted basis of section 1250 property in the hands of a transferee immediately after a transaction referred to in section 1250(e)(2) (relating to holding period of property with transferred basis) over its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transaction. Thus, for example, such excess may arise from a gift which is in part a sale or exchange (see paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1250-3), from an increase in basis due to gift tax paid (see section 1015(d)), from a transfer referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to certain tax-free transactions) in which gain is partially recognized, or from a distribution by a partnership to a partner in which no gain is recognized by reason of the application of section 731. Similarly, an addition to capital account may be attributable to an excess of the adjusted basis of a principal residence acquired in a transaction referred to in section 1250(e)(3) over the adjusted basis of the principal residence disposed of, as well as to any increase in the adjusted basis of section 1250 property of a partnership by reason of an optional basis adjustment under section 734(b) or 743(b).

(iii) Whether or not an expenditure shall be treated as an addition to capital account described in this subparagraph, as distinguished from a separate item of property, may depend on how the property or properties are disposed of. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer, who owns a motel consisting of 10 buildings with common heating and plumbing systems, adds to the motel three new buildings which are connected to the common systems, and if the taxpayer sells the motel to one person in one transaction, then for purposes of this subparagraph the cost of the three new buildings shall be treated as an addition to the capital account of the motel and, if the 1-year and 36-month tests of subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph are satisfied, the motel consists of at least two elements. If, however, the 10-building group and the three-building group were individually sold in separate transactions to two different people each of whom would operate his group as a separate business, the motel would consist of two items of property.
