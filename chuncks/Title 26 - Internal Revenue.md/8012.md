### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### ยง 1.163(j)-2 Deduction for business interest expense limited.
####### Analysis.

(ii)Section 163(j) does not apply to D for the taxable year, because D qualifies for the small business exemption under ยง 1.163(j)-2(d). The wages that D receives as an employee and the compensatory damages that D received from D's personal injury lawsuit are not gross receipts, as provided in ยง 1.163(j)-2(d)(2)(ii). D may deduct all of its business interest expense for the 2021 taxable year without regard to section 163(j).
