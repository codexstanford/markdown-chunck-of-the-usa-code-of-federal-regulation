####### Exception for a qualifying S corporation interest.

(2)Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an organization may aggregate its UBTI from an S corporation interest with its UBTI from other investment activities (described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) if the organization's ownership interest in the S corporation meets the criteria for a QPI as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (substituting "S corporation" for "partnership" and "shareholder" or "shareholders" for "partner" or "partners," as applicable, throughout paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5)(iii), (c)(5)(iv), and (c)(6) of this section; "no more than 2 percent of stock ownership" for "no more than 2 percent of the profits interest and no more than 2 percent of the capital interest" in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; "no more than 20 percent of stock ownership" in place of "no more than 20 percent of the capital interest" in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section; and "Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)" for "Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)" for purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section). Paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (c)(5)(ii) do not apply for purposes of determining an organization's ownership interest in an S corporation; rather, the average percentage stock ownership determined under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section applies for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2). For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section, an organization can rely on the Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) (or its successor) it receives from the S corporation only if the form lists information sufficient to determine the organization's percentage of stock ownership for the year. A Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) that reports "zero" as the organization's number of shares of stock in either the beginning or end of the S corporation's taxable year does not list information sufficient to determine the organization's percentage of stock ownership for the year. The grace period described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section applies to changes in an exempt organization's percentage of stock ownership in an S corporation.
