(B)As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (), the portion of these modifications that implements the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of Debt X. However, the portion of these modifications that adds 30 basis points to the rate on Debt X changes the amount of cash flows on Debt X, and the parties intend that change to compensate L for a change in rights or obligations that are not derived from Debt X (the modification of customary financial covenants in Debt Y). Therefore, the portion of these modifications that adds those 30 basis points to the rate on Debt X is described in paragraph (j)(4) of this section and, consequently, is a noncovered modification of Debt X. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
