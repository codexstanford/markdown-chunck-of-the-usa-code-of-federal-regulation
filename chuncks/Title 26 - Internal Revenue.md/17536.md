####### Triggering events.

(j)Except as provided in this section, if an event described in paragraphs (j)(1) through (10) of this section (triggering event) occurs during the GRA term, the U.S. transferor must recognize gain under the gain recognition agreement in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. This paragraph (j) generally requires the U.S. transferor to recognize gain (and pay applicable interest with respect to any additional tax due as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section) under the gain recognition agreement to the extent the transferred stock or securities are disposed of, directly or indirectly. This paragraph (j) also requires the U.S. transferor to recognize gain under the gain recognition agreement in certain cases where it is not appropriate for the gain recognition agreement to continue. See paragraph (k) of this section for exceptions available for certain events that would otherwise constitute triggering events under this paragraph (j). See paragraph (o) of this section for certain events that terminate or reduce the amount of gain subject to a gain recognition agreement.
