####### In general.

(a)Section 468B, including section 468B(g), is effective as provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. Except as otherwise provided in this section, §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468-4 are effective on January 1, 1993. Thus, the regulations apply to income of a qualified settlement fund earned after December 31, 1992, transfers to a fund after December 31, 1992, and distributions from a fund after December 31, 1992. For purposes of § 1.468B-3(c) (relating to economic performance), previously transferred assets held by a qualified settlement fund on the date these regulations first apply to the fund (i.e., January 1, 1993, or the earlier date provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) are treated as transferred to the fund on that date, to the extent no taxpayer has previously claimed a deduction for the transfer.
