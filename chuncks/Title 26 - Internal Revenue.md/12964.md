####### Facts.

(i)CFC is a reverse hybrid. In Year 1, CFC earns a $500x item of gain described in section 907(c)(1)(B) that is non-inclusion income. CFC also earns for Federal income tax purposes and Country A tax purposes a $1,000x item of royalty income, of which $500x is gross included tested income and $500x is non-inclusion income. USP includes the $500x item of foreign gain and the $1,000x item of foreign gross royalty income in its Country A taxable income, and the items are foreign law pass-through income. If CFC included these items under Country A tax law, its $1,000x of royalty income for Federal income tax purposes would be the corresponding U.S. item for the foreign gross royalty income, and its $500x of gain for Federal income tax purposes would be the corresponding U.S. item for the foreign gain. Country A imposes a $150x foreign income tax on USP with respect to $1,500x of foreign gross income.
