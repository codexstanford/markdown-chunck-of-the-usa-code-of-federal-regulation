###### ยง 1.468A-5 Nuclear decommissioning fund - miscellaneous provisions.
####### Substantial completion of decommissioning and termination date.

(3)(i) The substantial completion of the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant occurs on the date on which all Federal, state, local, and contractual decommissioning requirements are fully satisfied (the substantial completion date). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the substantial completion date is also the termination date.

(ii) If a significant portion of the total estimated decommissioning costs with respect to a nuclear power plant are not incurred on or before the substantial completion date, an electing taxpayer may request, and the IRS will issue, a ruling that designates a date subsequent to the substantial completion date as the termination date. The termination date designated in the ruling will not be later than the last day of the third taxable year after the taxable year that includes the substantial completion date. The request for a ruling under this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) must be filed during the taxable year that includes the substantial completion date and must comply with the procedural rules in effect at the time of the request.
