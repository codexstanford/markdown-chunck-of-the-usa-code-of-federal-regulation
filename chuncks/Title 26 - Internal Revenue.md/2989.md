##### Tax Preference Regulations
###### ยง 1.58-7 Tax preferences attributable to foreign sources; preferences other than capital gains and stock options.
####### In general.

(a)Section 58(g)(1) provides that except in the case of the stock options item of tax preference (section 57(a)(6) and ยง 1.57-1(f)) and the capital gains item of tax preference (section 57(a)(9) and ยง 1.57-1(i)), items of tax preference which are attributable to sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States shall, for purposes of section 56, be taken into account only to the extent that such items reduce the tax imposed by chapter 1 (other than the minimum tax under section 56) on income derived from sources within the United States. Items of tax preference from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States reduce the chapter 1 tax on income from sources within the United States to the extent the deduction relating to such preferences, in combination with other foreign deductions, exceed the income from such sources and, in effect, offset income from sources within the United States. Items of tax preference, for this purpose, are determined after application of ยง 1.57-4 (relating to limitation on amounts treated as items of tax preference). In the case of a taxpayer who deducted foreign taxes under section 164 for a taxable year, the provisions of this section shall be applied (without regard to section 275(a)(4)) as if he had elected the overall foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(a) (2) for such year.
