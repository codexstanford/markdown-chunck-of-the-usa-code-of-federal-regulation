(2)Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) (3) and (4) of this section, a State's housing credit ceiling is apportioned in its entirety to the State housing credit agency. Such an apportionment is the "primary apportionment" of a State's housing credit ceiling. There shall be no primary apportionment of the State housing credit ceiling and no grants of housing credit allocations in such State until a State housing credit agency is authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute. If a State has more than one State housing credit agency, such agencies shall be treated as a single agency for purposes of the primary apportionment. In such a case, the State housing credit ceiling may be divided among the multiple State housing credit agencies pursuant to gubernatorial act or State statute.
