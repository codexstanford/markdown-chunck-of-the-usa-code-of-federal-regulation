####### Analysis.

(ii)(A) As provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(E) of this section, if a taxpayer applies the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the taxpayer must begin with the lowest-tier entity to which it is eligible to apply the look-through rules. Corp A directly owns 100 percent of the stock of Corp C; thus, Corp A satisfies the 80 percent minimum ownership threshold with respect to Corp C. Corp A also owns 10 percent of the interests in PS1. There is no minimum ownership threshold for partnerships; thus, Corp A may apply the look-through rules to PS1. However, Corp A does not directly or indirectly own at least 80 percent of the stock of Corp D; thus, Corp A cannot look through its indirect interest in Corp D. In turn, Corp B directly owns 90 percent of the interests in PS1, and Corp B indirectly owns at least 80 percent of the stock of Corp D. Thus, Corp B must apply the look-through rules to PS1 and Corp D.
