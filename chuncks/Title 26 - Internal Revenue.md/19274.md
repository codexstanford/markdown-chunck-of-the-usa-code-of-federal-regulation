####### Transition rule for certain covered debt instruments treated as stock in taxable years ending on or after

(ii)January 19, 2017. If paragraphs (b) and (d)(1) of this section, taking into account §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4, would treat a covered debt instrument as stock on or before January 19, 2017 but in a taxable year ending on or after January 19, 2017, that covered debt instrument is not treated as stock during the 90-day period after October 21, 2016. Instead, to the extent that the covered debt instrument is held by a member of the expanded group of which the issuer is a member immediately after January 19, 2017, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock immediately after January 19, 2017.
