(6)Section 1101(f) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 provides an exception to the effective date rules in this paragraph and in paragraph (h) of this section. Section 1101(f)(2) of the Act provides that section 993(c)(2)(C) and (D) shall not apply to sales, exchanges, and other dispositions made after March 18, 1975, but before March 19, 1980, if they are made pursuant to a fixed contract. Section 1101(f)(2) also defines fixed contract. Under that definition, if the seller can vary the price of the product for unspecified cost increases (which could include tax cost increases), or if the quantity of products or commodities to be sold can be increased or decreased under the contract by the seller without penalty, the contract is not to be considered a fixed contract with respect to the amount over which the seller has discretion. For example, if a contract calls for a minimum delivery ofamount of a product but allows the seller to refuse to deliver goods beyond that minimum amount (or allows a renegotiation of the sales price of goods beyond that amount), then with respect to the amount above the minimum the contract is not a fixed quantity contract.
