####### Expert advice,In general.

(2)-(i)The reasonable reliance on a reasoned, written opinion as to the characterization for purposes of section 856 of gross income to be derived (or being derived) from a transaction generally constitutes "reasonable cause" if income from that transaction causes the trust to fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs). The absence of such a reasoned, written opinion with respect to a transaction does not, by itself, give rise to any inference that the failure to meet a percentage of income requirement was without reasonable cause. An opinion as to the character of income from a transaction includes an opinion pertaining to the use of a standard form of transaction or standard operating procedure in a case where such standard form or procedure is in fact used or followed.

(ii) If the opinion indicates that a portion of the income from a transaction will be nonqualifed income, the trust must still exercise ordinary business care and prudence with respect to the nonqualified income and determine that the amount of that income, in the context of its overall portfolio, reasonably cannot be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed. Reliance on an opinion is not reasonable if the trust has reason to believe that the opinion is incorrect (for example, because the trust withholds facts from the person rendering the opinion).
