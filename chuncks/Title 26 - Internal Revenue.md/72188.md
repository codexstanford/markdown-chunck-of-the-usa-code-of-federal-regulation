(ii) No such officer or employee to whom return information reflected on returns is disclosed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall disclose such information to any person, other than the taxpayer to whom such return information reflected on returns relates or other officers or employees of such bureau whose duties or responsibilities require such disclosure for a purpose described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, except in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.
