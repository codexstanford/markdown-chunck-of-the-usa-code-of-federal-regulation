###### ยง 1.9000-7 Provisions for estimated tax.
####### Additions to tax under section 294(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

(a)Any addition to the tax under section 294(d) (relating to estimated tax) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be computed as if the tax for the year for which the estimate was made were computed with sections 452 and 462 still applicable to such taxable year. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, it is not necessary for the taxpayer actually to have made an election under section 452 or 462; it is only necessary for the taxpayer to have taken such sections into account in estimating its tax liability for the year. Thus, if in determining the amount of estimated tax, the taxpayer computed his estimated tax liability by applying those sections, that portion of any additions to tax under section 294(d) resulting from the repeal of sections 452 and 462 shall be disregarded.
