####### State employees.

(3)For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the term "wages" includes such remuneration for services covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act, relating to voluntary agreements for coverage of employees of State and local governments, as would be wages if such services constituted employment (see ยง 31.3121(a)-1, relating to wages); the term "employer" includes a State or any political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; and the term "tax" or "tax imposed by section 3101" includes an amount equivalent to the employee tax which would be imposed by section 3101 if such services constituted employment. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable whether or not any amount deducted from an employee's remuneration as a result of an agreement made pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act has been paid pursuant to such agreement. Thus, the special refund provisions are applicable to amounts equivalent to employee tax deducted from employees' remuneration by States, political subdivisions, or instrumentalities by reason of agreements made under section 218 of the Social Security Act. Moreover, if during any calendar year an employee receives remuneration for services covered by such an agreement and during the same calendar year receives wages from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such remuneration and wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.
