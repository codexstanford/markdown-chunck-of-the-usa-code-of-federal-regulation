####### Definition.,preceding taxable year

(a)For purposes of subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the termdoes not include any taxable year to which such part I does not apply. See section 683 and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the provisions of such subpart D may not, in general, be applied to any taxable year which begins before 1954 or ends before August 17, 1954. For example, if a trust (reporting on the calendar year basis) makes a distribution during the calendar year 1955 of income accumulated during prior years and the distribution exceeds the distributable net income of 1955, the excess distribution may be allocated under such subpart D to 1954, but it may not be allocated to 1953 and preceding years, since the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies to those years.
