###### ยง 1.904(g)-3 Ordering rules for the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and for the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses, and overall domestic losses.
####### Analysis,Loss allocation.

(ii)-(A)Under paragraph (d) of this section (Step 3), the $100x of passive category loss offsets $100x of the foreign branch category income, creating a passive category SLL account of $100x with respect to the foreign branch category. Because there is an offsetting foreign branch category SLL account of $200x with respect to the passive category from a prior taxable year, the two accounts are netted against each other so that all that remains is a $100x foreign branch category SLL account with respect to the passive category.
