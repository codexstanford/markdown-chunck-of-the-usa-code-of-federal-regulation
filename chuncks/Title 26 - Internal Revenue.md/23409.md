###### ยง 1.430(h)(3)-1 Mortality tables used to determine present value.
####### Probability of survival for an individual.

(B)After the projected mortality rates are derived for each age for each year, the rates are used to calculate the present value of a benefit stream that depends on the probability of survival year-by-year. For example, for purposes of calculating the present value (for a 2018 valuation date) of future payments in a benefit stream payable for a male annuitant who is age 66 in 2018, the probability of survival for the annuitant is based on the mortality rate for a male annuitant who is age 66 in 2018 (0.012371), and the projected mortality rate for a male annuitant who will be age 67 in 2019 (0.013302), age 68 in 2020 (0.014321), and so on.
