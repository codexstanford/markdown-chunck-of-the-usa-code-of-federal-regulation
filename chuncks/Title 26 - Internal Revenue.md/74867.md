######## Incomplete information.

(3)For purposes of this section, the term "incomplete information" means a Form 8918 (or successor form) filed with the IRS that does not provide the information required under ยง 301.6111-3(d). A Form 8918 (or successor form) filed with the IRS will not be considered incomplete when the information not provided on the form is immaterial or was not provided due to mistake or accident after the exercise of reasonable care. Whether information is immaterial will be determined based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding each failure to file or filing of an incomplete return. A material advisor who completes the form to the best of the material advisor's ability and knowledge after the exercise of reasonable effort to obtain the information will not be considered to have filed incomplete information within the meaning of this section. A Form 8918 (or successor form) will be considered to provide incomplete information when it omits information required to be provided under ยง 301.6111-3(d) or contains a statement that the omitted information will be provided upon request.
