## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury

###### ยง 1.167(l)-1 Limitations on reasonable allowance in case of property of certain public utilities.
####### Placed in service.

(2)For purposes of this section, property is placed in service on the date on which the period for depreciation begins under section 167. See, for example, ยง 1.167(a)-10(b) and ยง 1.167(a)-11(c)(2). If under an averaging convention property which is placed in service (as defined in ยง 1.46-3(d)(ii)) by the taxpayer on different dates is treated as placed in service on the same date, then for purposes of section 167(l) the property shall be treated as having been placed in service on the date the period for depreciation with respect to such property would begin under section 167 absent such averaging convention. Thus, for example, if, except for the fact that the averaging convention used assumes that all additions and retirements made during the first half of the year were made on the first day of the year, the period of depreciation for two items of public utility property would begin on January 10 and March 15, respectively, then for purposes of determining the property of the same (or similar) kind most recently placed in service, such items of property shall be treated as placed in service on January 10 and March 15, respectively.
