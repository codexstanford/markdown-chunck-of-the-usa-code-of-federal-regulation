######## Determining the aggregate of the correction amounts,In general.

(b)-(1)For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the aggregate of the correction amounts is the sum of the correction amounts described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. A correction amount under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section may be less than zero, and any correction amount that is less than zero may reduce any other correction amount with the result that the aggregate of the correction amounts under this paragraph (b)(1) may also be less than zero. However, nothing in this section entitles any partner to a refund of chapter 1 tax to which such partner is not entitled. See paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section requiring a separate determination of interest and penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts on the correction amount for each applicable taxable year (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) without regard to the correction amount for any other applicable taxable year.
