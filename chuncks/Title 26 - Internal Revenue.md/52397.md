###### ยง 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Deconsolidation and inclusion event.

(2)A deconsolidation event is not an inclusion event unless the deconsolidation is the result of an actual transfer of the QOF member stock or a worthlessness event within the meaning of ยง 1.1502-80(c). For example, when a consolidated group fails to meet the conditions in ยง 1.1504-3(b)(2) of this section and causes a QOF member to deconsolidate, the deconsolidation event is not an inclusion event solely as a result of the consolidated group's failure to meet the requirements in ยง 1.1504-3(b)(2) of this section.
