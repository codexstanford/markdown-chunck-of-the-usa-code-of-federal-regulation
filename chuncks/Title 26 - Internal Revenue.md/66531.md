######## Manufacturer.

(g)The term "manufacturer" means manufacturer, producer, or importer. A person who converts, by any process, a new tire taxable under section 4071 at one rate of tax into a tire taxable under section 4071 at a different rate (as for example, an off highway-type tire converted into a highway-type tire) is considered to be a manufacturer of the converted tire. If a conversion results in a reduced rate of tax for the converted tire, see section 6416(b)(2) and ยง 48.6416(b)-2 to secure a credit or refund of part of the tax paid. The term "manufactured" includes "produced" and "imported".
