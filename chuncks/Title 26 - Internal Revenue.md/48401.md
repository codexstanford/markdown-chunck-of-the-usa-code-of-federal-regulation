####### Exception for net gain from certain section 1256 contracts.,1

(B)Paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A)() of this section does not apply to the net gain during the taxable year from section 1256 contracts that were not part of a straddle at any time during the taxable year (qualified section 1256 contracts). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B), the net gain during the taxable year from qualified section 1256 contracts is determined by taking into account all capital gains and losses from such contracts for the taxable year that are recognized for Federal income tax purposes, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(a)(1). The 180-day period with respect to any eligible gain described in this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B) begins on the last day of the taxable year, and the character of that gain when it is later included under sections 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and 1400Z-2(b) is determined under the general rule in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If, under section 1256(a)(4), section 1092 does not apply to a straddle, such straddle is not treated as a straddle for purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B).
