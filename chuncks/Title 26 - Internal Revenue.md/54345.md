(ii)Pursuant to Rev. Rul. 99-5, the transaction is treated as if P sold 33 percent of its interest in each of DE1's assets to T and then immediately thereafter P and T transferred their interests in the assets of DE1to a partnership in exchange for an ownership interest therein. Upon the transfer of 33 percent of P's interest to T, a domestic corporation, no foreign use occurs and, therefore, there is no foreign use triggering event. However, P's deemed transfer of 67 percent of its interest in the assets of DE1to a partnership is nominally a triggering event under ยง 1.1503(d)-6(e)(1)(iv). Because the initial transfer of 33 percent of DE1's interest was to a domestic corporation and there is only a triggering event because of the deemed transfer under Rev. Rul. 99-5, the deemed asset transfer is not treated as resulting in a triggering event pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-6(f)(4).
