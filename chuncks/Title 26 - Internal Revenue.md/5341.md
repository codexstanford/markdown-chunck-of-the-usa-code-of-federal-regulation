##### Items Specifically Excluded From Gross Income
###### ยง 1.132-8 Fringe benefit nondiscrimination rules.
####### Aggregation of employees,Section 132(a) (1) and (2).

(b)-(1)For purposes of determining whether the exclusions for no-additional-cost services and qualified employee discounts are available to highly compensated employees, the nondiscrimination rules of this section are applied by aggregating the employees of all related employers (as defined in ยง 1.132-1(c)), except that employees in different lines of business (as defined in ยง 1.132-4) are not to be aggregated. Thus, in general, for purposes of this section, the term "employees of the employer" refers to all employees of the employer and any other entity that is a member of a group described in sections 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o) and that performs services within the same line of business as the employer which provides the particular fringe benefit. Employees in different lines of business will be aggregated, however, if the line of business limitation has been relaxed pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (g) of ยง 1.132-4.
