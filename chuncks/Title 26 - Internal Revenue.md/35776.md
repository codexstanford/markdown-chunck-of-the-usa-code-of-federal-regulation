()The material change in circumstances rule described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section applies if due to a material change in circumstances, the sourcing rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section provides a sourcing result that is materially different from the sourcing result that would occur if that sourcing rule was applied by reference to the modified look-back period; that is, the period beginning on the date in which a material chance in circumstances occurred and ending on the last day of the PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale. For this purpose, the reduction in PRS's U.S. business in year 3, coupled with the creation of the Country B Business in the same year, qualifies as a material change in circumstances. Thus, the modified look-back period consists of year 3; that is, the period starting at the beginning of year 3, the date in which the material change in circumstances occurred, and ending of the last day of year 3, the last day of PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale. Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years preceding the deemed sale, the foreign source inventory ratio, expressed as a percentage, is 50% ($15x attributable to PRS's gross income from sources without the United States with respect to sales of its inventory property, over $30x attributable to PRS's total gross income with respect to sales of its inventory property). Due to the material change in circumstances, however, 95% of PRS's inventory property is sold in its Foreign Businesses. ($9.5x attributable to PRS's gross income from sources without the United States with respect to sales of its inventory property, over $10x attributable to PRS's total gross income with respect to sales of its inventory property.) Accordingly, if PRS applied the sourcing rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by reference to the modified look-back period, 95% ($9.5x/$10x), or $9.5x, of the gain would be attributable to sales for PRS's Foreign Businesses (gain from sources without the United States), and only 5% ($.5x/$10x), or $0.5x, of the gain would be attributable to sales for PRS's U.S. Business (gain from United States sources). The excess of the foreign source inventory ratio determined by reference to the modified look-back period (expressed as a percentage), over the foreign source inventory ratio (also expressed as a percentage) is 45%; that is 95% (as determined under the modified look-back period) minus 50% (as determined under the foreign source inventory ratio). Accordingly, the sourcing results are materially different because the 45 percentage point difference is greater than the 30 percentage point threshold provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section. Thus, the material change in circumstances rule of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section applies and the foreign source inventory gain determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, determined by reference to the modified look-back period, is $9.5x; that is, the deemed sale gain attributable to inventory property ($10x), multiplied by the foreign source inventory ratio determined by reference to the modified look-back period ($9.5x/$10x).
