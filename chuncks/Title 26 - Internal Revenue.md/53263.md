###### ยง 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Life consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks.

(ii)The life consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks for the life subgroup are determined by applying the principles of ยง 1.1502-22 as modified by the following rules in this paragraph (g)(3)(ii):

(A) Life consolidated net capital loss is first carried back (or apportioned to the life members for separate return years) to be absorbed by life consolidated capital gain net income without regard to any nonlife subgroup capital losses and before the life consolidated net capital loss may serve as a life subgroup capital loss that sets off nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in the year the life consolidated net capital loss arose.

(B) If a life consolidated net capital loss is not carried back or is not a life subgroup loss that sets off nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in the year the life consolidated net capital loss arose, then it is carried over to the particular year under this paragraph (g)(3)(ii) first against life consolidated capital gain net income before it may serve as a life subgroup capital loss that sets off nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in that particular year.
