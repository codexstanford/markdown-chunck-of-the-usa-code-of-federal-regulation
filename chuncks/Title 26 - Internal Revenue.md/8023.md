####### Analysis.

(B)UTP has entered into an arrangement with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules of section 163(j) or the regulations in this part under section 163(j). Thus, under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the Commissioner of the IRS may disregard or recharacterize this transaction to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of section 163(j). In this case, UTP's share of gross deductions from LTP may be recharacterized as gross deductions incurred directly by UTP solely for purposes of computing UTP's ATI.
