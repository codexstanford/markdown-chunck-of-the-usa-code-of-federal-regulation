####### Requirements for deductions.

(d)(1) In order for any amount paid by the acquiring corporation (other than amounts deductible under section 404(a)(5)) to be deductible by the acquiring corporation by reason of this section in respect of a trust or nontrusteed annuity plan which is established by a distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation, the contributions must be paid (or deemed to have been paid under section 404(a)(6)) by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year of that corporation which ends with or within a year of the trust for which it is exempt under section 501(a), or, in the case of a nontrusteed annuity plan, for which it meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2). See, however, section 404(a)(4) and ยง 1.404(a)-11 for rules relating to deductions for contributions to foreign-situs trusts. The trust or plan which is established by the distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation may separately satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) or section 404(a)(2) or may, together with other trusts or plans of the acquiring corporation, constitute a single plan which qualifies under section 401(a) or meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2).

(2) Excess contributions paid under a qualified trust or plan established by the transferor or distributor corporation may be carried over and, subject to the applicable limitations, deducted by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer regardless of whether the trust is exempt, or the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2), during such taxable year. There are, however, special rules for computing the limitations on the amount of excess contributions which are deductible in a taxable year ending after the trust or plan has terminated (see paragraph (a) of ยง 1.404(a)-13). For this purpose, the pension, annuity, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan of the distributor or transferor corporation under which the excess contributions were made shall be considered continued (and not terminated) by the acquiring corporation if, after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation continues the plan as a separate and distinct plan of its own which continues to qualify under section 401(a), or to meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2), or consolidates or replaces that plan with a comparable plan. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules relating to what constitutes a "comparable" plan.

(3) In order for any amount paid by the acquiring corporation to be deductible by the acquiring corporation as an unused deduction carried over from a qualified profit-sharing or stock bonus trust established by a distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation must continue such trust established by the distributor or transferor corporation as a separate and distinct trust of its own which continues to qualify under section 401(a), or must consolidate or replace that trust with a comparable trust. In addition, the amount paid by the acquiring corporation will be deductible as an unused deduction carried over from the transferor or distributor corporation only if it is paid into the profit-sharing or stock bonus trust established by the transferor or distributor corporation, or the comparable trust, in a taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends with or within a year of such trust (or such comparable trust) for which it meets the requirements of section 401(a) and is exempt under section 501(a). See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules relating to what constitutes a "comparable" trust.

(4) For purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, a plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of section 404(a) shall be considered comparable to another plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to either of those paragraphs, and a plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 404(a) shall be considered comparable to another plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to such paragraph (3). Thus, a profit-sharing plan (which qualifies under section 401(a)) established by the transferor or distributor corporation shall, for purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, be considered terminated if, after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation transfers the funds accumulated under the profit-sharing plan into a pension plan covering the same employees. In such a case, excess contributions paid under the profit-sharing plan by the distributor or transferor corporation may be carried over and deducted by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer subject to the limitations in section 404(a)(3)(A). On the other hand, unused deductions attributable to the profit sharing plan may not be carried over and used by the acquiring corporation as a basis for deducting amounts contributed by it to the pension plan.
