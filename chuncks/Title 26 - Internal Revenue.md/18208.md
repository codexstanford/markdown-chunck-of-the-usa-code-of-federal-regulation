###### ยง 1.381(c)(1)-1 Net operating loss carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
####### Limitation on net operating loss deduction for first taxable year ending after date of distribution or transfer.

(d)(1) That part of the acquiring corporation's net operating loss deduction, determined in accordance with sections 172(a) and 381(c)(1), for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer which is attributable to the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation, is limited by section 381(c)(1)(B) and this paragraph to an amount equal to the acquiring corporation's postacquisition part year taxable income. Such postacquisition part year taxable income is the amount which bears the same ratio to the acquiring corporation's taxable income for the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer (determined under section 63 without regard to any net operating loss deduction but taking into account other items to which the acquiring corporation succeeds under section 381) as the number of days in such first taxable year which follow the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in such taxable year. Thus, if the date of distribution or transfer is the last day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year, the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor are allowed in full in computing under section 172(a) the net operating loss deduction of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after that date. In such instance, the number of days in the first taxable year which follow the date of distribution or transfer is the total number of days in such taxable year.

(2) The limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) applies solely for the purpose of computing the net operating loss deduction of the acquiring corporation under section 172(a) for the acquiring corporation's first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer. The limitation does not apply for purposes of determining the portion of any net operating loss (whether of the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation) which may be carried to any taxable year of the acquiring corporation following its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer since such determination is made pursuant to section 172(b) and section 381(c)(1)(C). See paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

(3) The limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be applied to the aggregate of the allowable net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation without reference to the taxable years in which the net operating losses were sustained by such corporation. If the acquiring corporation has acquired the assets of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on the same date of distribution or transfer, then the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be applied to the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers from all of such distributor or transferor corporations.

(4) If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more different dates of distribution or transfer within one taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the limitation to be applied under section 381(c)(1)(B) to the aggregate of such carryovers shall be governed by the rules prescribed in paragraph (b) of ยง 1.381(c)(1)-2.
