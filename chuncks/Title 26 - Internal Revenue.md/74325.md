####### Residence of a trust,In general.

(d)-(1)(i) The State of residence of a trust shall be determined by reference to the circumstances of the individual who, by either an inter-vivos transfer or a testamentary transfer, is deemed to be the "principal contributor" to the trust under the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.

(ii) If only one individual has ever contributed assets to the trust, including the assets which were transferred to the trust at its inception, then such individual is the principal contributor to the trust. However, if on any day subsequent to the initial creation of the trust, such trust receives assets having a value greater than the aggregate value of all assets theretofore contributed to it, then the trust shall be deemed (for the limited purpose of determining the State of residence) to have been "created" anew, and the individual who on the day of such creation contributed more (in value) than any other individual contributed on that day shall become the principal contributor to the trust. When a trust is created anew, all references in this paragraph to the creation of the trust shall be construed as referring to the most recent creation. For purposes of this paragraph, the value of any asset shall be its fair market value on the day that it was contributed to the trust; any subsequent appreciation or depreciation in the value of the asset shall be disregarded.
