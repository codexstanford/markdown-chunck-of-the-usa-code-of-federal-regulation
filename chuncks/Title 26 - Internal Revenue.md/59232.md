####### Adjustment for part of terms-letter reserve applicable to property disposed of on or after changeover date and before 1956 adjustment date.

(c)Pursuant to subsection (d)(2) of the Act, an adjustment to the basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for that part of the terms-letter reserve which was applicable to any retirement-straight line property disposed of by sale, casualty, or abnormal retirement in the nature of special obsolescence, but only if the sale occurred in, or a deduction by reason of such casualty or abnormal retirement was allowed for Federal income-tax purposes for a period on or after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date. This paragraph shall apply even though, in computing the adjusted basis of the property for purposes of determining gain or loss on the sale, casualty, or abnormal retirement, the basis of the retirement-straight line property was not reduced by the part of the terms-letter reserve applicable to the property. If necessary, the adjustment required by this paragraph shall be allocated, in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, among all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date.
