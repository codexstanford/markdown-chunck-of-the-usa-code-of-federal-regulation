(3)If a controlled foreign corporation for a taxable year has more than one class of stock outstanding on the hypothetical distribution date, the amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to each class of stock is determined based on the distribution rights of each class of stock on the hypothetical distribution date, which amount is then further distributed pro rata with respect to each share in the class of stock. Subject to paragraphs (e)(4) through (6) of this section, the distribution rights of a class of stock are determined taking into account all facts and circumstances related to the economic rights and interest in the allocable earnings and profits of the corporation of each class, including the terms of the class of stock, any agreement among the shareholders and, if and to the extent appropriate, the relative fair market value of shares of stock. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), facts and circumstances do not include actual distributions (including distributions by redemption) or any amount treated as a dividend under any other provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under section 78, 356(a)(2), 367(b), or 1248) made during the taxable year that includes the hypothetical distribution date.
