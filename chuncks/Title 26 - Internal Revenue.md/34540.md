()For purposes of apportioning deductions where section 904 is the operative section, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section, $305x of USP's gross income attributable to its GILTI inclusion amount is exempt income. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section, the GILTI inclusion stock of CFC1 is the $6,100x of stock that is section 951A category stock and the GILTI inclusion stock of CFC2 is the $4,880x of stock that is section 951A category stock. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section, the portion of the value of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 that is treated as an exempt asset equals the portion of the value of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 that is GILTI inclusion stock multiplied by 50% ($305x/$610x). Accordingly, the exempt portion of the stock of CFC1 is $3,050x (50% x $6,100x) and the exempt portion of CFC2's stock is $2,440x (50% x $4,880x). Therefore, the stock of CFC1 taken into account for purposes of apportioning deductions is $3,050x of non-exempt section 951A category stock and $3,900x of general category stock. The stock of CFC2 taken into account for purposes of apportioning deductions is $2,440x of non-exempt section 951A category stock and $4,120x of general category stock.
