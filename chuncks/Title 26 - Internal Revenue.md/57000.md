###### ยง 1.6050E-1 Reporting of State and local income tax refunds.
####### When credit or offset deemed allowed.

(g)For purposes of a return of information under this section, a credit or offset is deemed to be allowed when the liability to pay or credit such amount is admitted by the State or local taxing jurisdiction. Thus, if an amount with respect to a taxpayer's 1982 taxable year is credited in 1983 to reduce the liability of the taxpayer to make estimated tax payments in 1983, it is reportable as a credit allowed in 1983. It is not reportable in the taxable year that gives rise to the refund, credit or offset.
