() In the event any WIN employee described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is paid wages (as defined in section 50B(b) and paragraph (b) of ยง 1.50B-1) by such electing corporation, which are less than the wages paid to other employees of such electing corporation who perform comparable services (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of ยง 1.50A-3), during a taxable year of the corporation for which the election under section 1372 is effective, each signer agrees to notify the district director or the director of the Internal Revenue service center of such failure to pay equal wages for comparable services, and agrees to be jointly and severally liable to pay to the district director or the director of the Internal Revenue service center an amount equal to the increase in tax which would have been imposed by ยง 1.50A-3 on the corporation as a result of such failure but for the election under section 1372.

(ii) The agreement shall set forth the name, address, and taxpayer account number of each party and the internal revenue district or service center in which each such party files his or its income tax return for the taxable year which includes the last day of the corporation's taxable year immediately preceding the first taxable year for which the election under section 1372 is effective. The agreement may be signed on behalf of the corporation by any person who is duly authorized. The agreement shall be filed with the district director or the director of the Internal Revenue service center with whom the corporation files its income tax return for its taxable year immediately preceding the first taxable year for which the election under section 1372 is effective and shall be filed on or before the due date (including extensions of time) of such return. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the district director or the director of the Internal Revenue service center may, if good cause is shown, permit the agreement to be filed on a later date.
