####### Amount of dividends paid deduction allowable-(a) General rule.

(ii)In the case of distributions in liquidation with respect to which a deduction for dividends paid is permissible under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the amount of the deduction is equal to the part of such distribution which is properly chargeable to the earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913. To determine the amount properly chargeable to the earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913, there must be deducted from the amount of the distribution that part allocable to capital account. The capital account, for the purposes of this subdivision, includes not only amounts representing the par or stated value of the stock with respect to which the liquidation distribution is made, but also that stock's proper share of the paid-in surplus, and such other corporate items, if any, which, for purposes of income taxation, are treated like capital in that they are not taxable dividends when distributed but are applied against and reduce the basis of the stock. The remainder of the distribution in liquidation is, ordinarily, properly chargeable to the earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913. Thus, if there is a deficit in earnings and profits on the first day of a taxable year, and the earnings and profits for such taxable year do not exceed such deficit, no dividends paid deduction would be allowed for such taxable year with respect to a distribution in liquidation; if the earnings and profits for such taxable year exceed the deficit in earnings and profits which existed on the first day of such taxable year, then a dividends paid deduction would be allowed to the extent of such excess.
