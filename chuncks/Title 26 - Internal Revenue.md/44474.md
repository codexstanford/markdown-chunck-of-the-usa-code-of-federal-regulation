####### Application of section 1059A to property having dutiable and nondutiable portions.

(4)When an item of imported property is subiect to a duty upon the full value of the imported article, less the cost or value of American goods returned, and the taxpayer claims a basis or inventory cost greater than the customs value reported for the item, the claimed tax basis or inventory cost in the dutiable portion of the item is limited under section 1059A and this section to the customs value of the dutiable portion under paragraph (c)(1). The claimed tax basis or inventory cost in the nondutiable portion of the item is determined by multiplying the customs value of the nondutiable portion by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount by which the claimed basis or inventory cost of the item exceeds the customs value of the item and the denominator of which is the customs value of the item and adding this amount to the customs value of the nondutiable portion of the item. The claimed tax basis or inventory cost in the dutiable portion is determined by multiplying the customs value of the dutiable portion by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount by which the claimed basis or inventory cost of the item exceeds the customs value of the item and the denominator of which is the customs value of the item and adding this amount to the customs value of the dutiable portion of the item. However, the taxpayer may not claim a tax basis or inventory cost in the dutiable portion greater than the customs value of this portion of the item.
