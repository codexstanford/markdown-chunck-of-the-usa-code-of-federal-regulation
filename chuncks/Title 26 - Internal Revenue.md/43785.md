()As provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, B and L must apply the rule in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to determine whether the fallback rate is a qualified rate. Because it is not possible to determine at the time of the fallback rate's addition in 2022 whether the fallback rate (the replacement rate that B will select in 2023) satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the fallback rate is treated as not satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, the fallback rate is not a qualified rate.
