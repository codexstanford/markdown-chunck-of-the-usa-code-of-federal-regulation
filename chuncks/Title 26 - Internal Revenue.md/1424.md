()The determination of whether an owner is a low-income person must be made at the time the qualified low-income community investment is made, or at the time the ownership interest is acquired by the owner, whichever is later. If an owner is a low-income person at the time the qualified low-income community investment is made or at the time the ownership interest is acquired by the owner, whichever is later, that owner is considered a low-income person for purposes of section 45D(e)(2) and this paragraph (d)(9) throughout the time the ownership interest is held by that owner.
