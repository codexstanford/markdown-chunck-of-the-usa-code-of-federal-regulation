####### Example 5: Allocation of a CNOL arising in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 2021.,1,2

(E)The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D)() of this section, except that the P group incurred the CNOL during the P group's 2020 consolidated return year. The allocation among the P group members of the CNOL described in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D)() of this section would be the same. However, those respective portions of the CNOL attributable to PC1, PC2, and PC3 (that is, members that are nonlife insurance companies) will be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years and then carried over to each of the 20 subsequent taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(C) and section 172(b)(1)(D)(i). The portion attributable to P (which is not a nonlife insurance company) will be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years and then carried over to future years. See section 172(b)(1)(A) and section 172(b)(1)(D)(i).
