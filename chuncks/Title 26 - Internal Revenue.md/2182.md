####### Transfers by reason of death,General rule.

(b)-(1)Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2, relating to "disposition" and "cessation", paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to a transfer of section 38 property by reason of the death of the taxpayer. Thus, for example, with respect to section 38 property held in joint tenancy, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to the transfer of the deceased taxpayer's interest to the surviving joint tenant. If, under § 1.48-4, the lessor of new section 38 property made a valid election to treat the lessee as having purchased such property for purposes of the credit allowed by section 38, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 does not apply if, by reason of the death of the lessee, there is a termination of the lease and transfer of the leased property to the lessor, or there is an assignment of the lease and transfer of the leased property to another person. Moreover, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 does not apply to the transfer of a partner's interest in a partnership, a beneficiary's interest in an estate or trust, or shares of stock of a shareholder of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)) by reason of the death of such partner, beneficiary, or shareholder. Paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to property prior to his death even if the value of such gift is included in his gross estate for estate tax purposes (such as, a gift in contemplation of death under section 2035). The effect of this subparagraph is that any section 38 property held by a taxpayer at the time of his death is deemed to have been held by him for its entire estimated useful life.
