# Title 26 - Internal Revenue
## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### ยง 1.162-33 Certain employee remuneration in excess of $1,000,000 not deductible for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
####### Conclusion.

(B)If this section applies, Employee B is a covered employee for Corporation Z's 2019 taxable year. Because the October 2, 2017, agreement is a written binding contract to pay Employee B $3,000,000 if the applicable conditions are met, this section does not apply (and ยง 1.162-27 does apply) to the deduction for the $3,000,000 regardless of whether Corporation Z's financial statements are restated to show that its net earnings did not increase by at least 10%, and regardless of whether Corporation Z exercises its discretion to recover the bonus if Corporation Z's financial statements are restated to show that its net earnings did not increase by at least 10%.
