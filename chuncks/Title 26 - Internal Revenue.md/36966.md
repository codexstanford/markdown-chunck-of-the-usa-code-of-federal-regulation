###### ยง 1.892-5T Controlled commercial entity (temporary regulations).
####### Parent/subsidiary entities,Subsidiary to parent attribution.

(2)-(i)Commercial activities of a subsidiary controlled entity are not attributed to its parent. Thus, investment income described in ยง 1.892-3T that is derived by a parent controlled entity that is not itself engaged in commercial activity within or outside the United States is exempt from taxation notwithstanding the fact that its subsidiary is a controlled commercial entity. Dividends or other payments of income received by the parent controlled entity from the subsidiary are not exempt under section 892, because it constitutes income received from a controlled commercial entity. Furthermore, dividends paid by the parent are not exempt to the extent attributable to the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiary. Thus, a distribution by the parent shall be exempt only to the extent such distribution exceeds earnings and profits attributable to the dividend received from its subsidiary.
