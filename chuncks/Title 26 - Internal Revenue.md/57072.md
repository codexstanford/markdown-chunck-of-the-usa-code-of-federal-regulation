(3)An interest recipient that designates a qualified person to satisfy the reporting requirements described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must make that designation in a written designation agreement. The designation agreement must identify the mortgage(s) and calendar years for which the designated qualified person must report, and must be signed by both the designator and designee. A designee may report an amount as having been paid directly by the payor of record (for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section) only if the designation agreement contains the designator's representation that it did not lend such amount to the payor of record as part of the overall transaction. The designator must retain a copy of the designation agreement for four years following the close of the calendar year in which the loan is made. The designation agreement need not be filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
