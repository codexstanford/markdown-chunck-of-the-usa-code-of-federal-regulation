####### Annualized fixed rent.

(3)Annualized fixed rent is determined by multiplying the fixed rent allocated to the rental period under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section by the number of periods of the rental period's length in a calendar year. Thus, if the fixed rent allocated to a rental period is $10,000 and the rental period is one month, the annualized fixed rent for that rental period is $120,000 ($10,000 times 12).
