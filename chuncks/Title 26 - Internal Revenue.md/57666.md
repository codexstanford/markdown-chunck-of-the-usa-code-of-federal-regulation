(a)In the case of an individual on the fiscal year basis, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 4th month of the taxable year. If, however, the requirements of section 6015(a) are first met after the 1st day of the 4th month and before the 2d day of the 6th month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 6th month of the taxable year. If such requirements are first met after the 1st day of the 6th month, and before the 2d day of the 9th month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 9th month of the taxable year. If such requirements are first met after the 1st day of the 9th month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 1st month of the succeeding fiscal year. Thus, if an individual taxpayer has a fiscal year ending on June 30, 1956, his declaration must be filed on or before October 15, 1955, if the requirements of section 6015(a) are met on or before October 1, 1955. If, however, such requirements are not met until after October 1, 1955, and before December 2, 1955, the declaration need not be filed until December 15, 1955.
