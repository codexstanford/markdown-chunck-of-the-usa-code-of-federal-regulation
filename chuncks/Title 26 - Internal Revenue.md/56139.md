The information return shall show the aggregate amount of the dividends, the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person on whose behalf the dividends are received, the amount of tax deducted and withheld under section 3406 from the dividends, if any, and such other information as required by the forms. An information return is generally not required if the amount of the dividends received on behalf of the other person during the calendar year aggregates less than $10. However, a return of information is not required under this section if-

(A) The record owner is, pursuant to section 6012(a) (3) or (4) and § 1.6012-3, required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 that is filed for the estate or trust disclosing the name, address, and identifying number of both the record owner and actual owner and furnishes Form K-1 to each actual owner containing the information required to be shown on the form, including amounts withheld under section 3406;

(C) The record owner is a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, or a nominee thereof, and the actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for which such banking institution or trust company files an annual return but only if the name, address, and identifying number of the record owner are included on or with the annual return filed for the tax exempt organization).

(iii) Every person who is a nominee acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of § 1.851-7 who, during a calendar year after 1968, receives payments of dividends in such capacity, shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099, for such calendar year showing the information required by such forms and instructions thereto and the name, address, and identifying number of the nominee identified as such. This subdivision shall not apply if the regulated investment company agrees with the nominee to satisfy the requirements of section 6042 and the regulations thereunder with respect to each holder of an interest in the unit investment trust whose shares are being held by the nominee as custodian and within the time limit for furnishing statements prescribed by § 1.6042-4, files with the Internal Revenue Service office where such company's return is to be filed for the taxable year, a statement that the holders of the unit investment trust with whom the agreement was made have been directly notified by the regulated investment company. Such statement shall include the name, sponsor, and custodian of each unit investment trust whose holders have been directly notified. The nominee's requirements under this subdivision shall be deemed met if the regulated investment company transmits a copy of such statement to the nominee within such period; provided, however, if the regulated investment company fails or is unable to satisfy the requirements of section 6042 with respect to the holders of interest in the unit investment trust, it shall so notify the Internal Revenue Service within 45 days following the close of its taxable year. The custodian shall, upon notice by the Internal Revenue Service that the regulated investment company has failed to comply with the agreement, satisfy the requirements of this subdivision within 30 days of such notice.
