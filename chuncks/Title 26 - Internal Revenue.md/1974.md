####### Change in method.

(v)The choice between the general rule and carryover option methods of determining the additional credit attributable to applicable years is made with respect to each year's qualified investment, and does not bind the corporation with respect to selection of methods for the additional credit attributable to other years' qualified investment. A failure to comply does not occur merely because a corporation elects to apply either method for the additional credit attributable to separate years' qualified investment.
