(iii) The remaining $10,000 amount of the transfer to K that exceeds K's allocable share of the liability is tested to determine whether an exception under ยง 1.707-4 applies. Because $10,000 of the payment to K is a reasonable guaranteed payment for capital under ยง 1.707-4(a)(1)(ii), the $10,000 transfer will not be treated as part of a sale by K of propertyto the partnership under ยง 1.707-3.
