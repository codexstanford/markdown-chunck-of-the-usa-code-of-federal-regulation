####### § 31.3121(g)-1 Agricultural labor.
######## Services described in section 3121(g)(5).

(f)(1) Service not in the course of the employer's trade or business (see paragraph (a)(1) of § 31.3121(a)(7)-1) or domestic service in a private home of the employer (see paragraph (a)(2) of § 31.3121(a)(7)-1) constitutes agricultural labor if such service is performed on a farm operated for profit. The determination whether remuneration for any such service performed on a farm operated for profit constitutes wages is to be made under § 31.3121(a)(8)-1 rather than under § 31.3121(a)(7)-1. For provisions relating to the exception from employment provided with respect to any such service performed after 1960 by a father or mother in the employ of his or her son or daughter, see § 31.3121(b)(3)-1.

(2) Generally, a farm is not operated for profit if it is occupied by the employer primarily for residential purposes, or is used primarily for the pleasure of the employer or his family such as for the entertainment of guests or as a hobby of the employer or his family.
