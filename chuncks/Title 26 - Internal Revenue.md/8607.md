####### Application of look-through rules.

(ii)If a taxpayer that applies the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section has a different taxable year than the partnership or non-consolidated C corporation to which the taxpayer is applying those rules, then, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), the taxpayer must use the most recent asset basis figures from the partnership or non-consolidated C corporation. For example, assume that PS1 is a partnership with a May 31 taxable year, and that C (a calendar-year C corporation that is ineligible to use the annual determination method for the taxable year) is a partner in PS1. PS1's determination dates are February 28, May 31, August 31, and November 30. In turn, C's determination dates are March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. If C looks through to PS1's basis in its assets under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, then, for purposes of determining the amount of C's asset basis that is attributable to its excepted and non-excepted businesses on March 31, C must use PS1's asset basis calculations for February 28.
