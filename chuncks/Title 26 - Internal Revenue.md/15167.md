####### Cohan v. Commissioner,,entertainment,expenditure

(4) Any listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4) and ยง 1.280F-6T(b)), unless the taxpayer substantiates each element of the expenditure or use (as described in paragraph (b) of this section) in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This limitation supersedes the doctrine found in39 F. 2d 540 (2d Cir. 1930). The decision held that, where the evidence indicated a taxpayer incurred deductible travel or entertainment expenses but the exact amount could not be determined, the court should make a close approximation and not disallow the deduction entirely. Section 274(d) contemplates that no deduction or credit shall be allowed a taxpayer on the basis of such approximations or unsupported testimony of the taxpayer. For purposes of this section, the termmeans entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and use of a facility therefor; and the termincludes expenses and items (including items such as losses and depreciation).
