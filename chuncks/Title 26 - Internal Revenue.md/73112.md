####### ยง 301.6225-3 Treatment of partnership adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.
######## Adjustments to items that are not items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit.

(8)The partnership takes into account an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment that resulted from an adjustment to an item that is not an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit by adjusting the item on its adjustment year return but only to the extent the item would appear on the adjustment year return without regard to the adjustment. If the item is already reflected on the partnership's adjustment year return as an item that is not an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, or in any year between the reviewed year and the adjustment year, a partnership should not create a new item in the amount of the adjustment on the partnership's adjustment year return.
