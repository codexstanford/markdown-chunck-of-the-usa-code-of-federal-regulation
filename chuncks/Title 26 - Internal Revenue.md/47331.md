###### § 1.1313(a)-3 Final disposition of claim for refund as a determination.
####### Items applied by the Commissioner in reduction of the refund or credit.

(d)If the Commissioner applies an item in reduction of the overpayment alleged in the claim for refund, and the net result is an allowance of refund or credit, the disposition with respect to the item so applied by the Commissioner becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed by section 6532 for instituting suit on the claim for refund, unless suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period. If such application of the item results in the assertion of a deficiency, such action does not constitute a final disposition of a claim for refund within the meaning of § 1.1313(a)-3, but subsequent action taken with respect to such deficiency may result in a determination under §§ 1.1313(a)-1, 1.1313(a)-2, or 1.1313(a)-4.
