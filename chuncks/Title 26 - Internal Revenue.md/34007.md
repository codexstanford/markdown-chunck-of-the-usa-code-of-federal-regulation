(2)-(i)In the case of taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, rent attributable to personal property that is leased under, or in connection with, the lease of real property is treated under section 856(d)(1)(C) as "rents from real property" (and thus qualified for purposes of the income source requirements) if the rent attributable to the personal property is not more than 15 percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year. If, however, the rent attributable to personal property is greater than 15 percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year, then the portion of the rent from the lease that is attributable to personal property will not qualify as "rents from real property".
