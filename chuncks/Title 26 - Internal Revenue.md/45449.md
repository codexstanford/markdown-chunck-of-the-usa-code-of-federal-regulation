####### Certain tangible property.

(3)If:

(i) A person disposes of section 1245 property in a transaction to which section 1245(b)(4) applies,

(ii) Adjustments are reflected in the adjusted basis (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of ยง 1.1245-2) of such property which are attributable to the use of such property (or other property) as an integral part of an activity, or as a facility, specified in section 1245(a)(3)(B) (i) or (ii), and

(iii) Property is acquired in the transaction which would be considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B) if such person used the acquired property as an integral part of such an activity, or as such a facility, then (regardless of the use of the acquired property) the acquired property shall be considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B). For definition of property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B), see paragraph (c) of ยง 1.1245-3. Thus, for example, if a person's section 1245 property (which is personal property) is involuntarily converted into property A which would qualify as section 1245 property only if it were devoted to a specified use, and if the person had so devoted the section 1245 property disposed of, then the acquired property is considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B) and therefore its fair market value is not taken into account under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. For recomputed basis of property A, see paragraph (a)(5) of ยง 1.1245-2. Moreover, if property A is not devoted to a specified use and is subsequently involuntarily converted into property B which would qualify as section 1245 property only if it were so devoted, then property B is also considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B).
