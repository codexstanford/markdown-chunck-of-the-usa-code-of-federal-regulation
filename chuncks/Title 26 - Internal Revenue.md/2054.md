####### Change of employer security status.

(6)In general, a transaction changing the status of a corporation as an employer, or as a member of a controlled group of corporations including the employer, adversely affects the status as employer securities of common stock and securities held by a plan ("old employer securities"). However, to the extent that the transaction causing the change in status of the old employer securities does not result in a recapture under section 47 of any investment credit underlying the transfer to, or acquisition by, the plan of the old employer securities, common stock and securities ("new employer securities") substituted for old employer securities are treated as if they were the old employer securities if-

(i) The plan is not terminated,

(ii) The old employer securities and the new employer securities are of equal value at the time of the transaction changing the status of the old employer securities, and

(iii) The new employer securities otherwise meet the requirements of this section.
