####### Treatment of net operating losses incurred in post-2017 taxable years that are carried back to pre-2018 taxable years,In general.

(5)-(i)Except as provided in paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this section, a net operating loss incurred in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (a "post-2017 taxable year"), which is carried back, pursuant to section 172, to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018 (a "pre-2018 carryback year"), will be carried back under the rules of ยง 1.904(g)-3(b). For purposes of applying the rules of ยง 1.904(g)-3(b), income in a pre-2018 separate category in the taxable year to which the net operating loss is carried back is treated as if it included only income that would be assigned to the post-2017 general category. Therefore, any separate limitation loss created by reason of a passive category component of a net operating loss from a post-2017 taxable year that is carried back to offset general category income in a pre-2018 carryback year will be recaptured in post-2017 taxable years as general category income, and not as a combination of general, foreign branch, and section 951A category income.
