####### Reasonable expenses incurred to make covered modifications.

(4)An interest in a REMIC does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because it is subject to a contingency whereby the amount of payments of principal or interest (or other similar amounts) with respect to the interest in the REMIC is reduced by reasonable costs incurred to effect a covered modification. In addition, payment by a party other than the REMIC of reasonable costs incurred to effect a covered modification is not a contribution to the REMIC for purposes of section 860G(d).
