####### Analysis.

(ii)For purposes of the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund and S2 are an organization or arrangement that is treated as a single entity under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and an eligible fund under paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to the qualified segregated account held by Fund. Because the eligible fund composed of Fund and S2 satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section (including the rule under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section that each entity satisfy the foreign organization requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) with respect to the qualified benefits provided to the qualified recipients out of the eligible fund's qualified segregated account (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section), the eligible fund that is composed of Fund and S2 constitutes a qualified foreign pension fund. Furthermore, the requirements for qualified holder status are satisfied, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Thus, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $100x gain attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).
