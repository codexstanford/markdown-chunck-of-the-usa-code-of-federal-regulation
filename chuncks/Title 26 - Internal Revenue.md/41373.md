###### § 1.960-1 Overview, definitions, and computational rules for determining foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 960(a), (b), and (d).
####### Step 2,1,Allocation and apportionment of deductions for expenses other than taxes.

(B)-()Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, CFC1's deductions for the current taxable year are allocated and apportioned among the section 904 categories, income groups within a section 904 category, and any PTEP groups that were increased as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T, 750,000u of deductions are allocated and apportioned to the residual income group within the general category, and 750,000u of deductions are allocated and apportioned to the subpart F income group within the passive category. Therefore, CFC1 has 1,250,000u (2,000,000u-750,000u) of pre-tax income attributable to the residual income group within the general category and 1,250,000u (2,000,000u-750,000u) of pre-tax income attributable to the subpart F income group within the passive category. For U.S. tax purposes, no deductions other than eligible current year taxes are allocated and apportioned to the 4,000,000u in CFC1's PTEP group.
