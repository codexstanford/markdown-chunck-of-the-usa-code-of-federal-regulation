####### Recuperators.

(4)Recuperators recover energy, usually in the form of waste heat from combustion exhaust gases, hot exiting product, or product cooling air, that is used to heat incoming combustion air, raw materials, or fuel. Recuperators are configurations of equipment consisting in part of fixed heat transfer surfaces between two gas flows, and include related baffles, dividers, entrance flanges, transition sections, and shells or cases enclosing the other components of the recuperator. In general, a fixed heat transfer surface absorbs heat from a gas or liquid flow or dissipates heat to the gas or liquid flow.
