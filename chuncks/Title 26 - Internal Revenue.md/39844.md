####### Loans through certain financial intermediaries.

(iv)A loan by a qualified financial institution shall not be disqualified from being an investment in active business assets or in a development project merely because the proceeds are first lent to a financial intermediary (as defined in paragraph (c)(8)(iv)(H) of this section) which, in turn, on-lends the proceeds directly to a qualified recipient, provided the requirements of this paragraph (c)(8)(iv) are satisfied.

(A) The loan to the qualified recipient must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section in the case of an investment in active business assets, or of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section in the case of an investment in a development project.

(B) The qualified recipient and the active business assets or development project in which the proceeds are to be invested must be identified prior to disbursement of any part of the proceeds by the qualified financial institution to the financial intermediary.
