####### Change in corporation's tax status treated as asset transfer.

(2)Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (b) of this section, a taxable corporation's change in status to a tax-exempt entity will be treated as if it transferred all of its assets to a tax-exempt entity immediately before the change in status becomes effective in a transaction to which paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies. For example, if a State, a political subdivision thereof, or an entity any portion of whose income is excluded from gross income under section 115, acquires the stock of a taxable corporation and thereafter any of the taxable corporation's income is excluded from gross income under section 115, the taxable corporation will be treated as if it transferred all of its assets to a tax-exempt entity immediately before the stock acquisition.
