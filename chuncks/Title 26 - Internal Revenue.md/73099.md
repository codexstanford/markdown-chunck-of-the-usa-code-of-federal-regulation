####### ยง 301.6225-2 Modification of imputed underpayment.
######## Example 6.,Example 3

(6)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (f)(3) of this section, except that in addition to the modification with respect to tax-exempt entity C, which reduced the imputed underpayment by excluding from the determination of the imputed underpayment $25 of the $100 partnership adjustment reflected in the NOPPA, Partnership timely requests modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to an amended return filed by individual D, and, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, Partnership's partnership representative provides the IRS with documentation demonstrating that D filed the 2019 return and paid all tax and interest due. D's amended return for D's 2019 taxable year takes into account D's share of the partnership adjustment (50 percent of B's 50 percent interest in Partnership, or $25) and D paid the tax and interest due as a result of taking into account D's share of the partnership adjustment in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. No tax attribute in any other taxable year of D is affected by D taking into account D's share of the partnership adjustment for 2019. The IRS approves the modification and the $25 increase in ordinary income allocable to D is not included in the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment (determined in accordance with ยง 301.6225-1). As a result, Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment is $50 ($100, less $25 allocable to C, less $25 taken into account by D), and the imputed underpayment, after modification, is $20.
