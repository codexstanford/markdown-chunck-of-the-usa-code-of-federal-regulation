However, when permitted by the plan, an irrevocable written pledge made in good faith by a participant is treated as a matching employee contribution of cash, whether or not the pledge is in fact contractually binding. The pledge must be to contribute, by no later than a time specified in the TRASOP, a designated amount in cash directly to the plan or indirectly by authorizing the employer to withhold from compensation otherwise due a participant. The specified time may not be later than 24 months after the close of the applicable year for which the amount is treated as a matching employee contribution.
