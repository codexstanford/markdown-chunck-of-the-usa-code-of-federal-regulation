####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the P group may allocate disallowed disqualified interest to Business X and Business Y by either applying the allocation rules of this section in the taxable years in which the disallowed disqualified interest was paid or accrued (the historical approach) or by treating such interest as though it were paid or accrued in the P group's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (the effective date approach). Accordingly, if the P group chooses to rely on the historical approach, it allocates all $120x of disallowed disqualified interest to Business X (a non-excepted trade or business), and all $120x of disallowed disqualified interest is subject to the section 163(j) limitation. If, instead, the P group chooses to rely on the effective date approach, it allocates its $120x of disallowed disqualified interest in the same proportion as its $100x of business interest expense that was paid or accrued in its 2018 taxable year. Of the $120x of disallowed disqualified interest, $30x (25 percent of $120x) is allocated to Business X and $90x (75 percent of $120x) is allocated to Business Y. The $90x of disallowed disqualified interest that is properly allocable to Business Y (an excepted trade or business) is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation.
