(2)If a partnership (upper-tier partnership) assumes a § 1.752-7 liability of a partner, and, subsequently, another partnership (lower-tier partnership) assumes that § 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership, then the § 1.752-7 liability is treated as associated only with any trade or business contributed to the upper-tier partnership by the § 1.752-7 liability partner. The same rule applies where a partnership assumes a § 1.752-7 liability of a partner, and, subsequently, the § 1.752-7 liability partner transfers that partnership interest to another partnership. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii)of this section.
