() P's Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 are not SRLYs with respect to the P group. See ยง 1.1502-1(f)(2)(i). Thus, P's $40 net operating loss arising in Year 1 and $120 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are not subject to the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. Although the P group has $160 of taxable income in Year 4, the 80-percent limitation reduces the P group's net operating loss deduction in that year to $128 ($160 x 80 percent). Under the principles of section 172, paragraph (b) of this section requires that P's $40 loss arising in Year 1 be the first loss absorbed by the P group in Year 4. Absorption of this loss leaves $88 ($128-$40) of the P group's Year 4 consolidated taxable income available for offset by loss carryovers.
