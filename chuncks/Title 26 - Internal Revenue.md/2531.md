(ii)In the case of expenditures attributable to property placed in service before January 1, 1987, and property that qualifies for the transition rules in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) (B) or (C) of this section, the term "qualified rehabilitation expenditure" does not include an expenditure with respect to which an election was not made under section 168(b)(3) as in effect prior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, to use the straight line method of depreciation. In such case, the requirement that an election be made to use straight line cost recovery applies only to the cost recovery of the portion of the basis of a qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures. See section 168(f)(1), as in effect prior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, for rules relating to the use of different methods of cost recovery for different components of a building. In addition, such requirement shall not apply to any expenditure to the extent that section 168(f)(12) or (j), as in effect prior to the amendments made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, applied to such expenditure.
