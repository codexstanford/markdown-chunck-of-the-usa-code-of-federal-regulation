####### Definition of hyperinflationary currency swap contract.

(iv)A hyperinflationary currency swap contract is a currency swap contract that provides for-

(A) Payments denominated in or determined by reference to a currency that is hyperinflationary (as defined in ยง 1.988-1(f)) at the time the taxpayer enters into or otherwise acquires the currency swap; or

(B) Payments that are adjusted to take into account the fact that the currency is hyperinflationary (as defined in ยง 1.988-1(f)) during the current taxable year. A currency swap contract that provides for periodic payments determined by reference to a variable interest rate based on local conditions and generally responding to changes in the local consumer price index is an example of this latter type of currency swap contract.
