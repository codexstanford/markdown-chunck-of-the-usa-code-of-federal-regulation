####### Analysis.

(ii)B's acquisition of Equipment #1 does not satisfy either the No Prior Use Requirement or the Unrelated Party Requirement. Under the Group Prior Use Rule, B is treated as previously having a depreciable interest in Equipment #1 because B (a member of the Parent group) acquired Equipment #1 and S, while a member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #1 within the lookback period. In addition, B acquires Equipment #1 from S, and B and S are Related at the time of the acquisition. Accordingly, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #1 in 2018.
