###### ยง 1.47-7 Rehabilitation credit allocated over a 5-year period.
####### Example 5: Coordination with section 50(d)(5) and ยง 1.50-1; partnership lessee.

(5)A and B, calendar year taxpayers, form a partnership, the AB partnership, that leases nonresidential real property from Y. The property is a qualified rehabilitated building that is placed in service on October 15, 2021. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined is $200,000. Y elects under ยง 1.48-4 to treat the AB partnership as having acquired the property. The shortest recovery period that could be available to the property under section 168 is 39 years. Because Y has elected to treat the AB partnership as having acquired the property, Y does not reduce its basis in the building under section 50(c). Instead, A and B, the ultimate credit claimants, as defined in ยง 1.50-1(b)(3)(ii), must include the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to A and B ratably in gross income over 39 years, the shortest recovery period available with respect to such property.
