####### Gasoline used in the maintenance of a farm or farm equipment.

(g)Gasoline is used "for farming purposes" when it is used by the owner, tenant, or operator of a farm in connection with the operation, management, conservation, improvement, or maintenance of the farm and its tools and equipment. The activities included are those which contribute in any way to the conduct of the farm as such, as distinguished from any other enterprise in which the owner, tenant, or operator may be engaged. Examples of included operations are clearing land, repairing fences and farm buildings, building terraces or irrigation ditches, cleaning tools or farm machinery, and painting farm buildings. Since the gasoline must be used by the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm to which the operations relate, gasoline used by an organization which contracts with a farmer to renovate his farm properties is not used for farming purposes. Gasoline used in a gasoline-powered lawn mower for maintaining a lawn is not used for farming purposes.
