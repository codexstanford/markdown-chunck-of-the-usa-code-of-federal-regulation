####### Example 7. Indirect foreign use-hybrid instrument,Facts.

(7)-(i)P owns DE1which, in turn, owns FS. DE1borrows cash from an unrelated lender and transfers the cash to FSin exchange for an instrument (hybrid instrument). The hybrid instrument is treated as equity for U.S. tax purposes and debt for Country X tax purposes. Interest expense on the loan from the unrelated lender results in a dual consolidated loss being attributable to P's interest in DE1in year 1. DE1does not elect under Country X law to consolidate with FS. In year 1, FSdistributes its stock as a payment on the hybrid instrument to DE1. For U.S. tax purposes, such payment is excluded from P's gross income under section 305. However, for Country X tax purposes, such payment is treated as interest and gives rise to a deduction taken into account in computing FS's Country X tax liability; the payment also gives rise to interest income to DE1for Country X tax purposes.
