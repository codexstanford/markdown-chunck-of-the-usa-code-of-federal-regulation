####### In general.

(a)Under section 856(e) a real estate investment trust may make an irrevocable election to treat as "foreclosure property" certain real property (including interests in real property), and any personal property incident to the real property, acquired by the trust after December 31, 1973. This section prescribes rules relating to the election, including rules relating to property eligible for the election. This section also prescribes rules relating to extensions of the general two-year period (hereinafter the "grace period") during which property retains its status as foreclosure property, as well as rules relating to early termination of the grace period under section 856(e)(4). The election to treat property as foreclosure property does not alter the character of the income derived therefrom (other than for purposes of section 856(c)(2)(F) and (3)(F)). For example, if foreclosure property is sold, the determination of whether it is property described in section 1221(1) will not be affected by the fact that it is foreclosure property.
