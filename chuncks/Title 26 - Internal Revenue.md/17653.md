####### Result.

(B)As a result of the year 5 disposition by TFC of 50% of the TFD stock, under paragraphs (j)(1) and (c)(1)(i) of this section, UST must recognize and include in income 50% of the gain subject to the gain recognition agreement (because of the year 3 disposition of TFC stock, the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement equals 40% of the gain realized, but not recognized, on the initial transfer). UST must pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to the gain recognized. The amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement is reduced by the amount of gain recognized by UST (the remaining gain equals 20% of the gain realized, but not recognized, by UST on the initial transfer).
