(B)Under paragraph (m)(1) of this section, UST must recognize $35x gain under the gain recognition agreement as a result of the year 3 disposition by TFC of the TFD stock. Thus, the amount of gain subject to the new gain recognition agreement entered into by UST pursuant to paragraph (k)(3) of this section is $15x. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, as of the date of the initial transfer, the basis of the TFD stock held by TFC is increased by $35x, the amount of the gain recognized by UST under the gain recognition agreement. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the basis of the TFC stock received by UST in the initial transfer is also increased by $35x. After taking into account the increase to the basis of the TFD stock under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, TFC recognizes $15x gain under section 351(b) in connection with the year 3 transfer of the TFD stock to F1. Under section 362(a), the basis of the TFD stock in the hands of F1 is $100x.
