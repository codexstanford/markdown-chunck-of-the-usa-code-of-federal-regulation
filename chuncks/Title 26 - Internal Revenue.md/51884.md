####### Reporting by territory financial institutions.

(iv)A territory financial institution that is not treated as a U.S. person will not be required to report on Form 1042-S if another withholding agent has reported the same amount with regard to the same recipient for which such entity would otherwise be required to file a return under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) and such withholding agent has withheld the entire amount required to be withheld from such payment. A territory financial institution must, however, report payments made to recipients for whom it has failed to provide the appropriate documentation to another withholding agent or to the extent it knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld. A territory financial institution that is treated as a U.S. person or is otherwise required under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) to report amounts paid to recipients on Forms 1042-S must report in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent.
