##### treatment of excess distributions of trusts applicable to taxable years beginning before january 1, 1969
###### ยง 1.665(b)-2 Exclusions from accumulation distributions in the case of trusts (other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person).
####### Emergency distributions.

(2)The second exclusion from the definition of an accumulation distribution is for amounts properly paid or credited to a beneficiary to meet his emergency needs. Whether or not a distribution falls within this exclusion depends upon the facts and circumstances causing the distribution. A distribution based upon an unforeseen or unforeseeable combination of circumstances requiring immediate help to the beneficiary would qualify for the exclusion. However, the beneficiary must be in actual need of the distribution and the fact that he had other sufficient resources would tend to negate the conclusion that a distribution was to meet his emergency needs. Ordinary distributions for the support, maintenance, or education of the beneficiary would not qualify for the exclusion.
