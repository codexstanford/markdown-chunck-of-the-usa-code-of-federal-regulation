###### ยง 31.3306(c)-3 Employment; excepted services in general.

(a) Services performed by an employee for the person employing him do not constitute employment for purposes of the tax if they are specifically excepted from employment under any of the numbered paragraphs of section 3306(c). Services so excepted do not constitute employment for purposes of the tax even though they are performed within the United States, or are performed outside the United States on or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft. If not otherwise provided in the regulations relating to the numbered paragraphs of section 3306(c), such regulations apply with respect to services performed after 1954.

(b) The exception attaches to the services performed by the employee and not to the employee as an individual; that is, the exception applies only to the services rendered by the employee in an excepted class.

(c) For provisions relating to the circumstances under which services which are excepted are nevertheless deemed to be employment, and relating to the circumstances under which services which are not excepted are nevertheless deemed not to be employment, see ยง 31.3306(d)-1.
