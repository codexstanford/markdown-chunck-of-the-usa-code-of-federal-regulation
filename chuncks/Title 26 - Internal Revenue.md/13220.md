####### Depreciation capitalized to inventory.

(C)Because all of the depreciation with respect to the machine is capitalized to inventory, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine for the taxable year is 80 percent, which is DC's depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory of Product A, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's DEI for the taxable year ($320x), divided by DC's depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's income for Year 1 ($400x). Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $3,200x ($4,000x x 0.8) of DC's average adjusted basis in the machine is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining DC's QBAI for the taxable year.
