###### ยง 1.668(b)-3A Computation of the beneficiary's income and tax for a prior taxable year.
####### Averaging.

(c)A beneficiary who uses the exact method may recompute his tax for a prior taxable year by using income averaging for all of his actual income for that year, plus the amount deemed distributed in that year under section 666, even though he may not have actually used section 1301 to determine his income tax for such taxable year. For purposes of such recomputation, the beneficiary's income for all other taxable years involved must include any amounts deemed distributed in such years from the current and all prior accumulation distributions. See ยง 1.668(b)-4A(c)(3) for additional information requirements. The beneficiary may not apply the provisions of this paragraph to a taxable year in which an amount is deemed to be income by reason of ยง 1.666(d)-1A(b). The accumulation distribution itself is not eligible for income averaging in the years in which it is paid, credited, or required to be distributed. See section 1302 (a)(2)(B) and the regulations thereunder.
