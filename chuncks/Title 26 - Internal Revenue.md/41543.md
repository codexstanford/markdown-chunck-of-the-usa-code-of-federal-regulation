###### ยง 1.963-6 Deficiency distribution.
####### In general.

(a)Section 963(e)(2) and this section provide a method under which, by virtue of a deficiency distribution, a United States shareholder may be relieved from the payment of a deficiency in tax for any taxable year arising by reason of failure to include subpart F income in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i), when it has been determined that such shareholder has failed to receive a minimum distribution for such year in respect of which it elected to secure the exclusion under section 963. In addition, this section provides rules with respect to a credit or refund of part or all of any such deficiency which has been paid. Under the method provided, the benefit of the exclusion of subpart F income from gross income of the United States shareholder is allowed retroactively for the taxable year in respect of which the election under section 963 applied, but only if the subsequent deficiency distribution meets the requirements of this section. The benefits of the retroactive exclusion will not, however, prevent the assessment of interest, additional amounts, and assessable penalties.
