####### Analysis.

(B)The right of the holder of the preferred stock to receive 6% of par value is not a restriction or other limitation within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. The amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to FC1's preferred shares is $360x (0.06 x $100x x 60) and with respect to its common shares is $640x ($1,000x-$360x). As a result, the amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution to USP1 is $570x, the sum of $90x ($360x x 15/60) with respect to its preferred shares and $480x ($640x x 30/40) with respect to its common shares. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USP1's pro rata share of the subpart F income of FC1 is $285x ($500x x $570x/$1,000x).
