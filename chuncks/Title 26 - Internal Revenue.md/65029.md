###### ยง 31.3406(g)-3 Exemption while payee is waiting for a taxpayer identification number.
####### Special rule for readily tradable instruments.

(b)The 60-day awaiting-TIN exemption described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments only if the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate directly to the payor. If a broker acquires a readily tradable instrument through a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in ยง 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)) for a payee who has no taxpayer identification number, the broker must advise the payor as required in ยง 31.3406(d)-4(a)(1) that the payee failed to provide a taxpayer identification number under penalties of perjury, regardless of whether the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate to the broker. Once a payor is notified by a broker that a payee failed to provide a taxpayer identification number in the required manner, or that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C), the payor must impose withholding under section 3406 for the appropriate period described in ยง 31.3406(e)-1.
