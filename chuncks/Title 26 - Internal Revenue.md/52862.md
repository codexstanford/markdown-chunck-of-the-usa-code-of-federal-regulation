####### Inadvertent waivers of loss carryovers previously subject to an election described in § 1.1502-20(g).

(B)If, in connection with the acquisition of S, the group made an election pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section to waive loss carryovers of S by identifying the amount of each loss carryover deemed not to expire, the prior group elected to determine the amount of the allowable loss or the basis reduction required with respect to the stock of S or a higher-tier corporation of S by applying the provisions described in § 1.1502-20(i)(2)(i) or (ii), and the amount of S's loss carryovers treated as reattributed to the prior group pursuant to the election described in § 1.1502-20(g) is reduced pursuant to § 1.1502-20(i)(3), then the group may amend its election made pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section to provide that all or a portion of the loss carryovers of S that are treated as loss carryovers of S as a result of the prior group's election to apply the provisions described in § 1.1502-20(i)(2)(i) or (ii) are deemed not to expire. This paragraph (b)(4)(vii)(B), however, does not permit a group to reduce the amount of any loss carryover deemed not to expire as a result of the election made pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
