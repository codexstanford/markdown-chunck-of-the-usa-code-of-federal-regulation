() The condition of paragraph (o)(5)(iii) of this section is satisfied because the aggregate basis of the TFD stock immediately after the section 361 exchange is not greater than the aggregate basis of the TFD stock at the time of the initial transfer (as adjusted for any gain recognized by UST on such transfer). If the basis condition of paragraph (o)(5)(iii) were not satisfied, under paragraph (o)(5)(iii) of this section, DC could reduce the basis of the TFD stock received in the reorganization. Alternatively, a new gain recognition agreement could be entered into if paragraph (k)(14) of this section applied to the disposition of the TFD stock pursuant to the section 361 exchange.
