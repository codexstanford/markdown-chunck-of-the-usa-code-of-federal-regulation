###### ยง 1.430(h)(3)-2 Plan-specific substitute mortality tables used to determine present value.
####### Application of controlled group consistency rules.

(ii)In the case of an employer that participates in a multiple-employer plan, if the proportion of the plan's funding target attributable to the employees and former employees of the employer and members of its controlled group represents more than 50 percent of the plan's funding target, then the employer is treated as maintaining the plan for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Thus, for a multiple-employer plan with credible mortality information that is treated as maintained by an employer under this paragraph (c)(7), unless substitute mortality tables are used for that plan, substitute mortality tables may not be used for any plan maintained by that employer or a member of its controlled group (and if substitute mortality tables are used for any other plan maintained by any member of the employer's controlled group, they must be used for the multiple-employer plan). By contrast, if the proportion of the plan's funding target attributable to the employees and former employees of the employer and members of its controlled group represents 50 percent or less of the funding target for a multiple-employer plan in which it participates, then the employer is not treated as maintaining the plan for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Accordingly, whether substitute mortality tables may be used for other plans in such an employer's controlled group is independent of whether substitute mortality tables are used for the multiple-employer plan.
