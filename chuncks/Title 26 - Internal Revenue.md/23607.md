####### Mortality tables used to determine current liability.

(a)The mortality assumptions that apply to a defined benefit plan for the plan year pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(A) and § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a) are used to determine a multiemployer plan's current liability for purposes of applying the rules of section 431(c)(6). Either the generational mortality tables used pursuant to § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(2) or the static mortality tables used pursuant to § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(3) may be used for a multiemployer plan for this purpose. However, for this purpose, substitute mortality tables under § 1.430(h)(3)-2 may not be used for a multiemployer plan.
