####### Notification in the event of multiple episodes of care.

(ii)A hospital facility may satisfy the notification requirements described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section simultaneously for multiple episodes of care and notify the individual about the ECA(s) the hospital facility intends to initiate to obtain payment for multiple outstanding bills for care. However, if a hospital facility aggregates an individual's outstanding bills for multiple episodes of care before initiating one or more ECAs to obtain payment for those bills, it will have not have made reasonable efforts to determine whether the individual is FAP-eligible under paragraph (c)(3) of this section unless it refrains from initiating the ECA(s) until 120 days after it provided the first post-discharge billing statement for the most recent episode of care included in the aggregation.
