####### Transition rule for net unrealized built-in loss.

(2)A loss group (or loss subgroup) that has a net unrealized built-in loss on a testing date on or after June 25, 1999 may apply § 1.1502-91A(g) (and § 1.1502-96A(a) as it relates to § 1.1502-91A(g)) for the period ending on the day before June 25, 1999 to determine under § 1.382-2T(d)(ii)(A) the earliest date that its testing period begins (treating the day before June 25, 1999 as the end of a taxable year.) Thus, for example, if a consolidated group with no net operating losses has a net unrealized built-in loss determined under § 1.1502-91(g) on a testing date after June 25, 1999, but, under § 1.1502-91A(g), does not have a net unrealized built-in loss for the period ending on the day before June 25, 1999, the group's testing period begins no earlier than June 25, 1999.
