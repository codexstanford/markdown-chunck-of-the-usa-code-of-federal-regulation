####### Control.,b,b

(3)For purposes of subparagraph (2)(i)() of this paragraph, an organization is "controlled" by a foundation or one or more disqualified persons with respect to the foundation if any of such persons may, by aggregating their votes or positions of authority, require the donee organization to make an expenditure, or prevent the donee organization from making an expenditure, regardless of the method by which the control is exercised or exercisable. "Control" of a donee organization is determined without regard to any conditions imposed upon the donee as part of the distribution or any other restrictions accompanying the distribution as to the manner in which the distribution is to be used, unless such conditions or restrictions are described in paragraph (a)(8) of ยง 1.507-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). In general, it is the donee, not the distribution, which must be "controlled" by the distributing private foundation for the provisions of subparagraph (2)(i)() of this paragraph to apply. Thus, the furnishing of support to an organization and the consequent imposition of budgetary procedures upon that organization with respect to such support shall not in itself be treated as subjecting that organization to the distributing foundation's control within the meaning of this subparagraph. Such "budgetary procedures" include expenditure responsibility requirements under section 4945(d)(4). The "controlled" organization need not be a private foundation; it may be any type of exempt or nonexempt organization including a school, hospital, operating foundation, or social welfare organization.
