####### Example 2.,Example 1

(2)(i) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (f)(1) of this section (), except A pays B $300 per month for each parking space, or $36,000 for parking for 2020 (($300 x 10) x 12 = $36,000). Of the $300 per month paid for parking for each of 10 employees, $270 is excludible under section 132(a)(5) for 2020 and none of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to this amount. A properly treats the excess amount of $30 ($300-$270) per employee per month as compensation and wages. Thus, $32,400 (($270 x 10) x 12 = $32,400) is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance under paragraphs (a) and (d)(1) of this section.

(ii) The excess amount of $30 per employee per month is not excludible under section 132(a)(5). As a result, the exceptions in section 274(e)(2) and paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section are applicable to this amount. Thus, $3,600 ($36,000-$32,400 = $3,600) is not subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance and remains deductible.
