####### Attributes.,amount, location,,timing,

(6)The attributes of an intercompany item or corresponding item are all of the item's characteristics, exceptandnecessary to determine the item's effect on taxable income (and tax liability). For example, attributes include character, source, treatment as excluded from gross income or as a noncapital, nondeductible amount, and treatment as built-in gain or loss under section 382(h) or 384. In contrast, the characteristics of property, such as a member's holding period, or the fact that property is included in inventory, are not attributes of an item, but these characteristics might affect the determination of the attributes of items from the property.
