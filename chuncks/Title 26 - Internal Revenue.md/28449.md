####### Anti-abuse rule for complete FAP applications.

(ii)A hospital facility will not have made reasonable efforts to determine whether an individual is FAP-eligible if the hospital facility bases its determination that the individual is not FAP-eligible on information that the hospital facility has reason to believe is unreliable or incorrect or on information obtained from the individual under duress or through the use of coercive practices. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii), a coercive practice includes delaying or denying emergency medical care to an individual until the individual has provided information requested to determine whether the individual is FAP-eligible for the care being delayed or denied.
