() After deduction of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 2, the net operating loss cumulative register is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. The P group deducted $48 of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 2. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of taxable income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 x 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the net operating loss cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the net operating loss cumulative register ($60-$60).
