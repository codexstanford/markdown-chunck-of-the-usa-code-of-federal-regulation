####### Effective date.,see

(e)This section applies to conversion transactions that occur on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002. In lieu of applying this section, taxpayers generally may apply § 1.337(d)-5 to determine the tax consequences (for all taxable years) of any conversion transaction that occurs on or after June 10, 1987 and before January 2, 2002, except that RICs and REITs that are subject to section 1374 treatment with respect to a conversion transaction may not rely on § 1.337(d)-5(b)(1), but must apply paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(3) of this section, with respect to built-in gains and losses recognized in taxable years beginning on or after January 2, 2002. Taxpayers are not prevented from relying on § 1.337(d)-5 merely because they elect section 1374 treatment in the manner described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section instead of in the manner described in § 1.337(d)-5(b)(3) and (c). For conversion transactions that occur on or after January 2, 2002,§ 1.337(d)-7.
