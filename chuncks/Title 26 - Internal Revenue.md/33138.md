####### Reduction of taking co-producer's payment deduction for depletion claimed on another co-producer's gas.

(B)If a taking co-producer claims an allowance for depletion on another co-producer's gas, the taking co-producer must reduce its deduction claimed in a later year for making a payment to the other co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas by the amount of any percentage depletion deduction allowed on the gas sales to which the payment relates. If the percentage limitation of section 613A(d)(1) applied to disallow a depletion deduction for a previous year, the taking co-producer must reduce the amount of any carried over depletion deduction allowable in the year of the payment or in a future year by the portion of the carried over depletion deduction, if any, that relates to another co-producer's gas.
