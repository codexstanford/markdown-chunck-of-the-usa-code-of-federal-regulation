####### Late-joining trustee-documented trusts.

(ii)In general, with respect to a certification period, the responsible officer of a trustee is not required to make a certification for a trustee-documented trust for which the trustee first agreed to act as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA during the six-month period before the end of the trustee's certification period, provided that the responsible officer of the trustee makes certifications for such trustee-documented trust for subsequent certification periods and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the trustee during which the trustee acted as the trustee of the trustee-documented trust. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to a trustee-documented trust that, immediately before the trustee first agrees to act as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA, was a trustee-documented trust of another trustee. The trustee of a trustee-documented trust may certify for a trustee-documented trust described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the trustee before the date that the trustee first agrees to act as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA if the trustee obtains from the trustee-documented trust (or the trust's former trustee, if applicable) a written certification that the trust has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: The trustee does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the trustee-documented trust for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period during which the trustee acts as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA.
