####### Periods to which the tables for a daily or miscellaneous payroll period are applicable,In general.

(c)-(1)The tables applicable to a daily or miscellaneous payroll period show the tentative amount of tax to be deducted and withheld from an employee's wages for the employee's filing status for one day. Where the withholding is computed under the rules applicable to a miscellaneous payroll period, the wages and the amounts shown in the applicable table must be placed on a comparable basis. This may be accomplished by reducing the wages paid for the period to a daily basis by dividing the total wages by the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the period. The amount of the tax shown in the applicable table as the tax required to be withheld from the wages, as so reduced to a daily basis, should then be multiplied by the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the period.
