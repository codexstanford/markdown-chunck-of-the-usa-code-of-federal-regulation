###### ยง 1.1474-3 Withheld tax as credit to beneficial owner of income.
####### Amounts paid to persons that are not the beneficial owners.

(b)Amounts actually deducted and withheld under chapter 4 on payments made to a fiduciary, agent, partnership, trust, or intermediary are deemed to have been paid by the beneficial owner of the item of income or other payment subject to withholding under chapter 4, except when the fiduciary, agent, partnership, trust, or intermediary pays the tax from its own funds and does not in turn withhold with respect to the payment made to such person. Thus, for example, if a beneficiary of a trust is subject to the taxes imposed by section 1, 2, 3, or 11 upon any amount of distributable net income or other taxable distribution received from a foreign trust, the part of any amount withheld at source under chapter 4 that is properly allocable to the income so taxed to such beneficiary shall be credited against the amount of the income tax computed upon the beneficiary's return, and any excess shall be refunded to the beneficiary in accordance with ยง 1.1474-5 and chapter 65 of the Code.
