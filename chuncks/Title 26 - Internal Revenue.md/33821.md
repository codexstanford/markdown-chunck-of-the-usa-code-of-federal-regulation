(a)(1) In the case of a regulated investment company which furnishes capital to development corporations, section 851 (e) provides an exception to the rule relating to the diversification of investments, made applicable to regulated investment companies by section 851(b)(4)(A). This exception (as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) is available only to registered management investment companies which the Securities and Exchange Commission determines, in accordance with regulations issued by it, and certifies to the Secretary or his delegate, not earlier than 60 days before the close of the taxable year of such investment company, to be principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available.

(2) For the purpose of the aforementioned determination and certification, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines otherwise, a corporation shall be considered to be principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, for at least 10 years after the date of the first acquisition of any security in such corporation or any predecessor thereof by such investment company if at the date of such acquisition the corporation or its predecessor was principally so engaged, and an investment company shall be considered at any date to be furnishing capital to any company whose securities it holds if within 10 years before such date it had acquired any of such securities, or any securities surrendered in exchange therefor, from such other company or its predecessor.
