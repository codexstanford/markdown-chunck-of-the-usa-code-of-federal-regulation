####### Principal purpose.

(C)Whether a transaction or a series of integrated or related transactions is entered into with a principal purpose described in paragraph (b)(22)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section depends on all the facts and circumstances related to the transaction(s), except for those facts described in paragraph (b)(22)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section. A purpose may be a principal purpose even though it is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately). Factors to be taken into account in determining whether one of the taxpayer's principal purposes for entering into the transaction(s) include the taxpayer's normal borrowing rate in the taxpayer's functional currency, whether the taxpayer would enter into the transaction(s) in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business, whether the parties to the transaction(s) are related persons (within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)), whether there is a significant and bona fide business purpose for the structure of the transaction(s), whether the transactions are transitory, for example, due to a circular flow of cash or other property, and the substance of the transaction(s).
