####### Analysis.

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), D is required to include $25x in gross income in 2021 as D has a fixed right to receive $25x as of the end of 2021. Although D reports $60x of AFS revenue from the provision of services for 2021, D has an enforceable right to recover only $25x if the customer were to terminate the contract on the last day of 2021. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, of the $60x of AFS revenue reported for 2021, only $25x is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" under the AFS income inclusion rule. As a result, D is required to include only $25x in gross income in 2021. Similarly, in 2022, 2023 and 2024, D includes in gross income only the yearly $25x contract payments under the all events test as only the billed amounts are treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" under the AFS income inclusion rule.
