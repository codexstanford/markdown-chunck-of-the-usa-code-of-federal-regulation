####### Special rule for additional premiums resulting from an increase in risk exposure.

(ii)An insurance company reports additional premiums that result from an increase in risk exposure during the effective period of an insurance contract in gross premiums written for the taxable year in which the change in risk exposure occurs. Unless the increase in risk exposure is of temporary duration (for example, an increase in risk exposure under a workers' compensation policy due to seasonal variations in the policyholder's payroll), the company reports additional premiums resulting from an increase in risk exposure based on the remainder of the effective period of the insurance contract.
