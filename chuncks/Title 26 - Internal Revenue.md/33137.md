####### Special rules for production credits and depletion deductions under the cumulative method,In general.

(iii)-(A)Under the cumulative method, a co-producer's depletion allowance and production credit for a taxable year are based on its income from gas sales and production of gas from its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir, and are not based on its current proportionate share of income and production as determined under the JOA. Thus, in general, a taking co-producer is not allowed a production credit or an allowance for depletion on its sales of gas in excess of its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir. However, the Service will not disallow depletion deductions or production credits claimed by a taking co-producer on the gas of other co-producers if the taking co-producer had a reasonable but mistaken belief that the deductions or credits were claimed with respect to the taking co-producer's percentage share of total gas in the reservoir and the taking co-producer makes the appropriate reductions and additions to tax required in paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. The reasonableness of the mistaken belief is determined at the time of filing the return claiming the deductions or credits. A co-producer receiving a payment for sales of its gas from a taking co-producer claims a production credit and an allowance for depletion relating to those sales only for the taxable year in which the amount of the payment is included in its gross income.
