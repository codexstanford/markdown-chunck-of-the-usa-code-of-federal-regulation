####### Ultimate purchaser.

(j)The term "ultimate purchaser" includes only a person who is an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm. A person who is an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm is an ultimate purchaser of gasoline only with respect to such gasoline as is purchased by the person and used for farming purposes on a farm of which the person is the owner, tenant, or operator. Thus the owner of a farm who purchases gasoline which is used on the farm by its owner, tenant, or operator for farming purposes is generally the ultimate purchaser of the gasoline. If, however, the cost of gasoline supplied by an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm, is by agreement or other arrangement borne by a second person who is an owner, or operator of the farm, the second person who bore the cost of the gasoline is considered to be the ultimate purchaser of the gasoline.
