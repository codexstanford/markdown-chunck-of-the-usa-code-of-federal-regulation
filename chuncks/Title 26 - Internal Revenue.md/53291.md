####### Example 4.

(iv)The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, except that P elects under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the carryback of $150 arising in 2022. The setoff in Example 2 is not restored. However, the offsettable nonlife consolidated net operating loss for 2022 (or that may be carried over from 2022) is zero. See paragraph (h)(3)(viii) of this section. Nevertheless, the $150 nonlife consolidated net operating loss may be carried over to be used by the nonlife group.
