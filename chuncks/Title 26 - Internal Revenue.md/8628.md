####### Analysis.

(ii)Because Note A is qualified nonrecourse indebtedness that is secured by Building B, in allocating interest expense between Businesses X and Y, T first must directly allocate the $100x of interest expense it paid with respect to Note A to Business X in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Thereafter, T must allocate the remaining $400x of interest expense between Businesses X and Y under paragraph (c) of this section. After excluding $1,000x of T's basis in Building B to reflect the amount of Note A (see paragraph (d)(4) of this section), and without regard to T's $200x of cash and cash equivalents (see paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section), T's basis in its assets used in Businesses X and Y is $2,600x and $800x (76.5 percent and 23.5 percent), respectively. Thus, $306x of the remaining $400x of interest expense would be allocated to Business X, and $94x would be allocated to Business Y.
