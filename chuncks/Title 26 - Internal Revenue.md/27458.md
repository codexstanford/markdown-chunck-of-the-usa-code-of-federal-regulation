###### ยง 1.482-4 Methods to determine taxable income in connection with a transfer of intangible property.
####### Comparability,In general.,1

(iii)-(A)The degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions is determined by applying the comparability provisions of ยง 1.482-1(d). Although all of the factors described in ยง 1.482-1(d)(3) must be considered, specific factors may be particularly relevant to this method. In particular, the application of this method requires that the controlled and uncontrolled transactions involve either the same intangible property or comparable intangible property, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)() of this section. In addition, because differences in contractual terms, or the economic conditions in which transactions take place, could materially affect the amount charged, comparability under this method also depends on similarity with respect to these factors, or adjustments to account for material differences in such circumstances.
