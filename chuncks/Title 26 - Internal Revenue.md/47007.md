####### Passive treatment of stock and partnership interests.

(4)For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), shares of stock in a corporation that is not a look-through subsidiary (as defined in ยง 1.1297-2(g)(3)) and partnership interests in a partnership that is not a look-through partnership (as defined in ยง 1.1297-2(g)(4)) with respect to a tested foreign corporation for a taxable year or portion thereof are treated as passive assets for the taxable year or relevant portion thereof, except to the extent the stock or partnership interest is treated as a dual-character asset under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (d)(3) of this section because it produces both passive and non-passive income, or the stock or partnership interest produces solely non-passive income for the taxable year under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section or under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
