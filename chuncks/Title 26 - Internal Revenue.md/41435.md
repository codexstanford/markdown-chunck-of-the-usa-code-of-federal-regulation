####### Example 2.,Example 1

(2)The facts for Year 1 and Year 2 are the same as in paragraph (f)(1) of this section (the facts in), except that in Year 0, in which USP also claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901, USP pays $11x of foreign income taxes in excess of the general category limitation and such excess is not absorbed as a carryback to the prior year under section 904(c). Therefore, there is no increase under section 960(c)(1) in the limitation for Year 2 since the amount ($21x) by which the Year 1 limitation was increased by reason of the inclusion in USP's gross income for Year 1 under section 951(a), less the foreign income taxes ($21x) allowed as a credit which were allowable solely by reason of such inclusion, is zero. The foreign income taxes so allowed as a credit for Year 1 which were allowable solely by reason of such section 951(a) inclusion consist of the $10 of foreign income taxes deemed paid for Year 1 under section 960(a) and the $11x of foreign income taxes for Year 0 carried over and deemed paid for Year 1 under section 904(c).
