####### Residence of an estate.

(c)An estate of an individual is treated as a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, prior to his death. However, the estate of an individual who was not a resident of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and who was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date of his death, is not treated as a resident of any State. For purposes of determining the decedent's last State of residence, the rules of paragraph (b) shall be applied irrespective of whether subchapter E was in effect at the time the period of 135 consecutive days of residence began, or whether the decedent's last State of residence is a State electing to enter into an agreement pursuant to subchapter E. The determination of the State of residence of an estate pursuant to this paragraph shall not be governed by any determination under State law as to which State is treated as the residence or domicile of the decedent for purposes other than its individual income tax (such as liability for State inheritance tax or jurisdiction of probate proceedings).
