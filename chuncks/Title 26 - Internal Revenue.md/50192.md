##### Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations and Tax-Free Covenant Bonds
###### § 1.1446-1 Withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected taxable income.
####### Foreign governments, foreign tax-exempt organizations and other foreign persons.

(G)A Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8EXP) submitted by a partner that is a foreign government, foreign tax-exempt organization, or other foreign person for purposes of withholding under §§ 1441 through 1443 will also operate to establish the foreign status of such partner under this section. However, except as set forth in § 1.1446-2(b)(4)(iii) (regarding withholding qualified holders (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) and § 1.1446-3(c)(3) (regarding certain tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)), the submission of Form W-8EXP (or successor) will have no effect on whether there is a 1446 tax due with respect to such partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI. For example, a partnership must still pay 1446 tax with respect to a foreign government partner's allocable share of ECTI because such partner is treated as a foreign corporation under section 892(a)(3). If no Form W-8 is submitted for purposes of withholding under sections 1441 through 1443, then such government, tax-exempt organization, or person must generally submit Form W-8BEN.
