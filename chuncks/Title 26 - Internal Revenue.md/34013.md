(ii)The trustees or directors of the real estate investment trust are not required to delegate or contract out their fiduciary duty to manage the trust itself, as distinguished from rendering or furnishing services to the tenants of its property or managing or operating the property. Thus, the trustees or directors may do all those things necessary, in their fiduciary capacities, to manage and conduct the affairs of the trust itself. For example, the trustees or directors may establish rental terms, choose tenants, enter into and renew leases, and deal with taxes, interest, and insurance, relating to the trust's property. The trustees or directors may also make capital expenditures with respect to the trust's property (as defined in section 263) and may make decisions as to repairs of the trust's property (of the type which would be deductible under section 162), the cost of which may be borne by the trust.
