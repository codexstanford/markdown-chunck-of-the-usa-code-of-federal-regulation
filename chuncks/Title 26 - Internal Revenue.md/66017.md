###### Voyage.

(b)For purposes of this section, "voyage" means a journey of a vessel that includes the outward and homeward trips or passages. The voyage commences when the vessel begins to load passengers and continues during the entire ensuing period until the vessel has made one outward and one homeward passage (including intermediate passages, if made). A voyage may be a covered voyage with respect to a passenger even if the passenger does not make both an outward and homeward passage or if the point of first embarkation or disembarkation by the passenger in the United States is an intermediate stop of the vessel.
