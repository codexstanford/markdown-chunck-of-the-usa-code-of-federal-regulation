###### § 1.960-1 Overview, definitions, and computational rules for determining foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 960(a), (b), and (d).
####### Allocation and apportionment of a current year tax,In general.

(ii)-(A)A current year tax is allocated and apportioned among the section 904 categories under the rules of § 1.904-6. An amount of the current year tax that is allocated and apportioned to a section 904 category is then allocated and apportioned among the income groups within the section 904 category under § 1.861-20 (as modified by § 1.904-6(c)) by treating each income group as a statutory grouping and treating the residual income group as the residual grouping. Therefore, foreign gross income attributable to a base difference is assigned to the residual income grouping under § 1.861-20(d)(2)(ii)(B). See, however, paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section for special rules for applying § 1.861-20 in the case of PTEP groups. For purposes of determining foreign income taxes deemed paid under the rules in §§ 1.960-2 and 1.960-3, the U.S. dollar amount of eligible current year taxes is assigned to the section 904 categories, income groups, and PTEP groups (to the extent provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) to which the eligible current year taxes are allocated and apportioned.
