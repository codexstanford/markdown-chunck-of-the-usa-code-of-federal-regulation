A-14: (a)-(1)For purposes of determining the group of highly compensated employees for a determination year, the determination year calculation is made on the basis of the applicable year of the plan or other entity for which a determination is being made and the look-back year calculation is made on the basis of the twelve month period immediately preceding such year. Thus, in testing plans X and Y of an employer, if plan X has a calendar year plan year and plan Y has a July 1 to June 30 plan year, the determination year calculation and look-back year calculation for plan X must be made on the basis of the calendar year. Similarly, the determination year calculation and look-back year calculation for plan Y must be made on the basis of the July 1 to June 30 year.
