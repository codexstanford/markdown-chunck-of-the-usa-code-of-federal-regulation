None of the depreciation with respect to Asset F is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale. The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset F is $220x. PRS has $20x of gross income, a $22x depreciation deduction with respect to Asset F, and no other income or expense in Year 1. FC's distributive share of the gross income is $10x, all of which is includible in FC's gross tested income in Year 1, and FC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset F is $11x in Year 1, all of which is allocated and apportioned to FC's gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3). FC's distributive share of loss from PRS is $1x. FC also has $8x of gross tested income from other sources in Year 1 and no other deductions. Therefore, FC has tested income of $7x for Year 1.
