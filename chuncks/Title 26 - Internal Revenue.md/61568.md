##### ยง 11.401(a)-11 Qualified joint and survivor annuities.
###### In general,General rule.,i.e.,

(a)-(1)A trust, which is a part of a plan providing for the payment of benefits in any form of a life annuity (an annuity requiring survival of the participant or his spouse as a condition for payment), shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a)(11) and this section unless such plan provides that these benefits must be paid in a form having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity. Therefore, any benefits which may be paid in any form of a life annuity must be paid in a form having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity unless the participant makes the election, described in paragraph (c) of this section, not to receive benefits in this form. A plan will not fail to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) and this section merely because it provides that the spouse of a deceased participant may elect to have benefits paid in a form other than a qualified joint and survivor annuity. Section 401(a)(11) and this section shall apply only in the case of a plan to which section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards) applies without regard to section 411(e)(2). Without regard to the election provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, unless an election has been made under paragraph (c) of this section, a plan to which this section applies must provide that a survivor annuity shall be payable on the death of an active participant after normal retirement age.
