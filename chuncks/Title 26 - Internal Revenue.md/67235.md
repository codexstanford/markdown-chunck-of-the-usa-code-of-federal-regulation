(ii) That, in the case of a highway vehicles owned by the United States, is used on the highway.

(2) Any highway vehicle operated under a dealer's tag, license, or permit will be considered to be registered.

(4) Examples of gasoline used in a qualified business use include:

(i) Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) in stationary engines to operate pumps, generators, compressors, and power saws;

(ii) Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) for cleaning purposes;

(iii) Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) in forklift trucks, bulldozers, and earthmovers; and
