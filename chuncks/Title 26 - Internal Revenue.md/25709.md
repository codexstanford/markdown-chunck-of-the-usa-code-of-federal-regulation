###### § 1.467-1 Treatment of lessors and lessees generally.
####### Cases in which rules are inapplicable.

(2)Section 467 applies only to leases (or other similar arrangements) that constitute section 467 rental agreements as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. For example, a rental agreement is not a section 467 rental agreement, and, therefore, is not subject to the provisions of this section and §§ 1.467-2 through 1.467-9 (the section 467 regulations), if it specifies equal amounts of rent for each month throughout the lease term and all payments of rent are due in the calendar year to which the rent relates (or in the preceding or succeeding calendar year). In addition, the section 467 regulations do not apply to a rental agreement that requires total rents of $250,000 or less. For purposes of determining whether the agreement has total rents of $250,000 or less, certain specified contingent rent is disregarded.
