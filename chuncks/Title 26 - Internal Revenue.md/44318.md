####### Cost of replacement project.

(3)The taxpayer's cost for the replacement project includes only amounts properly treated as capital expenditures by the taxpayer that are attributable to acquisition, construction, or reconstruction made within the reinvestment period (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section). See section 263 for rules as to what constitutes capital expenditures. Thus, assume that a calendar year taxpayer realizes gain in 1970 upon the approved disposition of a qualified housing project occurring on January 1, 1970. If the taxpayer had begun construction of another qualified housing project on January 1, 1969, and completes such construction on June 1, 1972, only that portion of the cost attributable to the period before January 1, 1972, constitutes the cost of the replacement project for purposes of section 1039. For purposes of determining the cost of a replacement project attributable to a particular period, the total cost of the project may be allocated to such period on the basis of the portion of the total project actually constructed during such period.
