###### ยง 1.665(b)-2A Special rules for accumulation distributions made in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1974.
####### Certain distributions at specified ages.

(3)Paragraph (3) of section 665(b) as in effect on December 31, 1968, provided an exclusion (in the case of certain trusts created before January 1, 1954) from the definition of an accumulation distribution for amounts properly paid or credited to a beneficiary upon his attaining a specified age or ages, subject to certain restrictions (see ยง 1.665(b)-2(b)(3)). Therefore, a distribution from a trust in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1968, will not be subject to the tax imposed under section 668(a)(2) to the extent such distribution would be allocated to a preceding taxable year of the trust beginning before January 1, 1969, if such distribution would have qualified under the provisions of ยง 1.665(b)-2(b)(3) had it been made in a taxable year of the trust to which such section was applicable.
