####### Result.

(ii)Under ยง 1.1503(d)-3(c)(3), DRC's $200x loss shall be treated as having been made available to offset the $200x of income attributable to P's Country X separate unit. P's Country X separate unit is not, under U.S. tax principles, a foreign corporation, and there is no interest in DE1(which is a hybrid entity) that is not a separate unit. As a result, DRC's loss being made available to offset the income attributable to P's Country X separate unit is not considered a foreign use of such loss. Therefore, P can make a domestic use election with respect to DRC's year 1 dual consolidated loss.
