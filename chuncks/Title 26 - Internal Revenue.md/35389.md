###### ยง 1.863-1 Allocation of gross income under section 863(a).
####### Example 1. No additional production, foreign source gross receipts.

(i)U.S. Mines, a domestic corporation, operates a copper mine and mill in Country X. U.S. Mines extracts copper-bearing rocks from the ground and transports the rocks to the mill where the rocks are ground and processed to produce copper-bearing concentrate. The concentrate is transported to a port where it is dried in preparation for export, stored, and then shipped to purchasers in the United States. Because, under the facts and circumstances, none of U.S. Mines' activities constitute additional production activities, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply, and under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, gross receipts from the sale of the concentrate will be treated as from sources without the United States.
