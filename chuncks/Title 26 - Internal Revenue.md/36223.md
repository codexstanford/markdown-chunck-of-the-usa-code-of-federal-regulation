(c)Though subject to the tax imposed by section 1, an individual to whom this section applies will nevertheless be treated as a nonresident alien individual for the purpose of many provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) relating to nonresident alien individuals. Thus, for example, such an individual is not allowed the standard deduction (section 63(c)(6)); is subject to withholding of tax at source under chapter 3 of the Code (for example, section 1441(e)); is generally excepted from the collection of income tax at source on wages for services performed in the possession (section 3401(a)(6)); is not allowed to make a joint return (section 6013(a)(1)); and, if described in section 6072(c), must pay his first installment of estimated income tax on or before the 15th day of the 6th month of the taxable year (section 6654(j) and (k)) and must pay his income tax on or before the 15th day of the 6th month following the close of the taxable year (sections 6072(c) and 6151(a)). In addition, under section 152(b)(3), an individual is not allowed a deduction for a dependent who is a resident of the relevant possession unless the dependent is a citizen or national of the United States.
