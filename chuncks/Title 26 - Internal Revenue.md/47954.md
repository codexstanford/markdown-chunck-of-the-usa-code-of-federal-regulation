###### § 1.1371-2 Impact of Audit PTTP on ETSC Period.
####### Intervening audit PTTP.

(B)Pursuant to section 1377(b)(1)(B), X enters an intervening audit PTTP that begins on July 6, 2020, and ends on November 2, 2020. The application of section 1371(f) and § 1.1371-1 to distributions during the intervening audit PTTP is stopped. Instead, sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(B) and §§ 1.1371-2 and 1.1377-2 apply for the duration of the intervening audit PTTP. During the intervening audit PTTP, the only distribution X made is a $6,000 distribution of money to A on September 1, 2020. Pursuant to sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(B), the $6,000 distribution is characterized as a distribution of AAA because it was made during the intervening audit PTTP.
