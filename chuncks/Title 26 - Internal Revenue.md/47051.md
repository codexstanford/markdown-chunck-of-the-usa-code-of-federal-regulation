####### Results.,Example 2

(B)The results are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section (the results in), except that TFC's assets also do not include the stock of LTS2. Similarly, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as owning $80x (40% x $200x) of the LTS1 loan to LTS2, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of an indirect LTS obligation and accordingly, TFC does not take into account $24x (30% x $80x) of the loan to LTS2. As a result, TFC's assets include only $56x ($80x - $24x) of the LTS1 loan to LTS2. Furthermore, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as receiving $2x (40% x $5x) of the interest received by LTS1 from LTS2, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of interest with respect to an indirect LTS obligation and thus, TFC does not take into account $0.60x (30% x $2x) of the interest received by LTS1. Accordingly, TFC's income includes only $1.40x ($2x - $0.60x) of the interest from LTS2. Furthermore, TFC's assets include $2x (40% x $5x) of LTS1's cash received from LTS2.
