####### Activity in the United States,In general.

(3)-(i)A loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States if the loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States. Conversely, a loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States if the loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States. In addition, a loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States if the loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States. If the premium which is attributable to the reinsuring or issuing of any insurance contract in connection with an activity ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States can, on a reasonable basis, be allocated to, or apportioned between, the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on in, and the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on outside, the United States, such loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States to the extent the loss or liability would result, if at all, from that activity carried on outside the United States. However, a loss or liability will not be considered a loss or liability which could arise from an activity performed in the United States if such loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity which is neither exclusively carried on in the United States nor ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States. The principles of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for allocating or apportioning a premium on a reasonable basis to or between risks incurred when property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when such property is actually located outside the United States shall apply for allocating or apportioning a premium on a reasonable basis to or between the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on in, and the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on outside, the United States. The rules prescribed in subdivisions (ii) through (vi) of this subparagraph shall apply in determining whether an activity is, or will be considered, exclusively carried on in or outside the United States and whether an activity is, or will be considered, ordinarily carried on in the United States and in determining what is the activity which is performed by the insured from which a loss or liability results or could result; such rules also limit the rule of premium allocation and apportionment prescribed in this subdivision. The determinations required by this subparagraph shall be made with respect to the location of an activity of the insured performed during the policy period applicable to the taxable year of the insuring or reinsuring corporation, or, if more than one policy period exists with respect to such taxable year, such determinations shall be made separately with respect to the location of the activity during each such policy period.
