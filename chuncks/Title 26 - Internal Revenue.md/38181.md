####### Trade or business outside the United States.

(B)Activities carried out in the United States, whether or not such activities are described in ยง 1.989(a)-1(b)(3), do not constitute the conduct of a trade or business outside the United States. Activities carried out outside the United States that constitute a permanent establishment under the terms of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the activities are carried out constitute a trade or business conducted outside the United States for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(B). In determining whether activities constitute a trade or business under ยง 1.989(a)-1(c), disregarded payments are taken into account and may give rise to a trade or business, provided that the activities (together with any other activities of the QBU) would otherwise satisfy the rule in ยง 1.989(a)-1(c).
