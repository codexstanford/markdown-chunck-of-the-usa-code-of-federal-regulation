####### Taxable year beginning in 2022.,Example 1

(C)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) of this section, except that the taxable year begins in 2022 and therefore depreciation deductions are not added back to ATI under ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(1)(i)(E). As a result, T's ATI for 2022 is $470x ($320x of tentative taxable income + $200x business interest expense-$50x business interest income = $470x), and its section 163(j) limitation for the 2022 taxable year is $191x ($50x of business interest income + 30 percent of its ATI (30 percent x $470x) = $191x). As a result, T may only deduct $191x of its business interest expense for the taxable year, and the remaining $9x is carried forward to the 2023 taxable year as a disallowed business interest expense carryforward. See ยง 1.163(j)-2(c).
