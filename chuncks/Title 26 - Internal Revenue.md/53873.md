###### ยง 1.1502-95 Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup).
####### Application in the case of a loss subgroup.

(3)If two or more former members are included in the same loss subgroup immediately after they cease to be members of a consolidated group, the principles of paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of this section apply to the loss subgroup. Therefore, for example, an apportionment by the common parent under paragraph (c) of this section is made to the loss subgroup rather than separately to its members. If the common parent of the consolidated group apportions all or part of a limitation (or net unrealized built-in gain) separately to one or more former members that are included in a loss subgroup because the common parent of the acquiring group makes an election under ยง 1.1502-91(d)(4) with respect to those members, the aggregate of those separate amounts is treated as the amount apportioned to the loss subgroup. Such separate apportionment may occur, for example, because the election under ยง 1.1502-91(d)(4) has not been filed at the time that the election of apportionment is made under paragraph (f) of this section.
