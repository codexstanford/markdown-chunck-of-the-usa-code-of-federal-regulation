###### ยง 31.3402(o)-2 Extension of withholding to annuity payments if requested by payee.
####### Definitions.

(g)For purposes of this section-

(1) The term "annuity" means periodic payments which are payable over a period greater than 1 year and which are treated under section 72 as amounts received as an annuity, whether or not such periodic payments are variable in amount. Also, periodic payments to an individual who is retired before the normal retirement age for reasons of disability, to which the provisions of section 105(d) apply, shall be deemed to be an annuity for purposes of this section. A lump-sum payment (including a total distribution under section 72(n)) is not an annuity.

(2) The term "payee" means an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States and who receives an annuity payment.

(3) The term "payor" means a person making an annuity payment except that, if the person making the payment is acting soley as an agent for another person, the term "payor" shall mean such other person and not the person actually making the payment. For example, if a bank makes an annuity payment only as agent for an employees' trust, the trust shall be deemed to be the "payor." Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any person who, under section 3401(a) (5) or (8), would not be required to deduct and withhold the tax under section 3402 if the annuity payment were remuneration for services shall not be considered a "payor."
