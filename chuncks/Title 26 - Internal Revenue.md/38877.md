()The determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is included in a CFC group is made as of the close of the first redetermination year of any controlled foreign corporation for which an election is made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. One or more controlled foreign corporations are members of a CFC group if the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)() of this section are satisfied as of the end of the first redetermination year of at least one of the controlled foreign corporations, even if the requirements are not satisfied as of the end of the first redetermination year of all controlled foreign corporations. If the controlling domestic shareholders do not have the same taxable year, the determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is a member of a CFC group is made with respect to the first redetermination year that ends with or within the taxable year of the majority of the controlling domestic shareholders (determined based on voting power) or, if no such majority taxable year exists, the calendar year.
