####### Determination of amount of working capital maintained.

(2)For purposes of this paragraph-

(i) The working capital of a DISC is the excess of its current assets over current liabilities.

(ii) Current assets are cash and other assets (other than trade receivables) which may reasonably be expected to be converted into cash or sold or consumed during the current normal operating cycle of the DISC's trade or business.

(iii) Current liabilities are obligations (or portions of obligations) due within the current normal operating cycle of the trade or business of the DISC whose satisfaction when due is reasonably expected to require the use of current assets.

(iv) Generally accepted financial accounting treatments will be accepted, and

(v) Current assets (other than temporary investments) are taken into account before temporary investments, and trade receivables are never taken into account, in determining whether such temporary investments are maintained by the DISC as reasonably necessary to meet his current liabilities and its requirements for working capital.
