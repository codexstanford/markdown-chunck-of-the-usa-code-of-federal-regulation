####### Effect of potential and actual changes in taxes paid or accrued.

(B)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(B), the amount of current year taxes paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation for purposes of this paragraph (c)(7) does not take into account any potential reduction in foreign income taxes that may occur by reason of a future distribution to shareholders of all or part of such income. However, to the extent the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the controlled foreign corporation are reasonably certain to be returned to a shareholder by the foreign country imposing such taxes, directly or indirectly, through any means (including, but not limited to, a refund, credit, payment, discharge of an obligation, or any other method) on a subsequent distribution to such shareholder, the foreign income taxes are not treated as paid or accrued for purposes of this paragraph (c)(7). In addition, foreign income taxes that have not been paid or accrued because they are contingent on a future distribution of earnings (or other similar transaction, such as a loan to a shareholder) are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(7). If, pursuant to section 905(c) and ยง 1.905-3, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required to account for the effect of a foreign tax redetermination (as defined in ยง 1.905-3(a)), this paragraph (c)(7) is applied in the adjusted year taking into account the adjusted amount of the redetermined foreign tax.
