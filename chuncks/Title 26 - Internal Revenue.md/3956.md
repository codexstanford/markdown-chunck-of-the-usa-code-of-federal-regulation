####### Amounts to be considered as a return of premiums.

(b)For the purpose of determining the extent to which amounts received represent a reduction or return of premiums or other consideration paid, the provisions of section 72 distinguish between "amounts received as an annuity" and "amounts not received as an annuity". In general, "amounts received as an annuity" are amounts which are payable at regular intervals over a period of more than one full year from the date on which they are deemed to begin, provided the total of the amounts so payable or the period for which they are to be paid can be determined as of that date. See paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of ยง 1.72-2. Any other amounts to which the provisions of section 72 apply are considered to be "amounts not received as an annuity". See ยง 1.72-11.
