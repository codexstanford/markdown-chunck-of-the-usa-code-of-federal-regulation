##### Mineral Production Payments
###### ยง 1.636-2 Production payments retained in leasing transactions.
####### Treatment by lessor.

(b)The lessor who retains a production payment in a leasing transaction (or his successors in interest) shall treat the production payment without regard to the provisions of section 636 and ยง 1.636-1. Thus, the production payment will be treated as an economic interest in the mineral in place in the hands of the lessor (or his successors in interest) and the receipts in discharge of the production payment will constitute ordinary income subject to depletion.
