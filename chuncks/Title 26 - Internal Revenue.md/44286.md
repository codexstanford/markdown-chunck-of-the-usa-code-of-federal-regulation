###### ยง 1.1038-1 Reacquisitions of real property in satisfaction of indebtedness.
####### Character of gain resulting from a reacquisition.

(d)Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section set forth the extent to which gain shall be derived from a reacquisition to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, but the rule provided by section 1038 and this section do not affect the character of the gain so derived. The character of the gain resulting from such a reacquisition is determined on the basis of whether the gain on the original sale was returned on the installment method or, if not, on the basis of whether title to the real property was transferred to the purchaser; and, if title was transferred to the purchaser in a deferred-payment sale, whether the reconveyance of the property to the seller was voluntary. For example, if the gain on the original sale of the reacquired property was returned on the installment method, the character of the gain on reacquisition by the seller shall be determined in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (a) of ยง 1.453-9. If the original sale was not on the installment method but was a deferred-payment sale, as described in ยง 1.453-6(a), where title to the real property was transferred to the purchaser and the seller accepts a voluntary reconveyance of the property, the gain on the reacquisition shall be ordinary income; however, if the obligations satisfied are securities (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C)), any gain resulting from the reacquisition is capital gain subject to the provisions of subchapter P of chapter 1 of the Code.
