(B)-()If regarded, the $500x payment from FDE to P would result in FDE holding Asset A with a basis of $500x under section 1012. Accordingly, the tentative disregarded basis (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of this section) with respect to Asset A is $500x. Because there are no adjustments described in section 1016 with respect to Asset A (including any adjustments resulting from any disregarded payments made with respect to the transferred property), the adjusted disregarded basis (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section) with respect to Asset A is $500x.
