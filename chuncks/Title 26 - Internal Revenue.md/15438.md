###### ยง 1.274-13 Disallowance of deductions for certain qualified transportation fringe expenditures.
####### Example 1.

(1)Taxpayer A pays B, a third party who owns a parking garage adjacent to A's place of business, $100 per month per parking space for each of A's 10 employees to park in B's garage, or $12,000 for parking in 2020 (($100 x 10) x 12 = $12,000). The $100 per month paid for each of A's 10 employees for parking is excludible from the employees' gross income under section 132(a)(5), and none of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable. Thus, the entire $12,000 is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance under paragraphs (a) and (d)(1) of this section.
