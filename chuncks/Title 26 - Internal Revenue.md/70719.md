###### Clarification of meaning of adverse benefit determination.

(A)For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), an "adverse benefit determination" includes an adverse benefit determination as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, in complying with 29 CFR 2560.503-1, as well as the other provisions of this paragraph (b)(2), a plan or issuer must treat a rescission of coverage (whether or not the rescission has an adverse effect on any particular benefit at that time) as an adverse benefit determination. (Rescissions of coverage are subject to the requirements of ยง 54.9815-2712.)
