###### ยง 1.955-2 Amount of a controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries.
####### Excluded charges.

(2)For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a specific charge created with respect to any item of property principally for the purpose of artificially increasing or decreasing the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries will not be recognized; whether a specific charge is created principally for such purpose will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case. One of the factors that will be considered in making such a determination with respect to a loan is whether the loan is from a related person, as defined in section 954(d)(3) and paragraph (e) of ยง 1.954-1.
