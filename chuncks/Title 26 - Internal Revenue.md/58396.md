(3)Notwithstanding any termination assessment a taxpayer shall file a return in accordance with section 6012 and the regulations thereunder for the taxpayer's full taxable year.

The return shall show all items of gross income, deductions, and credits for such taxable year. Any tax collected as a result of a termination assessment will be applied against the tax due for the taxpayer's full taxable year.
