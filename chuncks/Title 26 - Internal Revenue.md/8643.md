####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of this section, a shareholder must look through to the assets of a domestic non-consolidated C corporation for purposes of allocating the shareholder's basis in its stock in the corporation between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses if the shareholder's direct and indirect interest in the corporation satisfies the ownership requirements of section 1504(a)(2). For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of this section, a shareholder's stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a). P directly owns 80 percent of each of S and T as measured by total voting power and value; thus, P must look through to the assets of S and T when allocating the basis in its stock of S and T. P directly owns 5 percent of the stock of U as measured by total voting power and value, and P constructively owns the other 95 percent; thus, P also must look through to U's assets when allocating the basis in its U stock. S directly owns 15 percent of the stock of U, and S constructively owns only 5 percent through P; thus, S cannot look through to U's assets when allocating the basis in its U stock. T directly owns 80 percent of the stock of U, and T constructively owns an additional 5 percent; thus, T must look through to U's assets when allocating the basis in its U stock.
