###### ยง 1.642(i)-1 Certain distributions by cemetery perpetual care funds.
####### Distribution actually used for care and maintenance.

(2)The amount of a deduction otherwise allowable for care fund distributions in any taxable year shall not exceed the portion of such distributions expended by the distributee cemetery corporation for the care and maintenance of gravesites before the end of the fund's taxable year following the taxable year in which it makes the distributions. A 6-month extension of time for filing the trust's return may be obtained upon request under section 6081. The failure of a cemetery to expend the care fund's distributions within a reasonable time before the due date for filing the return will be considered reasonable grounds for granting a 6-month extension of time for section 6081. For purposes of this paragraph, any amount expended by the care fund directly for the care and maintenance of gravesites shall be treated as an additional care fund distribution which is expended on the day of distribution by the cemetery corporation. The fund shall be allowed a deduction for such direct expenditure in the fund's taxable year during which the expenditure is made.
