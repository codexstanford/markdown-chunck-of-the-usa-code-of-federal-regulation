####### No elimination of economic loss.

(8)This paragraph (c) shall not be applied in a manner that permanently disallows a deduction for an economic loss, provided that such deduction is otherwise allowable. If the application of any provision of this paragraph (c) results in such a disallowance, proper adjustment may be made to prevent such a disallowance. Whether a provision of this paragraph (c) has resulted in such a disallowance is determined on the date on which the subsidiary (or any successor) the disposition of the stock of which gave rise to a suspended stock loss is not a member of the group or the date the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of ยง 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of such subsidiary stock owned by members. Proper adjustment in such cases shall be made by restoring the suspended stock loss immediately before the subsidiary ceases to be a member of the group or the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of ยง 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of such subsidiary stock owned by members, to the extent that its reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section had the result of permanently disallowing a deduction for an economic loss.
