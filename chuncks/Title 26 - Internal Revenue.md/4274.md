###### ยง 1.84-1 Transfer of appreciated property to political organizations.
####### Transfer defined.

(a)A transfer after May 7, 1974, of property to a political organization (as defined in section 527(e)(1), and including a newsletter fund to the extent provided under section 527(g)) is treated as a sale of the property to the political organization if the fair market value of the property exceeds its adjusted basis. The transferor is treated as having realized an amount equal to the fair market value of the property on the date of the transfer. For purposes of this section, a transfer is any assignment, conveyance, or delivery of property other than a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the transfer is direct or indirect and whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible. Thus, for example, a sale at less than fair market value (other than an ordinary trade discount), or a receipt of property by a political organization under an agency agreement entitling the organization to sell the property and retain all or a portion of the proceeds of the sale, is a transfer within the meaning, of this section. The term "transfer" also includes an illegal contribution of property.
