##### ยง 400.4-1 Notice required with respect to a nonjudicial sale.
###### Inadequate notice.

(2)Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, a notice of sale described in paragraph (c) of this section which does not contain the information described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f), will not be considered adequate by a district director. If a district director determines that the notice is inadequate, he will give written notification of the items of information which are inadequate to the person who submitted the notice. In such event a notice complying with the provisions of this section (including the requirement that the notice be given 25 days prior to the sale in the case of a notice described in paragraph (c) of this section) must be given. However, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in such a case the district director may, in his discretion, consent to the sale of the property free of the lien or title of the United States even though notice of the sale is not given 25 days prior to the sale. In any case in which the person who submitted a timely notice does not receive, more than 5 days prior to the date of the sale, written notification from the district director that the notice is inadequate, the notice shall be considered adequate for the purposes of this section.
