(d)To the extent that a distribution to the United States shareholder counting toward a minimum distribution from a chain or group consists of earnings and profits distributed to a foreign corporation in the chain or group after the close of the recipient corporation's taxable year but during its distribution period for such year by another foreign corporation in such chain or group, such amount shall be treated as received by the recipient corporation on the last day of such taxable year and shall not be regarded as foreign personal holding company income (within the meaning of section 553(a) or 954(c)) of such corporation for the taxable year in which such amount is actually received. The extent to which a distribution counting toward a minimum distribution consists of earnings and profits distributed to a foreign corporation in a chain or group shall be determined under the ordering rules of paragraph (b)(3) of ยง 1.963-4 (applied in each instance as though the United States shareholder had not chosen under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of ยง 1.963-2 to take the tax described therein into account in determining the effective foreign tax rate). However, for such purpose, the amount of foreign income tax, if any, which counts toward the minimum distribution shall be determined without regard to paragraph (b)(2) of this section but in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of ยง 1.963-4.
