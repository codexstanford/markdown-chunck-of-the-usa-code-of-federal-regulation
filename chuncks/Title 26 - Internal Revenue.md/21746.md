###### ยง 1.411(d)-3 Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits.
####### Permissible elimination of benefits that are not section 411(d)(6) protected benefits,In general.

(3)-(i)Section 411(d)(6) does not provide protection for benefits that are ancillary benefits, other rights and features, or any other benefits that are not described in section 411(d)(6). See ยง 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-1(d). However, a plan may not be amended to recharacterize a retirement-type benefit as an ancillary benefit. Thus, for example, a plan amendment to recharacterize any portion of an early retirement subsidy as a social security supplement that is an ancillary benefit violates section 411(d)(6).
