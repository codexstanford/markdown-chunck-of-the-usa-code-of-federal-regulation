####### Disposition of portion of property.

(7)A disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) of a portion of an item of property gives rise to an addition to capital account described in the last sentence of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of ยง 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements). If the addition to capital account is a separate improvement within the meaning of paragraph (d) of ยง 1.1250-5, and thus an element, then immediately after the addition is made the amount of additional depreciation for such separate improvement shall be computed under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph by treating such portion and such addition as separate properties. If the addition is not a separate improvement, then immediately after the addition is made such property is considered under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of ยง 1.1250-5 as having a special element with the same amount of additional depreciation so computed. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period of the separate improvement or special element (as the case may be), which is determined under section 1250(e)(1), does not include the holding period of the property disposed of.
