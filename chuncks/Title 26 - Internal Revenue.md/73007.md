######## Credit grouping.

(ii)Any net positive adjustment or net negative adjustment in the credit grouping (including any such adjustment with respect to a subgrouping within the credit grouping) is excluded from the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment. A net positive adjustment described in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) is taken into account under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. A net negative adjustment described in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), including a negative adjustment to a credit resulting from a reallocation adjustment that was placed in a separate subgrouping pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, is treated as an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, unless the IRS determines that such net negative adjustment should be taken into account under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. A net negative adjustment to a tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership is liable under chapter 1 or an adjustment to any imputed underpayment calculated by the partnership for the taxable year is not an adjustment described in paragraph (f) of this section (adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment).
