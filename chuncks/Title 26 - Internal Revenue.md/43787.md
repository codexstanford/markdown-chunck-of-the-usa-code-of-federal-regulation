####### 2,Analysis of the fallback waterfall.,i.e.,,i.e.,,3,4

()As provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, B and L must apply the rules in paragraphs (h)(3)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) of this section to determine whether the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate. Under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, because the rate being tested as a qualified rate (the fallback waterfall) is comprised of more than one fallback rate, the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate only if each individual fallback rate (fallback rates in the first and second tiers of the fallback waterfall) separately satisfies the requirements to be a qualified rate. As concluded in paragraphs (h)(3)(iv)(C)() and () of this section, the fallback rates in the first and second tiers of the fallback waterfall separately satisfy the requirements to be a qualified rate. Therefore, the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate.
