####### Requirement for making election.

(d)(1) The election under section 613(d) shall be made by filing a statement with the district director with whom the income tax return was filed for the taxable year to which the election is applicable. Such statement shall indicate that an election is being made under section 613(d), shall contain a recomputation of the depletion allowance and the tax liability for all taxable years affected by the exercise of the election, and shall be accompanied either by a claim for refund or credit or by an amended return or returns, whichever is appropriate.

(2) If the treatment of any item upon which a tax previously determined was based, or if the application of any provisions of the internal revenue laws with respect to such tax, depends upon the amount of income (e.g., charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, dividends received credit, and medical expenses), readjustment in these particulars will be necessary as part of any recomputation in conformity with the change in the amount of the income which results solely from the making of the election under section 613(d).
