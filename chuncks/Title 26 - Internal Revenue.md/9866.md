()If a transferee in a series of related transactions acquires depreciable property from a transferor that was not in existence immediately prior to the first transfer of such property in such series (new transferor), the transferee tests its relationship with the party from which the new transferor acquired such property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)() of this section. If the series has consecutive new transferors, the party to which the last new transferor disposed of the depreciable property tests its relationship with the party from which the first new transferor acquired the depreciable property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The rules for testing the relationships in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)() of this section continue to apply for the other transactions in the series.
