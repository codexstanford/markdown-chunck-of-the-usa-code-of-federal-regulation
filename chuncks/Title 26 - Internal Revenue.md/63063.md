##### Deductions
###### ยง 25.2523(e)-1 Marital deduction; life estate with power of appointment in donee spouse.

(h)Paragraph (a)(5) of this section provides that a transfer described in paragraph (a) is nondeductible to the extent that the donor created a power in the trustee or in any other person to appoint a part of the interest to any person other than the donee spouse.
