####### Additional rules for determining priority.

(iv)If a taxpayer restates AFS revenue for a taxable year prior to the date that the taxpayer files its Federal income tax return for such taxable year, the restated AFS must be used instead of the original AFS. If using the restated AFS revenue results in a change in method of accounting, the preceding sentence applies only if the taxpayer receives permission to change its method of accounting to use the restated AFS revenue. In addition, if a taxpayer with different financial accounting and taxable years is required to file both annual financial statements and periodic financial statements covering less than a year with a government or government agency, the taxpayer must prioritize the annual financial statement in accordance with this paragraph (a)(5).
