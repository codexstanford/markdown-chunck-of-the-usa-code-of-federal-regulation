####### Limitations on certain securities.

(2)Under section 856(c)(5)(B), not more than 25 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust may be represented by securities other than those described in section 856(c)(5)(A). The ownership of securities under the 25-percent limitation in section 856(c)(5)(B) is further limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust and to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer. Thus, if the real estate investment trust meets the 75-percent asset diversification requirement in section 856(c)(5)(A), it will also meet the first test under section 856(c)(5)(B) since it will, of necessity, have not more than 25 percent of its total assets represented by securities other than those described in section 856(c)(5)(A). However, the trust must also meet two additional tests under section 856(c)(5)(B), i.e. it cannot own the securities of any one issuer in an amount (i) greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the trust's total assets, or (ii) representing more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer.
