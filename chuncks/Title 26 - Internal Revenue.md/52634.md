(F)() Individual A owns P. On January 1, 2017, A forms T. P and T are calendar-year taxpayers. In 2017, T sustains a $100 net operating loss that is carried over. During 2018, 2019, and 2020, T deducts a total of $90 of its 2017 net operating loss against its taxable income, and T carries over the remaining $10 of its 2017 net operating loss. In 2021, T sustains a net operating loss of $50. On December 31, 2021, P acquires all the stock of T, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $300 of consolidated taxable income in 2022 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items. The P group has no other SRLY net operating loss carryovers or CNOL carryovers.
