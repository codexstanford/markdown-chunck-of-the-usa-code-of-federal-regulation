(c)-(1)-(i)For purposes of this section and ยง 1.385-3, when a debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument as a result of a transaction in which the member of the consolidated group that issued the instrument (the issuer) or the member of the consolidated group holding the instrument (the holder) ceases to be a member of the same consolidated group but both the issuer and the holder continue to be members of the same expanded group, the issuer is treated as issuing a new debt instrument to the holder in exchange for property immediately after the debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument. To the extent the newly-issued debt instrument is a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under ยง 1.385-3(b)(3), the covered debt instrument is then immediately deemed to be exchanged for stock of the issuer. For rules regarding the treatment of the deemed exchange, see ยง 1.385-1(d). For examples illustrating the rule in this paragraph (c)(1)(i), see paragraphs (f)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section (and).
