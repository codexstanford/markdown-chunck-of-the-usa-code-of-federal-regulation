(2)-(i)For purposes of this section, it is not necessary for title to the property to have passed to the purchaser in order to have a sale. Ordinarily, a sale of property has occurred in a transaction in which title to the property has not passed to the purchaser, if the purchaser has a contractual right to retain possession of the property so long as he performs his obligations under the contract and to obtain title to the property upon the completion of the contract. However, a sale may have occurred even if the purchaser does not have the right to possession until he partially or fully satisfies the terms of the contract. For example, if S contracts to sell real property to P, and if S promises to convey title to P upon the completion of all of the payments due under the contract and to allow P to obtain possession of the property after 10 percent of the purchase price has been paid, there has been a sale on the date of the contract for purposes of this section. This section shall not apply to a disposition of real property which constituted an exchange of property or was treated as a sale under section 121(d)(4) or section 1034(i); nor shall it apply to a sale of stock in a cooperative housing corporation described in section 121(d)(3) or section 1034(f).
