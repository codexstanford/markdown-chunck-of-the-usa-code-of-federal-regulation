(C)Except for the plans in the offset arrangement, the employee has never benefited under another plan taken into account under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that is a section 401(l) plan or that satisfies section 401(a)(4) by relying on ยง 1.401(a)(4)-7. An offset arrangement does not fail the requirements of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) merely because the employee benefits under another defined benefit plan, provided no years of service taken into account under a benefit formula of any plan in the offset arrangement are also taken into account under a benefit formula of the other plan.
