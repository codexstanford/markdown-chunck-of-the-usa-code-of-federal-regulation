####### Analysis.

(ii)USP's warehouse in the United States is used in connection with sales of Product A to customers in both the United States and Country X. Thus, under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the $50x damages payment arises from an event incident to the sales of Product A and is therefore definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income ordinarily produced by the asset (the warehouse) that is involved in the event-that is, the gross income from sales of Product A by USP in the United States and by FDE in Country X. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the $50x deduction for the damages payment is apportioned for purposes of applying section 904(d) on the basis of the relative value in each grouping (as determined under ยง 1.861-9(g) for purposes of allocating and apportioning USP's interest expense) of USP's warehouse, the asset involved in the event, in 2020, the year the deduction is allowed. USP's warehouse is a multiple category asset as described in ยง 1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii) and 10% of the value of USP's warehouse is properly characterized as an asset generating foreign source foreign branch category in 2020. Accordingly, $5x (10% x $50x) of the deduction is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income. Additionally, 50% of the value of USP's warehouse is properly characterized as an asset generating foreign source general category income in 2020 and, accordingly, $25x (50% x $50x) is apportioned to such grouping. The remaining $20x (40% x $50x) is apportioned to U.S. source income.
