####### Requirements for allocation.

(2)An allocation pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) is made when an allocation document containing the following information is completed, signed, and dated by an authorized official of the Agency-

(i) The address of each building in the project, or if none exists, a specific description of the location of each building;

(ii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer receiving the allocation;

(iii) The name and address of the Agency;

(iv) The taxpayer identification number of the Agency;

(v) The date of the allocation;

(vi) The housing credit dollar amount allocated to the building or project, as applicable;

(vii) The taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project (land and depreciable basis) as of the close of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the allocation is made;

(viii) For carryover allocations made before July 1, the taxpayer's basis in the project (land and depreciable basis) as of the close of the calendar year of the allocation and the percentage that basis bears to the reasonably expected basis in the project (land and depreciable basis) as of the close of the second calendar year following the calendar year of allocation;

(ix) The date that each building in the project is expected to be placed in service; and

(x) The Building Identification Number (B.I.N.) to be assigned to each building in the project. The B.I.N. must reflect the year an allocation is first made to the building, regardless of the year that the building is placed in service. This B.I.N. must be used for all allocations of credit for the building. For example, rehabilitation expenditures treated as a separate new building under section 42(e) should not have a separate B.I.N. if the building to which the rehabilitation expenditures are made has a B.I.N. In this case, the B.I.N. used for the rehabilitation expenditures shall be the B.I.N. previously assigned to the building, although the rehabilitation expenditures must have a separate Form 8609 for the allocation. Similarly, a newly constructed building that receives an allocation of credit in different calendar years must have a separate Form 8609 for each allocation. The B.I.N. assigned to the building for the first allocation must be used for the subsequent allocation.
