####### Treatment of the allowance of the credit as a payment of interest,General rule.

(f)-(1)The holder of a qualified zone academy bond must treat the bond as if it pays qualified stated interest (within the meaning of ยง 1.1273-1(c)) on each credit allowance date. The amount of the deemed payment of interest on each credit allowance date is equal to the product of the credit rate and the outstanding principal amount of the bond on that date. Thus, for example, if the holder uses an accrual method of accounting, the holder must accrue as interest income the amount of the credit over the one-year accrual period that ends on the credit allowance date.
