###### § 31.6413(a)-3 Repayment by payor of tax erroneously collected from payee.
####### In general,Erroneous withholding under section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code.

(a)-(1)If a payor or broker withholds under section 3406 from a payee in error or withholds more than the proper amount of the tax under section 3406, the payor or broker may refund the amount erroneously withheld as provided in section 6413 and this section. A payor or broker will be considered to have withheld erroneously under section 3406 only if the amount is withheld because of an error by the payor or broker (e.g., an error in flagging or identifying an account that is subject to withholding under section 3406). The payor or broker may, in its discretion, treat the amount withheld as an amount erroneously withheld and refund it to the payee if-

(i) The payor or broker requires a payee described in § 31.3406(g)-1(a) or described in a provision of the Internal Revenue Code requiring the reporting of a payment subject to withholding under section 3406 to certify that it is an exempt recipient, the payee fails to make the required certification, and the payor or broker subsequently withholds under section 3406 from a payment to the payee;

(ii) The payor or broker does not require the payee to certify concerning its exempt status and the payor or broker withholds under section 3406;

(iii) The payor or broker withholds under section 3406 from a payee after the payee provides a taxpayer identification number or required certification (including the documentation described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii), 1.6045-1(g)(3), or 1.6049-5(c) of this chapter) to the payor, but before the payor or broker treats the number or required certification as having been received under § 31.3406(e)-1(b); or

(iv) The amount is withheld because a payor imposed backup withholding on a payment made to a person because the payee failed to furnish the documentation described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) of this chapter and the payee subsequently furnishes, completes, or corrects the documentation. The documentation must be furnished, completed, or corrected prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment is made and prior to the time the payor furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the payment for which the withholding erroneously occurred.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (other than erroneous withholding occurring under the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section), if a payor or broker withholds because the payor or broker has not received a taxpayer identifying number or required certification and the payee subsequently provides a taxpayer identifying number or a required certification to the payor, the payor or broker may not refund the amount to the payee.
