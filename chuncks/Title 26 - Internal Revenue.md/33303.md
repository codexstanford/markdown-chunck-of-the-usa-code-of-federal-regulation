####### nonparticipating contracts

(ii) For purposes of section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph, the termmeans those contracts which during the taxable year contain no right to participate in the divisible surplus of the company. For example, if at any time during the taxable year for which the deduction allowed under section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph is claimed such contracts have rights to dividends or similar distributions (as defined in section 811(a) and paragraph (a) of ยง 1.811-2), such contracts shall no longer be deemed nonparticipating contracts and, therefore, no deduction shall be allowed. Thus, if a class of contracts having no right to participate in the divisible surplus of the company is in force for nine years and on March 10, 1958, it is announced that such contracts shall be accorded dividend rights as of August 1, 1958, no deduction shall be allowed under section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph for the taxable year 1958 or any succeeding taxable year, whether or not dividends are actually paid on such contracts. However, if the announcement of March 10, 1958, states that such contracts shall be accorded dividend rights as of January 1, 1959, a deduction under section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph shall be allowed for the taxable year 1958 but not for any succeeding taxable year.
