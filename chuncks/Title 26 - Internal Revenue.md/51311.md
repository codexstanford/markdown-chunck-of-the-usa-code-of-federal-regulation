####### Consolidated compliance program,In general.,1

(ii)-(A)A participating FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group that includes one or more FFIs may elect to be part of a consolidated compliance program (and perform a consolidated periodic review) under the authority of a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution (compliance FI) that is a member of the electing FFI's expanded affiliated group, regardless of whether all such members so elect. In addition, when an FFI elects to be part of a consolidated compliance program, each branch that it maintains (including a limited branch or a branch described in ยง 1.1471-5(f)(1)), other than a branch located in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction, must be subject to periodic review as part of such program and included on the periodic certification (described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)() of this section). To the extent that a compliance FI satisfies the certification requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section on behalf of an electing FFI, such electing FFI does not have a certification requirement under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. See ยง 1.1471-5(j) for the requirement of a sponsoring entity to establish and implement a compliance program for its sponsored FFIs.
