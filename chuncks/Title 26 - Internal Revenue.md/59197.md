####### Procedure for recomputing tax liability.

(b)In determining the taxable income and the tax liability computed without the application of sections 452 and 462, such items as vacation pay and prepaid subscription income shall be reported under the law and regulations applicable to the taxable year as if such sections had not been enacted. The tax liability for the year shall be recomputed by restoring to taxable income the amount of income deferred under section 452 and the amount of the deduction taken under section 462. Other deductions or credits affected by such changes in taxable income shall be adjusted. For example, if the deduction for contributions allowed for the taxable year was limited under section 170(b), the amount of such deduction shall be recomputed, giving effect to the increase in adjusted gross income or taxable income, as the case may be, by reason of the adjustments required by the repeal of sections 452 and 462.
