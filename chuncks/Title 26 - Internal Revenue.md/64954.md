####### Notified payee underreporting and incorrect taxpayer identification number.

(ii)The payor must notify the payee under this section if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold either because of an incorrect taxpayer identification number under section 3406(a)(1)(B) (as described in § 31.3406(d)-5) or due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C) (as described in § 31.3406(c)-1). If a payor is notified by the Internal Revenue Service or a broker with respect to a readily tradable instrument, the payor may not ignore the notice even if the payee previously provided the payee's taxpayer identification number under penalties of perjury to the payor and even if the payee certified to the payor that the payee is not subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting. See § 31.3406(d)-5(c) (1) and (2) and (f)(2) for notice requirements under section 3406(a)(1)(B) due to an incorrect taxpayer identification number. See § 31.3406(c)-1(c)(2) for notice requirements under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting.
