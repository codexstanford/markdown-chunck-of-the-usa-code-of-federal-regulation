() Because the individual is not related to the father within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and ยง 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of December 15, 2019, the individual's acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)() of this section. Accordingly, assuming the unrelated individual placed the machine in service for use in its trade or business in 2019 and all other requirements of this section are satisfied, the unrelated individual's purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
