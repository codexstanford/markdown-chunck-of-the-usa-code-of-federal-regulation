####### Change initiated by the Commissioner.

(iii)A taxpayer who properly makes an election under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be considered to have made a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer, notwithstanding the provisions of ยง 1.481-1(c)(5). Thus, any of the taxpayer's "pre-1954 inventory balances" with respect to such inventory shall not be taken into account as an adjustment under section 481. For purposes of this paragraph, a "pre-1954 inventory balance" is the net amount of the adjustments which would have been required if the taxpayer had made such change in his method of accounting with respect to his inventory in his first taxable year which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. See section 481(a)(2) and ยง 1.481-3.
