(B)Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, in determining the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) that is attributable to the portion of the CFC2 Distribution with respect to each of the CFC2 stock that M1 owns on December 31, Year 2, and the CFC2 stock that M2 owns on that day, all members of the P group are treated as a single United States shareholder for purposes of determining the part of Year 2 during which such shareholder did not own such stock. In each case, the ratio of the number of days in Year 2 that such United States shareholder did not own such stock to the total number of days in Year 2 is 0/365, and the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) is $0. M1's and M2's pro rata shares of CFC2's subpart F income for Year 2 are $8x ($8x-$0) and $72x ($72x-$0), respectively, and M1 and M2 must include $8x and $72x in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A), respectively.
