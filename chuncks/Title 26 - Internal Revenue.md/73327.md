###### In General
####### ยง 301.6231(a)(6)-1 Computational adjustments.
######## Affected items that do not require partner-level determinations.

(2)Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that do not require partner-level determinations (such as the threshold amount of medical deductions under section 213 that changes as the result of determinations made at the partnership level) are computational adjustments that are directly assessed. When making computational adjustments, the Internal Revenue Service may assume that amounts the partner reported on the partner's individual return include all amounts reported to the partner by the partnership (on the Schedule K-1s attached to the partnership's original return), absent contrary notice to the Internal Revenue Service (for example, a "Notice of Inconsistent Treatment" pursuant to ยง 301.6222(a)-2(c)). Such an assumption by the Internal Revenue Service does not constitute a partner-level determination. Moreover, substituting redetermined partnership items for the partner's previously reported partnership items (including partnership items included in carryover amounts) does not constitute a partner-level determination where the Internal Revenue Service otherwise accepts, for the sole purpose of determining the computational adjustment, all nonpartnership items (including, for example, nonpartnership item components of carryover amounts) as reported.
