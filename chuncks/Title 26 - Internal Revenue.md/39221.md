(i) If the taxable year of the DISC ending on December 31, 1984, (A) is the first taxable year of the DISC which begins in 1984, (B) begins after the date in 1984 on which the taxable year of the DISC's shareholder begins, and (C) if the DISC's shareholder makes an election under section 805(b)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the deemed distribution under section 995(b) with respect to income derived by the DISC for such taxable year of the DISC shall be treated as received by the shareholder in 10 equal installments (unless the shareholder elects to be treated as receiving the deemed distribution in income over a smaller number of equal installments). The first installment shall be treated as received by the shareholder on the last day of the shareholder's second taxable year beginning in 1984 (if any), or if the shareholder had only one taxable year which began in 1984, on the last day of the shareholder's first taxable year beginning in 1985. One installment shall be treated as received by the shareholder on the last day of each succeeding taxable year of the shareholder until the entire amount of the DISC's 1984 deemed distribution has been included in the shareholder's taxable income. To make the election under section 805(b)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the DISC shareholder must attach a statement to its timely filed tax return (including extensions) for its taxable year which includes December 31, 1984, indicating the total amount of the shareholder's pro rata share of the DISC's deemed distribution for 1984 (determined under section 995(b) of the Code without regard to the election under section 805(b)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984), and the number of equal installments, if less than 10, over which the shareholder wishes to spread its pro rata share of the deemed distribution for 1984. If the election under section 805(b)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 is made, it may not be changed or revoked. In determining estimated tax payments, the portion of the deemed distribution includible in the shareholder's taxable income for any taxable year under this subdivision (i) shall be treated as received by the shareholder on the last day of such taxable year.

(ii) Except as provided in subdivision (i), the deemed distribution under section 995(b) with respect to income derived by the DISC for its taxable year ending on December 31, 1984, shall be included in the shareholder's taxable income for its taxable year which includes December 31, 1984. Thus, if the taxable year of the DISC and the DISC's shareholder both begin on January 1, 1984, and end on December 31, 1984 (or, if the taxable year of the DISC beginning in 1984 begins before the taxable year of the DISC's shareholder), the deemed distribution with respect to the DISC's taxable year ending on December 31, 1984, will be included in the DISC shareholder's taxable year ending on (or including) December 31, 1984, and the election described in subdivision (i) may not be made.

(iii) The provisions of this Question and Answer-12 apply without regard to any existence of the DISC after December 31, 1984, as an interest charge DISC.
