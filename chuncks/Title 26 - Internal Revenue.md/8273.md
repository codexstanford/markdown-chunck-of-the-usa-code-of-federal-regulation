####### Basis adjustment.

(ii)Immediately before the sale to Z, X increases its basis in the portion of the interest sold by 80 percent of the amount of the excess of the amount of the basis reduction under paragraph (h)(2) of this section ($20) over the portion of any excess business interest expense allocated the partner under paragraph (f)(2) of this section that has previously been treated under paragraph (g) of this section as business interest expense paid or accrued by X ($0). Therefore, X's basis in the portion of its interest sold is $96 (($100 x 80%) + ($20 x 80%)), and X's gain is $64 ($160-$96). Following the sale, X has $20 of outside basis in its remaining partnership interest and $4 of excess business interest expense.
