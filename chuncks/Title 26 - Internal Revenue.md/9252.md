###### ยง 1.167(b)-3 Sum of the years-digits method.
####### Applied to a single asset,General rule.

(a)-(1)Under the sum of the years-digits method annual allowances for depreciation are computed by applying changing fractions to the cost or other basis of the property reduced by estimated salvage. The numerator of the fraction changes each year to a number which corresponds to the remaining useful life of the asset (including the year for which the allowance is being computed), and the denominator which remains constant is the sum of all the years digits corresponding to the estimated useful life of the asset. See section 167(c) and ยง 1.167(c)-1 for restrictions on the use of the sum of the years-digits method.
