###### ยง 1.864(c)(8)-1 Gain or loss by foreign persons on the disposition of certain partnership interests.
####### Coordination with section 897.

(d)If a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership in a transfer that is subject to section 864(c)(8) and the partnership owns one or more United States real property interests (as defined in section 897(c)), then the foreign transferor determines its effectively connected gain and effectively connected loss under this section, and not pursuant to section 897(g). Accordingly, with respect to a transfer that is subject to section 864(c)(8), section 864(c)(8)(C) does not reduce the amount of gain or loss treated as effectively connected gain or loss under this section. For rules regarding a transfer not subject to section 864(c)(8) of an interest in a partnership that owns one or more United States real property interests, see section 897(g) and the regulations thereunder. If a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the transfer is treated as not subject to section 864(c)(8) to the extent of the gain or loss that is not recognized; instead, if the partnership owns one or more United States real property interests at the time of transfer, the rules of section 897(g) and the regulations thereunder apply to the unrecognized gain or loss.
