(ii) The percentage referred to in subdivision (i)() of this subparagraph is 66percent of the partner's proportionate interest in the general profits (or in the WIN expenses) of the partnership for the year of the apportionment under ยง 1.50B-4(a). However, once employment of an employee has been treated under this subparagraph as having terminated with respect to the partner to any extent, the percentage referred to shall be 33percent of the partner's proportionate interest in the general profits (or in the WIN expenses) of the partnership for the taxable year of the apportionment under paragraph (a) of ยง 1.50B-4.

(iii) In determining a partner's proportionate interest in the general profits (or in the WIN expenses) of a partnership for purposes of this subparagraph, the partner shall be considered to own any interest in such a partnership which he owns directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided the other entities' bases in such interests are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the partner). For example, if A, whose proportionate interest in the general profits of partnership X is 20 percent, transfers all of such interest to Corporation Y in exchange for all of the stock of Y in a transaction to which section 351 applies then, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, A shall be considered to own a 20 percent interest in partnership X. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in a partnership under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in the partnership after any such transfer or transfers.
