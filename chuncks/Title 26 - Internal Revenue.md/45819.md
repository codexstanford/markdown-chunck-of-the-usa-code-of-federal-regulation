####### Concurrent operation of section 1250(d)(7) with other provisions.

(2)Upon the disposition of a principal residence, gain computed under section 1250(a) may not be recognized in whole or in part by reason of the application of both the provisions of section 1250(d)(7) and the provisions of one of the other exceptions or limitations enumerated in section 1250(d). Thus, for example, if an entire house is transferred as a gift, and if section 1250(d)(7) applies to only a portion of the house, then section 1250(d)(1) excepts the disposition of the entire house from the application of section 1250(a).
