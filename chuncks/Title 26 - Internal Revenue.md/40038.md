####### ii,Determination of pro rata share of qualified business asset investment.

()The special rule of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply because FS's tested income of $120x is not less than FS's hypothetical tangible return of $75x, which is 10% of FS's qualified business asset investment of $750x. Accordingly, under the general rule of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, Individual A's and P Corp's respective pro rata shares of FS's qualified business asset investment bears the same ratio to FS's total qualified business asset investment as their respective pro rata shares of FS's tested income bears to FS's total tested income. Thus, Individual A's pro rata share of FS's qualified business asset investment is $75x ($750x x $12x/$120x), and P Corp's pro rata share of FS's qualified business asset investment is $675x ($750x x $108x/$120x).
