The accumulated DISC income of a DISC (but not a DISC described in section 992(a)(3)) as of December 31, 1984, is treated as previously taxed income when actually distributed after December 31, 1984. Any amounts distributed by the former DISC (including a DISC which has elected to be an interest charge DISC) after December 31, 1984, shall be treated as made first out of current earnings and profits and then out of previously taxed income to the extent thereof. For purposes of the preceding sentence, amounts distributed before July 1, 1985, shall be treated as made first out of previously taxed income to the extent thereof. If property other than money is distributed and if such property was a qualified export asset within the meaning of section 993(b) on December 31, 1984, then for purposes of section 311, no gain or loss will be recognized on the distribution and the distributee will have the same basis in the property as the distributor.
