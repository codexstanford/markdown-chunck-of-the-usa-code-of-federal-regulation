####### Determination of principal purpose and transitory holding,Presumption for ownership less than 12 months.

(iv)-(A)For purposes of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, specified tangible property is presumed to be acquired temporarily with a principal purpose of increasing the deemed tangible income return of an applicable U.S. shareholder for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year if the property is held by the acquiring CFC for less than 12 months and the holding of the property by the acquiring CFC as of the tested quarter close would have the effect of increasing the deemed tangible income return of the applicable U.S. shareholder for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year. The presumption described in the preceding sentence may be rebutted only if the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the subsequent transfer of the property by the acquiring CFC was not contemplated when the property was acquired by the acquiring CFC and that a principal purpose of the acquisition of the property was not to increase the deemed tangible income return of the applicable U.S. shareholder for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year. In order to rebut the presumption, a statement must be attached to the Form 5471 filed by the taxpayer for the taxable year of the CFC in which the subsequent transfer occurs and include any information required by applicable administrative announcements, forms or instructions. The statement must explain the facts and circumstances supporting the rebuttal and be in accordance with any rules provided in forms and instructions.
