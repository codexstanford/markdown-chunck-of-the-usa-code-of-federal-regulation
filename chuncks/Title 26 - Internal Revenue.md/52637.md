() The P group's deduction of T's 2021 net operating loss is subject to both a SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation under section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii). Therefore, the total limitation on the use of T's 2021 net operating loss in the P group is $48 (the remaining cumulative register of $60 x 80 percent). No losses from equivalent years are available, and the P group otherwise has sufficient consolidated taxable income to support the CNOL deduction ($290 x 80 percent = $232). Therefore, $48 of T's 2021 SRLY net operating loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for 2022. The remaining $2 of T's 2021 SRLY net operating loss ($50-$48) is carried over to the P group's 2023 consolidated return year.
