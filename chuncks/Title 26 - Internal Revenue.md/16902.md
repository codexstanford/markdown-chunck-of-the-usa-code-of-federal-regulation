####### Ten-percent shareholder.

(14)A person will be considered a ten-percent shareholder of a corporation the stock of which is listed on an established market if the person owns, actually or constructively under the rules of section 318 (without regard to section 318(a)(4)), ten percent or more of any class of stock of the corporation whose stock is transferred. A person will be considered a ten-percent shareholder of a corporation the stock of which is not listed on an established market if the person owns stock possessing ten percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of the corporation whose stock is transferred or stock having a value equal to ten percent or more of the total value of the stock of the corporation whose stock is transferred. For purposes of determining whether a person owns ten percent or more of the total voting power or value of the stock of the corporation whose stock is transferred, the person shall be treated as owning the stock that such person owns actually and constructively under the rules of section 318 (without regard to section 318(a)(4)). In addition, if the exercise of an option (whether by itself or in conjunction with the deemed exercise of one or more other options) would cause the holder to become a ten-percent shareholder, then the option will be treated as exercised. Absent actual knowledge that a person is a ten-percent shareholder, a corporation the stock of which is listed on an established market can rely on Schedules 13D and 13G (or any similar schedules) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to identify its ten-percent shareholders.
