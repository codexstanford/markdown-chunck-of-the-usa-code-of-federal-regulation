(viii)A withholding agent may rely on the information and certifications stated on withholding certificates or other documentation without having to inquire into the veracity of this information or certification, unless it has actual knowledge or reason to know that the information or certification is incorrect. In the case of amounts described in § 1.1441-6(c)(2), a withholding agent described in § 1.1441-7(b)(3) has reason to know that the information or certifications on a certificate are incorrect only to the extent provided in § 1.1441-7(b)(4) through (6). See § 1.1441-6(b)(1) for reliance on representations regarding eligibility for a reduced rate under an income tax treaty. Paragraphs (e)(4)(viii)(A) and (B) of this section provide examples of such reliance.
