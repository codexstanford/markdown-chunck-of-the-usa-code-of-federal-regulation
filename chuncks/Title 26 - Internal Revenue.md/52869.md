####### Items taken into account in open years.

(D)An amendment to an election made pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section affects the group's items of income, gain, deduction, or loss only to the extent that the amendment gives rise, directly or indirectly, to items or amounts that would properly be taken into account in a year for which an assessment of deficiency or a refund for overpayment, as the case may be, is not prevented by any law or rule of law. Under this paragraph, if the year to which a loss previously deemed to expire as a result of an election made pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section is deemed not to expire as a result of an election made pursuant to this paragraph would have been carried back or carried forward is a year for which a refund of overpayment is prevented by law, then to the extent that the absorption of such loss in such year would have affected the tax treatment of another item (e.g., another loss that was absorbed in such year) that has an effect in a year for which a refund of overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of law, the amendment to the election made pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section will affect the treatment of such other item. Therefore, if the absorption of such loss (the first loss) in a year for which a refund of overpayment is prevented by law would have prevented the absorption of another loss (the second loss) in such year and such second loss would have been carried to and used in a year for which a refund of overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of law (the other year), the amendment of the election makes the second loss available for use in the other year.
