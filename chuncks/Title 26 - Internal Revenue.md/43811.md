(B)As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (), the portion of these modifications that implements the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of the debt instrument. However, the portion of these modifications that modifies customary financial covenants is not related to the replacement of LIBOR and, therefore, is not described in any of paragraphs (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and, therefore, is a noncovered modification of the debt instrument. Moreover, the portion of these modifications that adds 30 basis points to the rate changes the amount of cash flows on the debt instrument, and the parties intend that change to compensate L for a modification to the debt instrument not described in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section (the modification of customary financial covenants). Therefore, the portion of these modifications that adds those 30 basis points to the rate is described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section and, consequently, is a noncovered modification of the debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
