Except as otherwise provided by Federal statute (see paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of ยง 301.6362-7), in applying such provisions of the State tax laws:

(1) In the case of a resident tax, an individual shall be subject to the current collection provisions if either-

(ii) He has his principal place of residence (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within the State,

(2) In the case of a nonresident tax, an individual shall be subject to the current collection provisions if he does not meet either description relating to an individual in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f), if he is not exempt from liability for the tax by reason for a reciprocal agreement between the State of which he is a resident and the State imposing the tax, and if it is reasonable to expect him to receive wage or other business income derived from sources within the State imposing the tax (as defined in paragraph (d) of ยง 301.6362-5) for services performed on 30 days or more of the taxable year.
