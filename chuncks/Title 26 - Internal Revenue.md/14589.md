##### Items Not Deductible
###### ยง 1.263A-11 Accumulated production expenditures.
####### Related person costs.

(g)The activities of a related person are taken into account in applying the classification thresholds under ยง 1.263A-8(b)(1)(ii)(B) and (C), and in determining the production period of a unit of designated property under ยง 1.263A-12. However, only those costs incurred by the taxpayer are taken into account in the taxpayer's accumulated production expenditures under this section because the related person includes its own capitalized costs in the related person's accumulated production expenditures with respect to any unit of designated property upon which the parties engage in mutual production activities. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the accumulated production expenditures of any property transferred to a taxpayer in a nontaxable transaction are treated as accumulated production expenditures incurred by the taxpayer.
