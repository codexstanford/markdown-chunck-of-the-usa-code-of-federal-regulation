###### ยง 1.279-3 Corporate acquisition indebtedness.
####### Direct or indirect consideration.

(2)Obligations are issued to provide direct consideration for an acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1) where the obligations are issued to the shareholders of an acquired corporation in exchange for stock in such acquired corporation or where the obligations are issued to the acquired corporation in exchange for its assets. The application of the provisions of this subsection relating to indirect consideration for an acquisition of stock or assets depends upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the acquisition and the issuance of the obligations. Obligations are issued to provide indirect consideration for an acquisition of stock or assets within the meaning of section 279(b)(1) where (i) at the time of the issuance of the obligations the issuing corporation anticipated the acquisition of such stock or assets and the obligations would not have been issued if the issuing corporation had not so anticipated such acquisition, or where (ii) at the time of the acquisition the issuing corporation foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen that it would be required to issue obligations, which it would not have otherwise been required to issue if the acquisition had not occurred, in order to meet its future economic needs.
