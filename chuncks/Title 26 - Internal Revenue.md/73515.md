######## Example 2.

(B)B loans Partnership $100 in Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Partnership makes an interest payment to B in 2020 of $5. Partnership's liability relating to the loan by B to Partnership and the $5 of interest expense paid by the Partnership are items or amounts that are with respect to Partnership because they were shown on Partnership's return and are relevant in determining the liability of any person under chapter 1 pursuant to paragraphs (a)(6)(iii) and (iv) of this section. However, the treatment of the loan by B and the amount of interest income received by B are not items or amounts with respect to Partnership under paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section because although they relate to a transaction with or liability of Partnership and Partnership's treatment of the loan is shown on Partnership's return, B's treatment of the loan and the amount of interest income to B are shown, or required to be shown, on the return of B, a person other than Partnership and require determinations about B's reporting of the items. Accordingly, the loan as treated by B and the amount of interest income to B is not a partnership-related item.
