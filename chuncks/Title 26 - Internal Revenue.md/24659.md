####### Example 8: Insurance contract renewals,Facts.

(viii)-(A)J, an insurance agent, is engaged by an insurance carrier to sell insurance. Pursuant to the contract between J and the insurance carrier, J is entitled to receive a $50 commission from the insurance carrier at the time a policy is sold to a customer. The contract also provides that J is entitled to receive an additional $25 commission each time a policy is renewed. J does not have an enforceable right to a renewal commission if the insurance carrier terminates the contract before a policy is renewed. J sells 1,000 one-year policies in 2021, of which 800 are expected to be renewed in 2022 and 700 are expected to be renewed in 2023. J does not have any ongoing obligation to provide additional services to the insurance carrier or the customers after the initial sale of the policy. For its AFS, J reports $87,500 of AFS revenue for 2021, which includes $50,000 ($50 x 1,000) of commission income for policies sold in 2021 and an estimate of $37,500 ($25 x 1,500) of commission income for the policies expected to be renewed in 2022 and 2023.
