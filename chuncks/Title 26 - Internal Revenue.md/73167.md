######## Interest,Interest on the correction amounts.,applicable taxable year

(c)-(1)Interest on the correction amounts determined under paragraph (b) of this section is the aggregate of all interest calculated for each applicable taxable year in which there was a correction amount greater than zero at the rate set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For each applicable taxable year, interest on the correction amount is calculated from the due date (without extension) of the reviewed year partner's return for such applicable taxable year until the amount is paid. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the termmeans the reviewed year partner's taxable year affected by taking into account adjustments as described in paragraph (b) of this section (for instance, the first affected year and any intervening year in which there is a correction amount greater than zero). For purposes of calculating interest under this paragraph (c), a correction amount under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section for an applicable taxable year that is less than zero does not reduce the correction amount for any other applicable taxable year.
