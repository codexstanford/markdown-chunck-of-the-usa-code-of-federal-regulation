####### Amount of recovery.

(a)The amount of recovery for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1332(a). See paragraph (a) of ยง 1.1332-1. If, pursuant to the taxpayer's election under section 1335, the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable year in which he recovers the same war loss property, the fair market value of such property shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be considered an amount equal to the adjusted basis (for determining loss) of such property in the hands of the taxpayer on the date such property was considered as destroyed or seized. This option is exercisable by the taxpayer with respect to each separate war loss property. Also, if the provisions of section 1333 are applicable pursuant to the taxpayer's election, the amount of the recovery of any money or property in respect of war loss property shall be reduced for the purpose of section 1333 (2) and (3) by the amount of the obligations or liabilities with respect to such property, if the taxpayer for any previous taxable year chose under section 127(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to treat such obligations or liabilities as discharged or satisfied out of such property, and such obligations or liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied before the date of the recovery. See 26 CFR (1939) 29.127(b)-1 (Regulations 111).
