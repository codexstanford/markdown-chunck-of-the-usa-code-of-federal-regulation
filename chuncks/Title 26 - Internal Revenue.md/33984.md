(2)Under section 856(c)(6)(C), the term "interests in real property" includes options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land and improvements thereon. However, where a corporation, trust, or association writes an option giving the holder the right to acquire land or improvements thereon, or writes an option giving the holder the right to acquire a leasehold of land or improvements thereon, any income that the corporation, trust, or association recognizes because the option expires unexercised is not considered to be gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including interests in real property) for purposes of section 856(c) (2)(D) and (3)(C). The rule in the preceding sentence also applies for purposes of section 856(c)(4)(C) in determining gain from the sale or other disposition of real property for the 30-percent-of-gross-income limitation.
