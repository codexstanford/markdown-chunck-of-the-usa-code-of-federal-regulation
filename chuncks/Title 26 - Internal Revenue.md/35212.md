####### 3,Apportionment based on gross receipts,i,In general.

()-()After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $25,000x ($50,000x-$25,000x) of R&E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Because X has licensed its intangible property related to the SIC code to U and U has licensed it to the sub-licensees, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, gross receipts from sales of U's sublicensees are taken into account in apportioning X's R&E expenditures. Although X has gross intangible income of $300,000x from domestic sales of services and $5,000x in royalties from U, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of services by X and U's sub-licensees (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings.
