###### ยง 1.1502-77 Agent for the group.
####### Agent for each consolidated return year.

(2)Agency for the group is established for each consolidated return year and is not affected by the status or membership of the group in later years. Thus, subject to the rules of paragraph (c) of this section, the agent will generally remain agent for that consolidated return year regardless of whether one or more subsidiaries later cease to be members of the group, whether the group files a consolidated return for any subsequent year, whether the agent ceases to be the agent or a member of the group in any subsequent year, or whether the group continues pursuant to ยง 1.1502-75(d) with a new common parent in any subsequent year.
