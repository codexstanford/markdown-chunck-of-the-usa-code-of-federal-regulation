####### ยง 301.6225-1 Partnership adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.
######## Treatment of adjustment as zero for purposes of calculating the imputed underpayment.

(4)If the effect of one partnership adjustment is reflected in one or more other partnership adjustments, the IRS may treat the one adjustment as zero solely for purposes of calculating the imputed underpayment. In addition, if a positive adjustment to an item is related to, or results from, a positive adjustment to another item, one of the positive adjustments will generally be treated as zero solely for purposes of calculating any imputed underpayment unless the IRS determines that an adjustment should not be treated as zero in the calculation of the imputed underpayment. This paragraph applies to the calculation of any imputed underpayment, including imputed underpayments calculated by a partnership or pass-through partner (for example, as part of the filing of an administrative adjustment request (AAR) under section 6227).
