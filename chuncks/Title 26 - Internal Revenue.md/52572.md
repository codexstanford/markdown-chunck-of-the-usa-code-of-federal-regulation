()If, for any reason, a member's portion of a CNOL is absorbed or reduced on a non-pro rata basis (for example, under ยง 1.1502-11(b) or (c), paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, ยง 1.1502-28, or 1.1502-36(d), or as the result of a carryback to a separate return year), the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member is recomputed. In addition, if a member with a separate net operating loss ceases to be a member, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each remaining member is recomputed. The recomputed percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member equals the remaining CNOL attributable to the member at the time of the recomputation divided by the sum of the remaining CNOL attributable to all of the remaining members at the time of the recomputation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(), a CNOL that is permanently disallowed or eliminated is treated as absorbed.
