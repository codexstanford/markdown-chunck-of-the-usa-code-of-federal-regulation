####### Years to which losses may be carried.

(3)The taxable years to which a net operating loss shall be carried back or carried over are prescribed by section 172(b)(1).

This rule applies even though the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer is a period of less than twelve months.
