###### ยง 1.163(j)-2 Deduction for business interest expense limited.
####### Analysis.

(ii)Because X and Y are under common control, they must aggregate gross receipts for purposes of section 448(c) and the small business exemption in ยง 1.163(j)-2(d). See section 448(c)(2). Therefore, X and Y are both considered to have $27 million in average annual gross receipts for 2020. X and Y must separately apply section 163(j) to determine any limitation on the deduction for business interest expense. Assuming X otherwise meets the requirements in ยง 1.163(j)-9 in 2020, X may elect for its farming business to be an excepted trade or business.
