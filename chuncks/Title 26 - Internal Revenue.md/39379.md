####### Tax accounting standards,In general.

(f)-(1)A dual filing taxpayer must use the same tax accounting standards on the returns filed with the United States and the Virgin Islands. A taxpayer who has filed a return only with the United States or only with the Virgin Islands as a single filing taxpayer for a prior taxable year and is required to file a return only with the other jurisdiction as a single filing taxpayer for a later taxable year may not, for such later taxable year, use different tax accounting standards unless the second jurisdiction consents to such change. However, such change will not be effective for returns filed thereafter with the first jurisdiction unless before such later date of filing the taxpayer also obtains the consent of the first jurisdiction to make such change. Any request for consent to make a change pursuant to this paragraph (f) must be made to the office where the return is required to be filed under paragraph (e) of this section and in sufficient time to permit a copy of the consent to be attached to the return for the taxable year.
