###### § 1.1471-5 Definitions applicable to section 1471.
####### Currency translation of balance or value.

(iv)If the balance or value of a financial account, other obligation, or the aggregate amount payable under a group life or group annuity contract described in § 1.1471-4(c)(4) is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, a withholding agent must calculate the balance or value by applying a spot rate determined under § 1.988-1(d) to translate such balance or value into the U.S. dollar equivalent. For the purpose of a participating or registered deemed-compliant FFI reporting an account under § 1.1471-4(d), the spot rate must be determined as of the last day of the calendar year (or, in the case of an insurance contract or annuity contract, the most recent contract anniversary date, when applicable) for which the account is being reported or, if the account was closed during such calendar year, the date the account was closed. In the case of an FFI determining whether an account meets (or continues to meet) a preexisting account documentation exception described in § 1.1471-4(c)(3)(iii) or (c)(5)(iii), or whether the account is an account described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the spot rate must be determined on the date for which the FFI is determining the threshold amount as prescribed in those provisions.
