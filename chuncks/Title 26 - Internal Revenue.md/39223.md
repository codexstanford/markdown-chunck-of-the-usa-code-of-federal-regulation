####### A-12A:

No. Under section 805(b)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, if the DISC's deemed distribution for its taxable year which ended on December 31, 1984, is a qualified distribution, the shareholders of the DISC are permitted to make an election to treat the distribution as received over a 10-year period. The 10-year treatment applies even though the amount of the deemed distribution is distributed to the DISC's shareholders prior to the period in which the distribution is taken into income by the shareholders. In addition, under section 996(e) of the Code, the shareholder's basis in the stock of the DISC will be considered as increased, as of the date of liquidation, by the shareholder's pro rata share of the amount of the undistributed qualified distribution even though that amount is treated as received by the shareholder in later years. Further, the actual distribution in liquidation of the former DISC after 1984 will increase the earnings and profits of a corporate distributee, and the amount actually distributed shall be treated under the rules of section 996.
