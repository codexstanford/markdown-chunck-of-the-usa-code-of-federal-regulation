####### In general.

(a)For purposes of this section, a fund established and maintained by an individual who holds, has been elected to, or is a candidate (within the meaning of section 41(c)(2)) for nomination or election to, any Federal, State, or local elective public office for the use by such individual exclusively for an exempt function, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be a newsletter fund. If assets of a newsletter fund are used for any purpose other than the exempt function of the newsletter fund as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, such amount shall be treated as expended for the personal use of the individual who established and maintained such fund. In addition, future contributions to such fund are treated as income to the individual who established and maintained the fund. In such a case, the facts and circumstances may indicate that the fund was never established and maintained exclusively for an exempt function as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
