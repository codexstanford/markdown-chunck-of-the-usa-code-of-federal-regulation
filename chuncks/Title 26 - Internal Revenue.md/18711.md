###### § 1.382-3 Definitions and rules relating to a 5-percent shareholder.
####### Secondary transfer exception.

(13)The segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) will not apply to the transfer of a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation by a first tier entity or an individual that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation to public shareholders. Instead, each public group existing at the time of the transfer will be treated under § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) as acquiring its proportionate share of the stock exempted from the application of § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i). The segregation rules also will not apply if an ownership interest in an entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)) is transferred to a public owner or a 5-percent owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation. Instead, provided that the transferor is either a 5-percent owner that is a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation or a higher tier entity owning five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of section 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)), each public group of the entity existing at the time of the transfer is treated under § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) as acquiring its proportionate share of the transferred ownership interest. With regard to a transferor that is neither a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation nor a higher tier entity owning five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)), see generally § 1.382-2T(e)(1)(ii) (disregarding these transactions if the transferee is not a 5-percent shareholder).
