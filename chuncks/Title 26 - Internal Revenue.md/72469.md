######## Procedure for obtaining an ATIN.,Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending Adoptions

(2)If the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, the prospective adoptive parent may apply for an ATIN for a child on Form W-7A,(or such other form as may be prescribed by the IRS). An application for an ATIN should be made far enough in advance of the first intended use of the ATIN to permit issuance of the ATIN in time for such use. An application for an ATIN must include the information required by the form and accompanying instructions, including the name and address of each prospective adoptive parent and the child's name and date of birth. In addition, the application must include such documentary evidence as the IRS may prescribe to establish that a child was placed in the prospective adoptive parent's household by an authorized placement agency for legal adoption. Examples of acceptable documentary evidence establishing placement for legal adoption by an authorized placement agency may include-

(i) A copy of a placement agreement entered into between the prospective adoptive parent and an authorized placement agency;

(ii) An affidavit or letter signed by the adoption attorney or government official who placed the child for legal adoption pursuant to state law;

(iii) A document authorizing the release of a newborn child from a hospital to a prospective adoptive parent for adoption; and

(iv) A court document ordering or approving the placement of a child for adoption.
