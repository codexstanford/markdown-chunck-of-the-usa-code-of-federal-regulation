####### Reliance on a prior version of a withholding certificate.

(C)Upon the issuance by the IRS of an updated version of a withholding certificate, a withholding agent may continue to accept the prior version of the withholding certificate until the later of six full months after the revision date shown on the updated withholding certificate or the end of the calendar year the updated withholding certificate is issued, unless the IRS has issued guidance that indicates that the period for accepting a prior version is shortened or extended (including in the instructions to the form), such as when there is a new payee status required to be established using the form. A withholding agent may continue to rely upon a previously signed prior version of the withholding certificate until its period of validity expires.
