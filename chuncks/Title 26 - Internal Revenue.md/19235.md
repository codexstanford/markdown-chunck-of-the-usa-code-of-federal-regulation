() USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because it is an exempt exchange (as defined in paragraph (g)(11) of this section). USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is an exempt exchange because USS1 and USS2 are both parties to an asset reorganization, section 1032 applies to USS1, the transferor of the USS1 stock, and the USS1 stock is distributed by USS2, the transferee, pursuant to the plan of reorganization. Furthermore, USS2's acquisition of its own stock from FS is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because USS2 acquires its stock in exchange for USS1 stock.
