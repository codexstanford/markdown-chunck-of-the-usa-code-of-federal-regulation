###### ยง 1.614-3 Rules relating to separate operating mineral interests in the case of mines.
####### Invalid basic aggregations.,invalid basic aggregations

(ii)The termrefers to aggregations which are initially invalid. Generally, a basic aggregation is initially invalid because it does not include all the separate operating mineral interests which comprise a complete mine or mines or because it includes separate operating mineral interests which are not part of the same operating unit. If the taxpayer makes an invalid basic aggregation, each of the separate operating mineral interests included in such aggregation shall be treated as a separate property for the first taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any such interest in a different manner. Consent will be granted in appropriate cases. For example, assume that the taxpayer elects to form an aggregation of the operating mineral interests which comprise one or more complete mines. If the taxpayer demonstrates that he inadvertently failed to include a minor part of one of the aggregated mines or inadvertently included a minor part of another mine that is not a part of the aggregation, consent will ordinarily be granted to maintain the aggregation by including the part omitted or by excluding the part included. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:
