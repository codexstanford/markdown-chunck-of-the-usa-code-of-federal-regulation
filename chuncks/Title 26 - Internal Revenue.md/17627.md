###### ยง 1.367(a)-8 Gain recognition agreement requirements.
####### Alternate facts.,Example 6

(C)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (q)(2)(vi)(A) of this section (the facts in this), including that paragraph (k)(14) of this section applies to the year 3 reorganization so that USP enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer of the TFD stock that occurred in year 1 (GRA 1), and that under ยง 1.367(a)-3(e) USP enters into a separate gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer of the TFC stock by UST to FA pursuant to the year 3 asset reorganization (GRA 2). Assume further that in year 4 TFC disposes of 10% of the TFD stock pursuant to a transaction that constitutes a triggering event with respect to GRA 1. The disposition of the TFD stock is not a triggering event with respect to GRA 2 because the TFD stock disposed of does not constitute substantially all the assets of TFC. Under paragraphs (j)(1) and (c)(1)(i) of this section, USP must recognize $5x gain (10% of $50x) under GRA 1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, as of the date of the initial transfer (with respect to which GRA 1 was filed), the basis of the TFC stock and TFD stock, respectively, is increased by $5x. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the amount of gain subject to GRA 1 is reduced from $50x to $45x. Similarly, because the transferred stock for purposes of GRA 2 is the TFC stock, the amount of gain subject to GRA 2 is reduced from $100x to $95x to reflect the increase to the basis of the TFC stock.
