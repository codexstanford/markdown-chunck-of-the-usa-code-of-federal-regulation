####### Plans benefiting collectively bargained employees.

(7)A plan that benefits solely collectively bargained employees for a plan year satisfies this paragraph (b)(7) for the plan year. If a plan (within the meaning of ยง 1.410(b)-7(b)) benefits both collectively bargained employees and noncollectively bargained employees for a plan year, ยง 1.410(b)-7(c)(4) provides that the portion of the plan that benefits collectively bargained employees is treated as a separate plan from the portion of the plan that benefits noncollectively bargained employees. Thus, the mandatorily disaggregated portion of the plan that benefits the collectively bargained employees automatically satisfies this paragraph (b)(7) for the plan year and hence section 410(b). See ยง 1.410(b)-9 for the definitions of collectively bargained employee and noncollectively bargained employee.
