####### Assets of transferred corporation.

(iii)If substantially all of the assets of the transferred corporation are transferred to a foreign or domestic acquiring corporation in a section 361 exchange that is pursuant to an asset reorganization, the exchanges made pursuant to the asset reorganization shall not constitute triggering events if the U.S. transferor enters into a new gain recognition agreement that, unless the acquiring corporation is the transferee foreign corporation, designates the acquiring corporation as the transferred corporation for purposes of this section. Only the assets of the transferred corporation received by the acquiring corporation shall be treated as assets of the transferred corporation for purposes of this section (for example, only such assets will be taken into account for purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section). For an illustration of the rule provided by this paragraph, see paragraph (q)(2)(viii) of this section. If the transferred corporation is domestic, see section 367(a)(1) and (a)(5), and paragraph (o)(4) of this section. If the transfer is pursuant to a triangular asset reorganization, see paragraph (k)(14) of this section.
