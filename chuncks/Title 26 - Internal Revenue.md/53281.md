###### ยง 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Example 1.

(i)P owns all of the stock of L and S. S owns all of the stock of I, a nonlife member that is an ineligible corporation for 2021 under paragraph (b)(13) of this section. For 2021, the group elects under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return. For 2021, assume that any nonlife consolidated net operating loss may not be carried back to a prior taxable year. Other facts are summarized in the following table.

Under paragraph (h)(3)(vi) of this section, P's separate income is considered to absorb the loss of S, an eligible member, first and the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss is zero, that is, the consolidated net operating loss ($100) reduced by I's loss ($100). The consolidated net operating loss ($100) may be carried over, but since it is entirely attributable to I (an ineligible member that is not a nonlife insurance company) its use is subject to the restrictions in paragraph (h)(3)(vi) of this section and section 172(a). The result would be the same if the group contained two additional members, S, an eligible member, and I, an ineligible member, where Shad a loss of ($100) and Ihad income of $100.
