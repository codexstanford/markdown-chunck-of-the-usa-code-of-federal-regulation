####### Capital gain.

(a)The determinations under section 1222, including capital gain net income, net long-term capital gain, and net capital gain, with respect to members during consolidated return years are not made separately. Instead, consolidated amounts are determined for the group as a whole. The consolidated capital gain net income for any consolidated return year is determined by reference to-

(1) The aggregate gains and losses of members from sales or exchanges of capital assets for the year (other than gains and losses to which section 1231 applies);

(2) The consolidated net section 1231 gain for the year (determined under ยง 1.1502-23); and

(3) The net capital loss carryovers or carrybacks to the year.
