() Neither the interest in Partnership A nor B is a QPI. Organization D's interest in Partnership A does not meet the requirements of either the de minimis test or the participation test because it owns 50 percent of the interest in the partnership. Organization D's indirect interest in Partnership B (50 percent of 30 percent, or 15 percent) does not meet the de minimis test. Additionally, because Partnership A owns greater than 20 percent interest in Partnership B, Partnership A's interest in Partnership B does not meet the participation test. However, Organization D's interest in Partnership C is a QPI because Partnership C meets the participation test. That is, Partnership B holds a 15 percent interest in Partnership C and does not significantly participate in Partnership C.
