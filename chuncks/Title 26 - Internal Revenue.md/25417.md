###### ยง 1.460-5 Cost allocation rules.
####### Components and subassemblies.,e.g.,

(ii)The costs of a component or subassembly (component) produced by the taxpayer must be allocated to a long-term contract as the taxpayer incurs costs to produce the component if the taxpayer reasonably expects to incorporate the component into the subject matter of the contract. Similarly, the cost of a purchased component (including a component purchased from a related party) must be allocated to a long-term contract as the taxpayer incurs the cost to purchase the component if the taxpayer reasonably expects to incorporate the component into the subject matter of the contract. In all other cases, the cost of a component must be allocated to a long-term contract when the component is dedicated, under principles similar to those in ยง 1.263A-11(b)(2). A taxpayer maintaining inventories under ยง 1.471-1 must determine allocable contract costs attributable to components using its method of accounting for those inventories (FIFO, LIFO, specific identification).
