(10)(i) The term "qualified rehabilitation loan" means any owner financing provided in connection with-

(A) A qualified rehabilitation, or

(B) The acquisition of a residence with respect to which there has been a qualified rehabilitation,

(ii) The term "qualified rehabilitation" means any rehabilitation of a residence if-

(A) There is a period of at least 20 years between the date on which the building was first used and the date on which physical work on such rehabilitation begins,

(B) 75 percent or more of the existing external walls of such building are retained in place as external walls in the rehabilitation process, and

(C) The expenditures for such rehabilitation are 25 percent or more of the mortgagor's adjusted basis in the residence (including the land on which the residence is located).

(iii) For purposes of (A) and (B), the rules applicable to the investment tax credit for qualified rehabilitated buildings under section 48(g)(1) (A)(iii) and (B) shall apply. However, unlike section 48(g)(1)(B), once a building meets the 20-year test, more than one rehabilitation of that building within a 20-year period may qualify as a qualified rehabilitation.
