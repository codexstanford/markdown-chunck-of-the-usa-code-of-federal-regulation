####### Analysis.

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), K is required to include $30,000 in gross income in 2021 as K has a fixed right to receive $30,000 for the 2021 rental period under the terms of the lease agreement. Under the AFS income inclusion rule, although K reports $33,154 of AFS revenue for 2021, K has an enforceable right to recover only $30,000 if the tenant were to cancel the lease on the last day of 2021. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, of the $33,154 of AFS revenue reported for 2021, only $30,000 is treated as "taken into account in AFS revenue" under the AFS income inclusion rule. As a result, K is required to include $30,000 in gross income in 2021.
