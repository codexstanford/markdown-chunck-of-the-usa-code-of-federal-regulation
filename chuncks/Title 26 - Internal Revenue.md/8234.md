###### ยง 1.163(j)-6 Application of the section 163(j) limitation to partnerships and subchapter S corporations.
####### Partnerships and S corporations not subject to section 163(j),Exempt partnerships and S corporations.,Example 11,Example 12

(m)-(1)If the small business exemption in ยง 1.163(j)-2(d) applies to a partnership or an S corporation in a taxable year (exempt entity), the general rule in ยง 1.163(j)-2 and this section does not apply to limit the deduction for business interest expense of the exempt entity in that taxable year. Additionally, if a partner or S corporation shareholder is allocated business interest expense from an exempt entity, such business interest expense is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the partner's or S corporation shareholder's level. However, see paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Further, a partner or S corporation shareholder of an exempt entity includes its share of non-excepted trade or business items of income, gain, loss, and deduction (including business interest expense and business interest income) of such exempt entity when calculating its ATI. However, if a partner's or S corporation shareholder's allocations of non-excepted trade or business items of loss and deduction from an exempt entity exceed its allocations of non-excepted trade or business items of income and gain from such exempt entity (net loss allocation), then such net loss allocation will not reduce a partner's or S corporation shareholder's ATI. Seeandin paragraphs (o)(11) and (12) of this section, respectively.
