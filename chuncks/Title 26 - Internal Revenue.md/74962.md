######## Example 4.

(iv)In calendar year 2024, Corporation W timely electronically files 25 Forms 1099-B (relating to proceeds from broker and barter exchange transactions) with incorrect information. On August 1, 2024, Corporation W discovers the errors and files 25 corrected Forms 1099-B on paper. Under ยง 301.6011-2(c)(4)(ii)(A), a person required to file an original information return covered by ยง 301.6011-2(b) electronically must file any corrected information return corresponding to that original return electronically. Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a failure to file a corrected information return electronically when required to do so is a failure to correct the corresponding original information return. As Corporation W was required to file its 25 corrected information returns electronically, it has failed to correct the original information returns and is subject to a penalty of $6,250 for failure to include correct information on its 25 original Forms 1099-B ($250 x 25 = $6,250), without any reductions for correcting the information on or before August 1.
