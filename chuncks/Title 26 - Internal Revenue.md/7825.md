()-()The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(B)() of this section, except that, rather than sell all of its S stock to an unrelated third party in 2024, P transfers all of its S stock to T in 2024 in a transaction to which section 351 applies and, in 2025, P sells all of its T stock to an unrelated third party at a gain of $40x. As provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A)() of this section, P's intercompany transfer of its S stock to T is not a "sale or other disposition" for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section. Thus, no adjustment to tentative taxable income is required in 2024 under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section.
