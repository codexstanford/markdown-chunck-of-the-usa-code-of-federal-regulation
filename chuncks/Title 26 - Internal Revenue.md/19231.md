####### Analysis.,1

(B)() USS2 is a predecessor of DS2 under paragraph (g)(20)(i)(B) of this section and DS2 is a successor to USS2 under paragraph (g)(24)(i)(B) of this section because USS2 is the distributing corporation and DS2 is the controlled corporation in a distribution to which section 355 applies. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, a distribution by DS2 is treated as a distribution by USS2. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(3)(v)(B) of this section, USS2 Note is treated as funding the distribution by DS2 to FP because USS2 Note was issued during the per se period with respect to DS2's $200x cash distribution, and because both the issuance of USS2 Note and the distribution by DS2 occur during the per se period with respect to the section 355 distribution. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, USS2 Note is treated as stock beginning on Date C in Year 3. See ยง 1.385-1(d) for rules regarding the treatment of this deemed exchange.
