####### Adjustments to basis of assets to account for direct allocations.

(4)In determining the amount of a taxpayer's basis in the assets used in its excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, adjustments must be made to reflect direct allocations under this paragraph (d). These adjustments consist of reductions in the taxpayer's basis in its assets for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section to reflect assets to which interest expense is directly allocated under this paragraph (d). The amount of the taxpayer's basis in these assets must be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of qualified nonrecourse indebtedness secured by these assets. These adjustments must be made before the taxpayer averages the adjusted basis in its assets as determined on each determination date during the taxable year.
