###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Equipment #5 ceases to be eligible property.

(iv)The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, except that, on June 1, 2019, Equipment #5 is no longer eligible property. The Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule does not apply because B's acquisition of Equipment #5 fails to satisfy the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section that the acquired eligible property continue to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date. Therefore, B's acquisition of Equipment #5 on January 1, 2019, fails to satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. Under the Group Prior Use Rule, B is treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #5 because B is a member of the Parent group and S, while a member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #5 within the lookback period. Accordingly, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction with respect to Equipment #5 in 2019.
