###### ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1 Inclusion of gains that have been deferred under section 1400Z-2(a).
####### Partnership distributions.

(iii)Subject to paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, an actual or deemed distribution of property, including cash, by a QOF partnership to a partner with respect to its qualifying investment is an inclusion event only to the extent that the distributed property has a fair market value in excess of the partner's basis in its qualifying investment. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii), in the case of a merger or consolidation of a QOF partnership with another QOF partnership in a transaction to which section 708(b)(2)(A) applies, the fair market value of the distributed property is reduced by the fair market value of the QOF partnership interest received in the merger or consolidation. A distribution from a partnership that directly or indirectly owns a QOF is an inclusion event only if the distribution is a liquidating distribution. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii), the distribution is not in complete liquidation if the partnership making the distribution is a partnership that terminates in a partnership merger or consolidation under ยง 1.708-1(c), the continuing partnership in the merger or consolidation continues to directly or indirectly own an interest in the QOF, and the distributee is distributed an interest in the resulting partnership as part of the merger or consolidation. See paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section for special rules relating to mixed-funds investments.
