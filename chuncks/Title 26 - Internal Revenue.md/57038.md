###### ยง 1.6050H-1 Information reporting of mortgage interest received in a trade or business from an individual.
####### Amount of interest received on mortgage for calendar year,In general.

(e)-(1)For purposes of this section and ยง 1.6050H-2, interest includes mortgage prepayment penalties and late charges other than late charges for a specific mortgage service. Interest also includes prepaid interest in the form of points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). Whether an interest recipient receives $600 or more of interest on a mortgage for a calendar year is determined on a mortgage-by-mortgage basis. An interest recipient need not aggregate interest received on all of the mortgages of a payor of record held by the interest recipient to determine whether the $600 threshold is met. Therefore, an interest recipient need not report interest of less than $600 received on a mortgage, even though it receives a total of $600 or more of interest on all of the mortgages of the payor of record for a calendar year.
