####### Period is the life of one individual.

(5)If the period described in ยง 1.664-3(a)(5) is the life of one individual, the factor that is used in determining the present value of the remainder interest for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, and before May 1, 1999, is the factor in Table U(1) in paragraph (e)(6) of this section under the appropriate adjusted payout. For purposes of the computations described in this paragraph (e)(5), the age of an individual is the age of that individual at the individual's nearest birthday. If the adjusted payout rate is an amount that is between adjusted payout rates for which factors are provided in the appropriate table, a linear interpolation must be made. The rules provided in ยง 1.664-4(e)(5) apply for determining the present value of the remainder interest. See ยง 1.664-4(e)(5) for an example illustrating the application of this paragraph (e)(5)(using current actuarial tables).
