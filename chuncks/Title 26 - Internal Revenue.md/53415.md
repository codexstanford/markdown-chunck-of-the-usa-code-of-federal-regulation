###### ยง 1.1502-59A Application of section 59A to consolidated groups.
####### Consolidated group as the applicable taxpayer,In general.

(b)-(1)For purposes of determining whether the consolidated group is an applicable taxpayer (within the meaning of ยง 1.59A-2(b)) and the amount of tax due pursuant to section 59A(a), all members of a consolidated group are treated as a single taxpayer. Thus, for example, members' deductions are aggregated in making the required computations under section 59A. In addition, to ensure that intercompany transactions (as defined in ยง 1.1502-13(b)(1)(i)) do not affect the consolidated group's base erosion percentage or base erosion minimum tax amount, items resulting from intercompany transactions are not taken into account in making such computations under section 59A. For example, additional depreciation deductions resulting from intercompany asset sales are not taken into account for purposes of applying the base erosion percentage test under ยง 1.59A-2(e).
