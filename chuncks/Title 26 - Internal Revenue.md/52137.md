###### ยง 1.1502-13 Intercompany transactions.
####### 9,Intercompany sale followed by section 351 transfer to nonmember.,Example 1,1

()The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A)() of this section, except that, instead of selling the land to X, B transfers the land to X in a transaction to which section 351(a) applies and X remains a nonmember. There is no difference in Year 3 between B's $0 corresponding item taken into account and the $0 recomputed corresponding item. Thus, none of S's intercompany gain is taken into account under the matching rule as a result of the section 351(a) transfer. However, S's entire gain is taken into account in Year 3 under the acceleration rule of paragraph (d) of this section (because X, a nonmember, reflects B's $100 cost basis in the land under section 362).
