####### Jurisdiction.

(ii)The designated local agency is the agency that has, pursuant to its charter, jurisdiction over the individual that is sought to be certified. Thus, any certification that is issued with respect to an individual who is not within the jurisdiction of the designated local agency that issued the certification will be invalid. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a request in writing for certification to the appropriate designated local agency that is made before January 23, 1984, will be considered to be timely if it is made after an otherwise timely request in writing for certification was made to a designated local agency that does not have jurisdiction over the individual sought to be certified.
