####### Monthly depositor.

(2)An agricultural employer is a monthly depositor of Form 943 taxes for a calendar year if the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) is $50,000 or less. An agricultural employer ceases to be a monthly depositor of Form 943 taxes on the first day after the employer is subject to the One-Day rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. At that time, the agricultural employer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of Form 943 taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the succeeding calendar year.
