(4)A covered debt instrument is not treated as stock under this section if, immediately after the covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the aggregate adjusted issue price of covered debt instruments held by members of the issuer's expanded group that would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4) does not exceed $50 million. To the extent a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership would be treated as a specified portion (as defined in paragraph (g)(23) of this section) but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the debt instrument is treated as a covered debt instrument described in the preceding sentence for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4).
