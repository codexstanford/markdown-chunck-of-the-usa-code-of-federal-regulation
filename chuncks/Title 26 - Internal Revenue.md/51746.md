####### Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.

(ii)The IRS may determine in its discretion that a sponsoring entity may not have substantially complied with the requirements of a sponsoring entity with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. This determination is based on the information reporting forms referenced in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section filed with the IRS by the sponsoring entity for each calendar year with respect to any sponsored direct reporting NFFE (or the absence of such reporting), the certification made by the responsible officer described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (or the absence of such certification), or any other information related to the sponsoring entity's compliance with the requirements of a sponsoring entity with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. In such a case, the IRS may request from the responsible officer information necessary to verify the sponsoring entity's compliance with such requirements. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the circumstances surrounding the sponsoring entity's potential failure to comply with the requirements of a sponsoring entity.
