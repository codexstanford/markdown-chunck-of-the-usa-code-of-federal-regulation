####### Analysis.

(B)Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, U's contract with the customer has two performance obligations, and each performance obligation yields a corresponding item of gross income that is accounted for separately. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, U is required to allocate the $1,000 transaction price amount to each corresponding item of gross income in accordance with the transaction price amount allocated to each respective performance obligation for AFS purposes. Accordingly, U allocates the transaction price amount as follows: $950 to the TV sale item and $50 to the reward points item. If U reports any portion of the $50 payment allocated to the reward points as AFS revenue for 2022, or later, the payment is an advance payment, as defined in ยง 1.451-8(a)(1), and may be accounted for under the deferral method if U satisfies the criteria in ยง 1.451-8(c).
