####### Disposition and acquisition of both natural resource recapture property and other property.

(2)For purposes of this paragraph (d), if both natural resource recapture property and property that is not natural resource recapture property are acquired as the result of one disposition in which both natural resource recapture property and property that is not natural resource recapture property are disposed of-

(i) The total amount realized upon the disposition is allocated between the natural resource recapture property and the property that is not natural resource recapture property disposed of in proportion to their respective fair market values;

(ii) The amount realized upon the disposition of the natural resource recapture property is deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of the natural resource recapture property acquired as is not in excess of the amount realized from the natural resource recapture property disposed of, and the remaining portion (if any) of the amount realized upon the disposition of such property is deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of the property that is not natural resource recapture property acquired as is not in excess of the remaining portion; and

(iii) The amount realized upon the disposition of the property that is not natural resource recapture property is deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of all the property acquired which was not taken into account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. Except as provided in section 1060 and the regulations thereunder, if a buyer and seller have adverse interests as to such allocation of the amount realized, any arm's-length agreement between the buyer and seller is used to establish the allocation. In the absence of such an agreement, the allocation is made by taking into account the appropriate facts and circumstances.
