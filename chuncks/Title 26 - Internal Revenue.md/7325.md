(ii) A modification of the contract that accelerates the payment of compensation is a material modification unless the amount of compensation paid is discounted to reasonably reflect the time value of money. If the contract is modified to defer the payment of compensation, any compensation paid or to be paid that is in excess of the amount that was originally payable to the employee under the contract will not be treated as resulting in a material modification if the additional amount is based on applying to the amount originally payable either a reasonable rate of interest or the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment as defined in § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2)(i)(B) of this chapter (whether or not assets associated with the amount originally owed are actually invested therein) such that the amount payable by the employer at the later date will be based on the reasonable rate of interest or the actual rate of return on the predetermined actual investment (including any decrease, as well as any increase, in the value of the investment). For an arrangement under which the grandfathered amounts are subject to increase or decrease based on the performance of a predetermined actual investment, the addition or substitution of a predetermined actual investment or reasonable interest rate as an investment alternative for amounts deferred is not treated as a material modification. However, a modification of a contract to defer payment of a grandfathered amount that results in payment of additional amounts (such as additional earnings) does not necessarily mean that the additional amounts are grandfathered amounts; for rules concerning the determination of grandfathered amounts see paragraph (g) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if compensation attributable to an option to purchase stock (other than an incentive stock option described in section 422 or a stock option granted under an employee stock purchase plan described in section 423) or a stock appreciation right is grandfathered, an extension of the exercise period that is extended in compliance with § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(C)() will not be treated as a material modification and the amount of compensation paid upon the exercise of the stock option or stock appreciation right will be grandfathered.

(iii) The adoption of a supplemental contract or agreement that provides for increased compensation, or the payment of additional compensation, is a material modification of a written binding contract if the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the additional compensation to be paid is based on substantially the same elements or conditions as the compensation that is otherwise paid pursuant to the written binding contract. However, a material modification of a written binding contract does not include a supplemental payment that is equal to or less than a reasonable cost-of-living increase over the payment made in the preceding year under that written binding contract. In addition, the failure, in whole or in part, to exercise negative discretion under a contract does not result in the material modification of that contract (although the existence of the negative discretion under the contract may impact the initial determination of whether amounts under the contract are grandfathered amounts).

(iv) If a grandfathered amount is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in § 1.409A-1(d)), then a modification of the contract that results in a lapse of the substantial risk of forfeiture is not considered a material modification. Furthermore, for compensation received pursuant to the substantial vesting of restricted property, or the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation right that does not provide for a deferral of compensation (as defined in § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i) and (ii)), a modification of a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, that results in a lapse of the substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined § 1.83-3(c)) is not considered a material modification.
