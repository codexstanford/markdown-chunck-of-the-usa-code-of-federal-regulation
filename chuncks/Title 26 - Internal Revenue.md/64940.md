###### ยง 31.3406(d)-1 Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number.
####### Brokerage account,Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to a brokerage relationship that is not a post-1983 brokerage account,In general.

(c)-(1)-(i)With respect to any instrument, investment, or deposit made through a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account, a payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the broker either orally or in writing. The payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct. See paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for the rule that any instrument, whenever acquired, that is held in a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account, is considered held in an account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account. For example, in 1983 a payee established and acquired a readily tradable instrument from a brokerage account; no activity took place through that account until the payee purchased a readily tradable instrument in 1995. That readily tradable instrument is not held in a post-1983 brokerage account; therefore, the payee need not certify under penalties of perjury that the payee's taxpayer identification number is correct.
