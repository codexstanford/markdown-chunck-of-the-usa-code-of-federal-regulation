###### Computation period.

(ii)Whether earnings are amounts described in subdivision (i) (A) or (B) of this subparagraph shall be determined by making computations on an annual basis. For example, if at the end of the first year the earnings on nonmortgage investments exceed the amount that could have been earned if such investments were invested at the bond yield, the amount of earnings equal to such difference constitutes an excess described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. In the following year, investment proceeds earned on such excess must be taken into account, whether or not such earnings exceed the yield on the bonds, and may not be treated as "negative arbitrage".
