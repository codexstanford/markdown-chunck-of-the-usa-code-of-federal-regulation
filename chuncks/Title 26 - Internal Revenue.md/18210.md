###### ยง 1.381(c)(1)-1 Net operating loss carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
####### Computation of carryovers and carrybacks; general rule,Sequence for applying losses and computation of taxable income.

(e)-(1)The portion of any net operating loss which is carried back or carried over to any taxable year is the excess, if any, of the amount of the loss over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior taxable years to which the loss may be carried under sections 172(b)(1) and 381. In determining the taxable income for each such prior taxable year for this purpose, the various net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to such prior taxable year are considered to be applied in reduction of the taxable income in the order of the taxable years in which the net operating losses are sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest taxable year. The application of this rule to the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer involves the use of carryovers of the distributor or transfer corporation, and of carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation. In such instance, the sequence for the use of loss years remains the same, and the requirement is to begin with the net operating loss of the earliest taxable year, whether or not it is a loss of the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation. The taxable income of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined in the manner prescribed by section 172(b)(2), except that, if the date of distribution or transfer is on a day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the taxable income of such corporation for the taxable year which includes such date shall be computed in the special manner prescribed by section 381(c)(1)(C) and paragraph (f) of this section.
