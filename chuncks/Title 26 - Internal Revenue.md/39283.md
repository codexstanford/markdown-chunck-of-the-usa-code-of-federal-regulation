####### A-5:

An electing ETC will recognize no income, gain, or loss on a transfer of its assets to a FSC but only if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) The assets transferred were held by the ETC on August 4, 1983, and were transferred by the ETC to the FSC in a transfer completed before January 1, 1986; and

(ii) The assets are transferred in a transaction which would qualify for nonrecognition under subchapter C of chapter 1 of the Code, or would so qualify but for section 367 of the Code.

In such case, section 367 shall not apply to the transfer. In addition, other provisions of subchapter C will apply to the transfer such as section 358 (basis to shareholders), section 362 (basis to corporation) and section 381 (carryovers in corporate acquisitions). In determining whether a transfer by an ETC to a FSC qualifies for nonrecognition under subchapter C, a liquidation of the assets of the ETC into a parent corporation followed by a transfer by the parent of those assets to the FSC will be treated as a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(D).
