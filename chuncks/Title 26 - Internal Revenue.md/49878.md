####### Reliance on claim of exemption by foreign government.

(b)Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, the withholding agent may rely upon a claim of exemption made by the foreign government if, prior to the payment, the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with documentation upon which it can rely to treat the payment as made to a beneficial owner in accordance with ยง 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii).
