()The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(A)() of this section, except that, rather than sell Asset X to an unrelated third party in 2024, A merges with and into an unrelated third party in 2024 in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A) in which no gain is recognized. As provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A)() of this section, the merger transaction is not treated as a "sale or other disposition" for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section. Thus, no adjustment to tentative taxable income is required in 2024 under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section.
