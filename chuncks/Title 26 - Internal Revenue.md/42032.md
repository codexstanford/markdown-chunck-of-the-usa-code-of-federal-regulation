()Except in the case of transfers to trusts, if the triggering event is the death of the eligible section 965(i) transferor, and the identity of the beneficiary or beneficiaries (in the case of multiple partial transfers) is determined as of the due date for the transfer agreement described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)()() of this section, then the transfer may be treated as a transfer directly between the eligible 965(i) transferor and the beneficiary or beneficiaries. If, however, the identity of the beneficiary or beneficiaries is not determined as of the due date for the transfer agreement described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)()() of this section, then the transfer must be treated first as a transfer between the eligible section 965(i) transferor and his or her estate at the time of death and second as a transfer between the estate and the beneficiary or beneficiaries when the shares are actually transferred to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Separate transfer agreements must be filed for each transfer. The transfer from the eligible section 965(i) transferor to his or her estate is a transfer resulting from a triggering event that is the death of the eligible section 965(i) transferor, and the transfer agreement is subject to the timing rules in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)()() of this section. The transfer from the estate to the beneficiary or beneficiaries is not a transfer resulting from a triggering event that is the death of the eligible section 965(i) transferor, and the transfer agreement is subject to the timing rules in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)()() and () of this section.
