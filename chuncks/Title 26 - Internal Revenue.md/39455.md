####### Transition rules

(5)-(i) In the case of an election filed prior to April 11, 2005, except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section will apply as of the first day of the first taxable year of the entity beginning after April 11, 2005.

(ii) In the unlikely circumstance that inconsistent elections described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section are filed prior to April 11, 2005, and the entity cannot change its classification to achieve consistency because of the sixty-month limitation described in ยง 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv) of this chapter, then the entity may nevertheless request permission from the Commissioner or appropriate tax authority of the relevant possession to change such election to avoid inconsistent treatment by the Commissioner and the appropriate tax authority of the relevant possession.

(iv) In the case of an entity created or organized prior to April 11, 2005, paragraph (e)(4) of this section will take effect for Federal income tax purposes (or the relevant possession income tax purposes, as the case may be) as of the first day of the first taxable year of the entity beginning after April 11, 2005.
