####### Disqualification treated as distribution.,see

(3)If all or any portion of a nuclear decommissioning fund is disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the portion of the nuclear decommissioning fund that is disqualified is treated as distributed to the electing taxpayer on the date of disqualification. Such a distribution shall be treated for purposes of section 1001 as a disposition of property held by the nuclear decommissioning fund (ยง 1.468A-4(c)(2)). In addition, the electing taxpayer must include in gross income for the taxable year that includes the date of disqualification an amount equal to the fair market value of the distributable assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund multiplied by the fraction of the nuclear decommissioning fund that was disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For this purpose, the fair market value of the distributable assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund is equal to the fair market value of the assets of the fund determined as of the date of disqualification, reduced by-

(i) The amount of any excess contribution that was not withdrawn before the date of disqualification if no deduction was allowed with respect to such excess contribution;

(ii) The amount of any deemed distribution that was not actually distributed before the date of disqualification (as determined under ยง 1.468A-2(d)(2)(iii)) if the amount of the deemed distribution was included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the deemed distribution occurred; and

(iii) The amount of any tax that-

(A) Is imposed on the income of the fund;

(B) Is attributable to income taken into account before the date of disqualification or as a result of the disqualification; and

(C) Has not been paid as of the date of disqualification.
