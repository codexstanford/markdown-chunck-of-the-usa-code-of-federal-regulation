####### Requirement of return with respect to stock purchased under an employee stock purchase plan under section 6039(a)(2).

(b)(1) Every corporation which in any calendar year records, or has by its agent recorded, a transfer of the legal title of a share of stock acquired by the transferor (person who acquires the shares pursuant to the exercise of the option) pursuant to the transferor's exercise of an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan as described in section 423(c) and where the exercise price is less than 100 percent of the value of the stock on date of grant or is not fixed or determinable on the date of the grant, shall, for such calendar year, file a return with respect to each transfer made during such year. This return must include the following information-

(i) The name, address, and identifying number of the transferor;

(ii) The name, address and employer identification number of the corporation whose stock is being transferred;

(iii) The date the option was granted to the transferor;

(iv) The fair market value of the stock on the date the option was granted;

(v) The actual exercise price paid per share;

(vi) The exercise price per share determined as if the option were exercised on the date the option was granted to the transferor (to be provided only if the exercise price per share is not fixed or determinable on the date the option was granted);

(vii) The date the option was exercised by the transferor;

(viii) The fair market value of the stock on the date the option was exercised by the transferor;

(ix) The date the legal title of the shares was transferred by the transferor (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); and

(x) The number of shares to which legal title was transferred by the transferor.

(2) Each return required by this paragraph (b) shall be made on Form 3922, Transfer of Stock Acquired Through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under Section 423(c) (or its designated successor) and shall be filed in such manner as provided in the instructions thereto.

(3) A return is required by reason of a transfer described in section 6039(a)(2) only with respect to the first transfer of legal title of the shares by the transferor, including the first transfer of legal title to a recognized broker or financial institution. If a contractual agreement exists or is entered into with a recognized broker or financial institution pursuant to which shares acquired upon exercise of the option will be immediately deposited into a brokerage account established on behalf of the transferor, then the deposit of shares by the transferor into the brokerage account following the exercise of the option is the first transfer of legal title of the shares acquired by the transferor, and the corporation is only required to file a return relating to such transfer of legal title.

(4) Every corporation that transfers any share of stock pursuant to the exercise of an option described in this paragraph shall identify such stock in a manner sufficient to enable the accurate reporting of the transfer of legal title to such shares. Such identification may be accomplished by assigning to the certificates of stock issued pursuant to the exercise of such options a special serial number or color.
