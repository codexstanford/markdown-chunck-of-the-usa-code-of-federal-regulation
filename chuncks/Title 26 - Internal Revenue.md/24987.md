(i)-(A)A, a video arcade operator, receives payments in 2021 for tokens that customers use to play A's arcade games. The tokens cannot be redeemed for cash, are imprinted with the name of the arcade, but are not individually marked for identification. A completed a study on a statistical basis, based on adequate data available to A, and concluded that for payments received in 2021, 70% of tokens are expected to be used in 2021, 20% of tokens are expected to be used in 2022, and 10% of tokens are expected to never be used. Based on the study, under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, A determines that 80% of the advance payments are earned for 2021 (70% for tokens expected to be used in 2021 plus 10% for tokens that are expected to never be used).
