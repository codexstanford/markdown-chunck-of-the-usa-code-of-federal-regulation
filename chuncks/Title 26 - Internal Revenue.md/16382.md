###### ยง 1.338-4 Aggregate deemed sale price; various aspects of taxation of the deemed asset sale.
####### Deemed sale tax consequences.

(e)Gain or loss on each asset in the deemed sale is computed by reference to the ADSP allocated to that asset. ADSP is allocated under the rules of ยง 1.338-6. Though deemed sale tax consequences may increase or decrease ADSP by creating or reducing a tax liability, the amount of the tax liability itself may be a function of the size of the deemed sale tax consequences. Thus, these determinations may require trial and error computations.
