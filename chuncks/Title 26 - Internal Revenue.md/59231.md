####### Manner of allocating adjustment.

(4)Pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of the Act, the amount of the adjustment required under this paragraph for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, which is attributable to a particular kind or class of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made with respect to that kind or class of such property. If the adjustment required under this paragraph for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, is attributable to retirement-straight property of a particular kind or class no longer held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date, then the part of the adjustment to be allocated to any retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the adjustment as the unadjusted basis of the property so held bears to the entire unadjusted basis of all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date.
