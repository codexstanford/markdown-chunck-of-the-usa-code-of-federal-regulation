####### Election for special treatment,In general.

(a)-(1)An individual citizen of the United States who meets the requirements of section 981(a)(1) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for any open taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, and before January 1, 1977, may make a binding election with his nonresident alien spouse to have section 981(b) and paragraph (b) of this section apply to their income for such year which is treated as community income under the applicable community property laws of a foreign country or countries. Generally, the community property laws of a foreign country operate upon land situated within its jurisdiction and upon personal property owned by spouses domiciled therein. If the election is made for any taxable year, it shall also apply for all subsequent open taxable years of such citizen and his nonresident alien spouse for which all the requirements of section 981(a)(1) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are met, unless the Director of International Operations consents, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to a termination of the election. An election under section 981(a) and this section has no effect for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1967, for which a separate election, if made, must be made under section 981(c)(1) and § 1.981-2. For the definition of "open taxable year" see section 981(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of § 1.981-3. If the citizen and his nonresident alien spouse have different taxable years, see paragraph (c) of § 1.981-3. If one of the spouses is deceased, see paragraph (d) of § 1.981-3.
