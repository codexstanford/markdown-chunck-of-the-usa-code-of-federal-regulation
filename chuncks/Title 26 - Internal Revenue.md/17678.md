() The condition of paragraph (k)(14)(iii) of this section is satisfied if DC enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer. Under paragraph (k)(14)(iii)(B) of this section, DC is not required to describe any subsequent dispositions or other events that (based on the principles of paragraph (j) of this section) would constitute triggering events for purposes of the new gain recognition agreement, other than the dispositions or other events described in paragraph (j) of this section, because DC holds a direct interest in TFD after the asset reorganization.
