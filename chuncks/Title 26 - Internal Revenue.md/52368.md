####### Election to treat investment of one member as a qualifying investment by another member,Availability of election.

(2)-(i)If members of a consolidated group satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2), the consolidated group may elect to treat an investment by one member as a qualifying investment by another member. The election provided by this paragraph (c)(2) is available when a member of a consolidated group (M1) has eligible gain and a second member (M2) makes an investment in a QOF that would be a qualifying investment if M1, rather than M2, had made the investment. For example, if M1 has $100x of eligible gain but M2 has none, and M2 makes a $120x investment in a QOF C corporation, only $100x of M2's investment in the QOF C corporation is eligible for the election under this paragraph (c)(2). See paragraph (h)(2) of this section for the form and manner of making this election. If M2 has its own eligible gain, M2 may make a qualifying investment on its own behalf and defer such eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) and ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1.
