####### Overview for FDE.,1,ii

(B)FDE accrues and records on its books and records $100,000x of gross income from sales of gasoline engines to unrelated persons. FDE's gross income is non-passive category income and is foreign source income. In Year 1, the foreign gross receipts of FDE from sales of gasoline engines total $300,000x. The disregarded royalty payment from FDE to X is not recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph ยง 1.904-4(f)(2)(i) because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the $10,000x disregarded royalty payment would be allocable to foreign source gross income attributable to FDE under ยง 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(B)()(). Therefore, under ยง 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(A) the amount of foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downwards and the amount of foreign source gross income attributable to X is adjusted upward to take the $10,000x disregarded royalty payment into account.
