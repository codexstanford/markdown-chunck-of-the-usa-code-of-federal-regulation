####### Absorption of ineligible NOL.

(vii)(A) If all or a portion of a nonlife member's ineligible NOL (determined under paragraph (h)(3)(vi)(A) of this section) may be carried back or carried over under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to a particular consolidated return year of the nonlife subgroup (absorption year), then notwithstanding ยง 1.1502-21(b), the amount carried to the absorption year will be absorbed by that member's contribution (to the extent thereof) to nonlife consolidated taxable income for that year, subject to the limitation in section 172(a).

(B) For purposes of paragraph (h)(3)(vii)(A) of this section, a member's contribution to nonlife consolidated taxable income for an absorption year is the amount of such income (computed without the portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction attributable to taxable years subsequent to the year the loss arose), minus such consolidated taxable income recomputed by excluding both that member's items of income and deductions for the absorption year. The deductions of the member include the prior application of this paragraph (h)(3)(vii) to the absorption of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction for losses arising in taxable years prior to the particular loss year.
