() Because T's oldest (2017) carryover was sustained in a year beginning before January 1, 2018, its use is not subject to limitation under section 172(a)(2)(B). Therefore, all $10 of T's 2017 SRLY net operating loss (that is, a pre-2018 NOL) is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for 2022. After deduction of T's $10 SRLY net operating loss from 2017, the cumulative register of T is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $10, and $60 remains in the cumulative register ($70-$10).
