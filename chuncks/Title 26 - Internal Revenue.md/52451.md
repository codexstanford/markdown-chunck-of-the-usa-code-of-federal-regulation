####### Example 7: Computation and application of the attribute reduction amount under § 1.1502-36(d) when S owns a QOF,Facts.

(7)-(i)In 2018, S sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $5,000x of eligible gain. S contributes $5,000x to Q in exchange for stock of Q and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. In 2024, M sells all of its S stock to X for its fair market value of $100x, and M's basis in the stock of S is $300x. At the time of sale, S owns the Q stock with a basis of $500x (S's basis in its Q stock was increased under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) to $500x in 2023), and S has a net operating loss carryover of $50x. M's transfer of the S shares is a transfer of loss shares under § 1.1502-36. Assume that no basis redetermination is required under § 1.1502-36(b) and no basis reduction is required under § 1.1502-36(c).
