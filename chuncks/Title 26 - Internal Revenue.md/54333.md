(ii)The $100x of interest expense attributable to P's interest in DE1constitutes a dual consolidated loss. However, because the sole item constituting the dual consolidated loss cannot be deducted or capitalized (at any time) for Country X tax purposes, P can demonstrate that there can be no foreign use of the dual consolidated loss at any time. As a result, pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-6(c)(1), if P prepares a statement described in ยง 1.1503(d)-6(c)(2) and attaches it to its timely filed tax return, the year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to P's interest in DE1will not be subject to the domestic use limitation rule of ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b).
