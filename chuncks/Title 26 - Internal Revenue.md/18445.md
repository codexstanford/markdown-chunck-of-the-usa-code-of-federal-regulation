###### ยง 1.381(c)(18)-1 Depletion on extraction of ores or minerals from the waste or residue of prior mining.
####### Application of section 614 to waste or residue of prior mining.

(b)If, in a transaction described in section 381(a), the acquiring corporation acquires waste or residue of prior mining from a distributor or transferor corporation, then the acquiring corporation shall be considered as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of applying section 614 and the regulations thereunder to the waste or residue so acquired. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation was required under paragraph (c) of ยง 1.614-1 to treat the waste or residue as part of the mineral deposit from which it was extracted and if the acquiring corporation acquires both the waste or residue and the mineral deposit from which it was extracted in a transaction described in section 381(a), then such waste or residue shall be treated as a part of such mineral deposit in the hands of the acquiring corporation. On the other hand, if the waste or residue was required to be treated as a separate mineral deposit in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation, such waste or residue shall be treated as a separate mineral deposit in the hands of the acquiring corporation.
