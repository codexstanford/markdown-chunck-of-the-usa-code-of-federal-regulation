### Subchapter A - Income Tax

##### Special Taxes and Taxpayers
###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Application of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule.

(B)New T was a member of the Parent group when New T acquired Equipment #6 from an unrelated person. Because Old T, another member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #6 while a member of the group within the lookback period, New T would be treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #6 under the Group Prior Use Rule and New T's acquisition of Equipment #6 would not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. However, New T's acquisition of Equipment #6 satisfies the requirements of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. First, New T's acquisition of Equipment #6 meets the requirements of ยง 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A) without regard to the Group Prior Use Rule. Second, as part of the same series of related transactions that includes B's qualified stock purchase of the T stock, B and New T cease to be members of the Parent group and cease to be Related to S. Third, Equipment #6 continues to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date (June 1, 2019).
