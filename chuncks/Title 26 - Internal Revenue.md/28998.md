####### Coordination of pre-2018 and post-2017 NOLs.

(2)An organization with pre-2018 NOLs, and with losses arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 NOLs), deducts its pre-2018 NOLs from total UBTI before deducting any post-2017 NOLs with regard to a separate unrelated trade or business against the UBTI from such trade or business. Pre-2018 NOLs are taken against the total UBTI as determined under paragraph (g) of this section in a manner that allows for maximum utilization of post-2017 NOLs in a taxable year. For example, an organization could choose to allocate all of its pre-2018 NOLs to one of its separate unrelated trades or businesses or it could allocate its pre-2018 NOLs ratably among its separate unrelated trades or businesses, whichever results in the greatest utilization of the post-2017 NOLs in that taxable year.
