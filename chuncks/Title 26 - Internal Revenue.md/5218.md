###### ยง 1.132-4 Line of business limitation.
####### Property and services sold to employees rather than customers.

(ii)Because the property or services must be offered for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the same line of business in which the employee performs substantial services, the line of business limitation is not satisfied if the employer's products or services are sold primarily to employees of the employer, rather than to customers. Thus, for example, an employer in the banking line of business is not considered in the variety store line of business if the employer establishes an employee store that offers variety store items for sale to the employer's employees. See ยง 1.132-7 for rules relating to employer-operated eating facilities, and see ยง 1.132-1(e) for rules relating to employer-operated on-premises athletic facilities.
