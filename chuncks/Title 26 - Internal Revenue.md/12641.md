####### Estimate of exploration expenditures.

(iv)If, on the date a corporation (which is a member of an affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year) files its income tax return for such taxable year, it cannot be determined whether or not the $100,000 limitation prescribed by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, or the $400,000 limitation prescribed by subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, will apply with respect to such taxable year, then such member shall, for purposes of such return, apply the provisions of such subdivisions (i) and (ii) with respect to such taxable year on the basis of an estimate of the aggregate of the exploration expenditures by all such members of the affiliated group for their matching taxable years. Such estimate shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances known at the time of such estimate. If an estimate is used by any such member of the affiliated group pursuant to this subdivision, and if the actual expenditures by all such members differ from the estimate, then each such member shall file as soon as possible an original or amended return reflecting an amended apportionment (either pursuant to an apportionment plan adopted under paragraph (f) of this section or pursuant to the application of the rule provided by subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph) based upon such actual expenditures.
