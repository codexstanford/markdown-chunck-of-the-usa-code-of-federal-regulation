###### ยง 1.430(f)-1 Effect of prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance.
####### Requirement to reduce funding standard carryover balance before prefunding balance.

(2)To the extent that a plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is permitted to be made that reduces the plan's prefunding balance. Thus, a plan must exhaust its funding standard carryover balance before it is permitted to make an election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section with respect to its prefunding balance.
