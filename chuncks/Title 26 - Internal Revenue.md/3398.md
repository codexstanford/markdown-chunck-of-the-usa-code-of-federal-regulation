####### Extent of taxability.

(b)(1) Amounts allocated to a patron on a patronage basis by a cooperative association with respect to products marketed for such patron, or with respect to supplies, equipment, or services, the cost of which was deductible by the patron under section 162 or section 212, shall be included in the computation of the gross income of such patron, as ordinary income, to the following extent:

(i) If the allocation is in cash, the amount of cash received.

(ii) If the allocation is in merchandise, the amount of the fair market value of such merchandise at the time of receipt by the patron.

(iii) If the allocation is in the form of revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice, or similar documents, the amount of the fair market value of such document at the time of its receipt by the patron. For purposes of this subdivision, any document containing an unconditional promise to pay a fixed sum of money on demand or at a fixed or determinable time shall be considered to have a fair market value at the time of its receipt by the patron, unless it is clearly established to the contrary. However, for purposes of this subdivision, any document which is payable only in the discretion of the cooperative association, or which is otherwise subject to conditions beyond the control of the patron, shall be considered not to have any fair market value at the time of its receipt by the patron, unless it is clearly established to the contrary.

(iv) If the allocation is in the form of capital stock, the amount of the fair market value, if any, of such capital stock at the time of its receipt by the patron.

(2) If any allocation to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies is received in the form of a document of the type described in subparagraph (1) (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph and is redeemed in full or in part or is otherwise disposed of, there shall be included in the computation of the gross income of the patron, as ordinary income, in the year of redemption or other disposition, the excess of the amount realized on the redemption or other disposition over the amount previously included in the computation of gross income under such subparagraph.

(3)(i) Amounts which are allocated on a patronage basis by a cooperative association with respect to supplies, equipment, or services, the cost of which was not deductible by the patron under section 162 or section 212, are not includible in the computation of the gross income of such patron. However, in the case of such amounts which are allocated with respect to capital assets (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the trade or business within the meaning of section 1231, such amounts shall, to the extent set forth in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, be taken into account by such patron in determining the cost of the property to which the allocation relates. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent that such amounts are in excess of the unrecovered cost of such property, and to the extent that such amounts relate to such property which the patron no longer owns, they shall be included in the computation of the gross income of such patron.

(ii) If any patronage dividend is allocated to the patron in the form of a document of the type described in subparagraph (1) (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph, and if such allocation is with respect to capital assets (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the trade or business within the meaning of section 1231, any amount realized on the redemption or other disposition of such document which is in excess of the amount which was taken into account upon the receipt of the document by the patron shall be taken into account by such patron in the year of redemption or other disposition as an adjustment to basis or as an inclusion in the computation of gross income, as the case may be.

(iii) Any adjustment to basis in respect of an amount to which subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph applies shall be made as of the first day of the taxable year in which such amount is received.

(iv) The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
