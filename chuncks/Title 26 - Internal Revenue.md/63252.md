## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter B - Estate and Gift Taxes
#### PART 25 - GIFT TAX; GIFTS MADE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1954
##### Special Valuation Rules
###### ยง 25.2702-1 Special valuation rules in the case of transfers of interests in trust.
####### Effect of section 2702.

(b)If section 2702 applies to a transfer, the value of any interest in the trust retained by the transferor or any applicable family member is determined under ยง 25.2702-2(b). The amount of the gift, if any, is then determined by subtracting the value of the interests retained by the transferor or any applicable family member from the value of the transferred property. If the retained interest is not a qualified interest (as defined in ยง 25.2702-3), the retained interest is generally valued at zero, and the amount of the gift is the entire value of the property.
