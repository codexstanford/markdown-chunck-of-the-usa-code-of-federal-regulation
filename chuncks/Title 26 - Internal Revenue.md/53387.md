####### Consolidated tested loss.

(B)Under paragraph (e)(7) of this section, the P consolidated group's consolidated tested loss is $300x ($100x + $200x), the sum of USS1's aggregate tested loss, which is equal to its pro rata share (determined under ยง 1.951A-1(d)(4)) of CFC1's tested loss ($100x), and USS2's aggregate tested loss, which is equal to its pro rata share (determined under ยง 1.951A-1(d)(4)) of CFC3's tested loss ($200x). Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, a member's allocable share of the consolidated tested loss is the product of the consolidated tested loss of the member's consolidated group and the member's GILTI allocation ratio. Therefore, the allocable shares of the consolidated tested loss of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 (0 x $300x), $75x (0.25 x $300x), and $225x (0.75 x $300x), respectively.
