####### Options issued or transferred before January 1, 1987,Options issued before May 6, 1986.

(8)-(i)An option issued before May 6, 1986, is subject to the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section only if it is transferred by (or to) a 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised) on or after such date. In all other cases, such an option shall not be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, but shall be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(xii) of this section. Thus, for example, a warrant to acquire stock of the loss corporation issued before May 6, 1986 shall not be subject to paragraph (h)(4) of this section unless the warrant is transferred by (or to) a 5-percent shareholder. The exercise of such a warrant, however, would be taken into account as required by this paragraph (m)(8)(i) and paragraph (h)(4)(xii) of this section.
