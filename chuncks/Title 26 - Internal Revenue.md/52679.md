###### ยง 1.1502-21 Net operating losses.
####### Subgroup rules.

(4)In general, in the case of a net operating loss carryover for which there is a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup (as defined in ยง 1.1502-91(d)(1)), the principles of this paragraph (g) apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies-

(i) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section only if-

(A) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover are also included in a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover; and

(B) All members of a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover; and

(ii) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section only if all members of the SRLY subgroup for that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup that has net operating loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that are subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
