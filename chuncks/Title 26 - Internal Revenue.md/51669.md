###### ยง 1.1471-6 Payments beneficially owned by exempt beneficial owners.
####### Exception for commercial activities,General rule.

(h)-(1)An exempt beneficial owner described in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section will not be treated as an exempt beneficial owner with respect to a payment that is derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity of a type engaged in by an insurance company, custodial institution, or depository institution (including the accepting of deposits). Thus, for example, a central bank of issue that conducts a commercial financial activity, such as acting as an intermediary on behalf of persons other than in the bank's capacity as a central bank of issue, is not an exempt beneficial owner under paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to payments received in connection with an account held in connection with such activity.
