####### Analysis,1,DC1.

(B)-()Because DC1 owns an interest in PRS during DC1's taxable year and receives a distributive share of partnership items of the partnership under section 706(d), DC1 has partnership QBAI with respect to PRS in the amount determined under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, DC1's partner adjusted basis in Asset G is $25x, the product of $100x (the partnership's adjusted basis in the property) and 25 percent (DC1's section 704(b) distributive share of depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G). Therefore, DC1's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $25x. Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC1 increases its QBAI by $25x for Year 1.
