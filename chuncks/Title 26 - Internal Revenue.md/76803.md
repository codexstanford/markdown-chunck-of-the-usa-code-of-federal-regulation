####### ยง 301.9100-19T Election relating to passive investment income of electing small business corporations.
######## New shareholders.

(c)Section 1372(e)(1) of the Code provides that an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall terminate if certain new shareholders do not consent to such election within the time prescribed by regulations. New shareholders of a corporation which makes an election under paragraph (b) of this section may not have consented to the corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code within such prescribed time as a result of a termination of such election under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 89-389. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not be treated as terminated for the failure of any new shareholder to file a timely consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, for any of the taxable years of the corporation between and including the earliest taxable year determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and the taxable year during which the corporation files an election under paragraph (b) of this section, if-

(1) The corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code would have terminated for a taxable year under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code in the event it had not made an election under paragraph (b) of this section, and

(2) A proper consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code is filed by such new shareholder with the corporation's election under paragraph (b) of this section.
