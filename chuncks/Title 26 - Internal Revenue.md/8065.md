####### Tentative taxable income of RICs and REITs.

(ii)The tentative taxable income of a RIC or REIT for purposes of calculating ATI is the tentative taxable income of the corporation, without any adjustment that would be made under section 852(b)(2) or 857(b)(2) to compute investment company taxable income or real estate investment trust taxable income, respectively. For example, the tentative taxable income of a RIC or REIT is not reduced by the deduction for dividends paid, but is reduced by the dividends received deduction (DRD) and the other deductions described in sections 852(b)(2)(C) and 857(b)(2)(A). See paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section for an adjustment to ATI in respect of these items.
