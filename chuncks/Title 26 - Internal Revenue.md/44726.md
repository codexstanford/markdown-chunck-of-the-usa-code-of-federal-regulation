###### ยง 1.1082-3 Reduction of basis of property by reason of gain not recognized under section 1081(b).
####### Introductory.

(a)In addition to the adjustments provided in section 1016 and other applicable provisions of chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations relating thereto, which are required to be made with respect to the cost or other basis of property, section 1082(a)(2) provides that a further adjustment shall be made in any case in which there shall have been a nonrecognition of gain under section 1081(b). Such further adjustment shall be made with respect to the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor immediately after the transfer and of the property acquired within 24 months after such transfer by an expenditure or investment to which section 1081(b) relates, and on account of which expenditure or investment gain is not recognized. If the property is in the hands of the transferor immediately after the transfer, the time of reduction is the day of the transfer; in all other cases the time of reduction is the date of acquisition. The effect of applying an amount in reduction of basis of property under section 1081 (b) is to reduce by such amount the basis for determining gain upon sale or other disposition, the basis for determining loss upon sale or other disposition, the basis for depreciation and for depletion, and any other amount which the Code prescribes shall be the same as any of such bases. For the purposes of the application of an amount in reduction of basis under section 1081(b), property is not considered as having a basis capable of reduction if-

(1) It is money, or

(2) If its adjusted basis for determining gain at the time the reduction is to be made is zero, or becomes zero at any time in the application of section 1081 (b).
