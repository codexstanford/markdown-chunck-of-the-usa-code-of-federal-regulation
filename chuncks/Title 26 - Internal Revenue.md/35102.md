###### § 1.861-14 Special rules for allocating and apportioning certain expenses (other than interest expense) of an affiliated group of corporations.
####### Section 250 deduction.

(4)Except as provided in this paragraph (e)(4), the deduction allowed under section 250(a) (the section 250 deduction) to a member of an affiliated group is allocated and apportioned on a separate entity basis under the rules of § 1.861-8(e)(13) and (14). However, the section 250 deduction of a member of a consolidated group is not directly allocable to specific income-producing activities or property solely of the member of the affiliated group that is allowed the deduction. See § 1.1502-50 for rules on applying section 250 and §§ 1.250-1 through 1.250(b)-6 to a member of a consolidated group. In such case, the section 250 deduction is allocated and apportioned as if all members of the consolidated group are treated as a single corporation.
