###### ยง 1.597-6 Limitation on collection of federal income tax.
####### Limitation on collection where federal income tax is borne by an Agency.

(a)If an Institution without Continuing Equity (or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries) is liable for federal income tax that is attributable to the inclusion in income of FFA or gain from a Taxable Transfer, the federal income tax will not be collected if it would be borne by an Agency. The final determination of whether the federal income tax would be borne by an Agency is within the sole discretion of the Commissioner. In determining whether federal income tax would be borne by an Agency, the Commissioner will disregard indemnity, tax-sharing, or similar obligations of an Agency, an Institution, or its Consolidated Subsidiaries. Collection of the several federal income tax liability under ยง 1.1502-6 from members of an Institution's consolidated group other than the Institution or its Consolidated Subsidiaries is not affected by this section. Federal income tax will continue to be subject to collection except as specifically limited in this section. This section does not apply to taxes other than federal income taxes.
