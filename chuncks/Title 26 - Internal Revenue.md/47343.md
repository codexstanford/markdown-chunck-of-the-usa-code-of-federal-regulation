(c)(1) A failure on the part of the taxpayer to have on hand in his closing inventory for the taxable year merchandise of the kind, description, and quantity of that reflected in his opening inventory will be considered as an involuntary liquidation only if it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such failure is due wholly to his inability to purchase, manufacture, or otherwise produce and procure delivery of such merchandise during the taxable year of liquidation by reason of the disruption of normal trade relations between countries or by reason of certain war conditions, described in section 22(d)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as modified by section 1321(b). Such war conditions are (i) shortages in the source of foreign supply by reason of capture or control by an enemy; (ii) shipping or other transportation shortages; (iii) material shortages resulting from priorities or allocations; (iv) labor shortages; and (v) similar war conditions beyond the control of the taxpayer. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the wordsandshall be interpreted to apply to circumstances, occurrences, and conditions lacking a state of war, which are similar, by reason of a state of national preparedness, to those which would exist under a state of war.
