###### ยง 1.1441-7 General provisions relating to withholding agents.
####### e.g.,

(iii) The withholding agent must review the documentary evidence provided by the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch to determine that there is no obvious indication that the payee is a U.S. non-exempt recipient or that the documentary evidence does not establish the identity of the person who provided the documentation (the documentary evidence does not appear to be an identification document).

(iv) If the beneficial owner is claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty, the rules of ยง 1.1441-6(b)(1)(ii) also apply to determine whether the withholding agent has reason to know that a claim for treaty benefits is unreliable or incorrect.
