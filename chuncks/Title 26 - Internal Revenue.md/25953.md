(3) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shall provide a schedule of ruling amounts that is identical to the schedule of ruling amounts proposed by the taxpayer in connection with the taxpayer's request for a schedule of ruling amounts (paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section), but no schedule of ruling amounts shall be provided unless the taxpayer's proposed schedule of ruling amounts is consistent with the principles and provisions of this section and is based on reasonable assumptions. If a proposed schedule of ruling amounts is not consistent with the principles and provisions of this section or is not based on reasonable assumptions, the taxpayer may propose an amended schedule of ruling amounts that is consistent with such principles and provisions and is based on reasonable assumptions.

(4) The taxpayer bears the burden of demonstrating that the proposed schedule of ruling amounts is consistent with the principles and provisions of this section and is based on reasonable assumptions. If a public utility commission established or approved the currently applicable rates for the furnishing or sale by the taxpayer of electricity from the plant, the taxpayer can generally satisfy this burden of proof by demonstrating that the schedule of ruling amounts is calculated using the assumptions used by the public utility commission in its most recent order. In addition, a taxpayer that owns an interest in a deregulated nuclear plant may submit assumptions used by a public utility commission that formerly had regulatory jurisdiction over the plant as support for the assumptions used in calculating the taxpayer's proposed schedule of ruling amounts, with the understanding that the assumptions used by the public utility commission may be given less weight if they are out of date or were developed in a proceeding for a different taxpayer. The use of other industry standards, such as the assumptions underlying the taxpayer's most recent financial assurance filing with the NRC, are an alternative means of demonstrating that the taxpayer has calculated its proposed schedule of ruling amounts on a reasonable basis. Consistency with financial accounting statements is not sufficient, in the absence of other supporting evidence, to meet the taxpayer's burden of proof under this paragraph (a)(4).
