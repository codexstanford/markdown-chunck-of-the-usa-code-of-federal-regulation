###### ยง 1.905-3 Adjustments to U.S. tax liability and to current earnings and profits as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
####### 2,Analysis.

()Under ยง 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(iii), because the u was an inflationary currency in the year the taxes were paid, USC must translate the 100u of Year 1 tax into dollars using the spot rate on the date of payment of the foreign taxes. Under paragraph (a) of this section, because the translated value of USC's Year 1 taxes when paid, that is, $50x (100u translated at the spot rate on April 15, Year 3, that is, $1x:2u), differs from the amount claimed as credits, that is, $100x (100u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u), a foreign tax redetermination has occurred. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, because the $50x foreign tax redetermination resulting from the currency fluctuation exceeds 2% of the $100x initially accrued, USC must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1, the taxable year to which the redetermined tax relates. Accordingly, USC must notify the IRS, reducing the amount of foreign tax credit claimed for Year 1 by $50x (the excess of the translated value of the Year 1 taxes when accrued, that is, $100x, over the translated value of the Year 1 taxes when paid, that is, $50x).
