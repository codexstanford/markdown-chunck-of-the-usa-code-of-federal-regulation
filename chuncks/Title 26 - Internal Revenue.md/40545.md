####### Priority of application.

(a)For purposes of determining the subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation under section 952 for any taxable year, the provisions of section 954, relating to foreign base company income, shall be applied, after first applying section 953, only with respect to income which is not income derived from the insurance of United States risks under section 953. For example, the provisions of section 954 may be applied with respect to the income of a controlled foreign corporation which is not income derived from the insurance of United States risks under section 953 because such corporation does not satisfy the 5-percent minimum premium requirement prescribed in paragraph (b) of ยง 1.953-1, even though such corporation has taxable income, as determined under ยง 1.953-4, which is attributable to the reinsuring or the issuing of any insurance or annuity contracts in connection with United States risks. In addition, the provisions of section 954 may apply with respect to the income of a controlled foreign corporation to the extent such income is not allocated or apportioned under ยง 1.953-4 to the insurance of United States risks.
