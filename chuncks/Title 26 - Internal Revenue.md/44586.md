####### Unrelated Non-Service Partner requirement.

(iv)For purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Unrelated Non-Service Partner requirement means that Unrelated Non-Service Partners must have made significant aggregate capital contributions in relation to total capital contributions of all partners. Unrelated Non-Service Partners will be treated as having made significant aggregate capital contributions provided such partners possess five percent or more of the aggregate capital contributed to the partnership at the time the allocations are made. With respect to an API Holder with allocation and distribution rights that are attributable to a particular interest class or partnership investment, the Unrelated Non-Service requirement must be met with respect to that particular interest class or partnership investment.
