###### ยง 1.1474-1 Liability for withheld tax and withholding agent reporting.
####### Special reporting requirements of participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, FFIs that make an election under section 1471(b)(3), and U.S. branches of FFIs not treated as U.S. persons.

(B)Except as otherwise provided in ยง 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F), a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT, and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in ยง 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) or an FFI that has made an election under section 1471(b)(3) and has provided sufficient information to its withholding agent to withhold and report the payment is not required to report the payment on Form 1042-S as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section if the payment is made to a nonparticipating FFI or recalcitrant account holder and its withholding agent has withheld the correct amount of tax on such payment and correctly reported the payment on a Form 1042-S. Such FFI or branch is required to report a payment, however, when the FFI knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld by the withholding agent on the payment or the withholding agent has not correctly reported the payment on Form 1042-S. In such case, the FFI or branch must report on Form 1042-S to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. See, however, ยง 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the requirement to report certain aggregate information regarding accounts held by recalcitrant account holders on Form 8966, "FATCA Report," regardless of whether withholdable payments are made to such accounts.
