####### Special rules.

(ii)(A) The amounts determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) (other than amounts described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(1)) of this section with respect to a subsidiary include its allocable share of corresponding amounts with respect to all lower-tier subsidiaries. If 80 percent or more in value of the stock of a subsidiary is acquired by purchase in a single transaction (or in a series of related transactions during any 12-month period), the value of the subsidiary's stock may not exceed the purchase price of the stock divided by the percentage of the stock (by value) so purchased. For this purpose, stock is acquired by purchase if the transferee is not related to the transferor within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), using the language "10 percent" instead of "50 percent" each place that it appears, and the transferee's basis in the stock is determined wholly by reference to the consideration paid for such stock.

(B) The amounts determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section are not applied more than once to suspend a loss under this section.
