####### Factors not taken into account.

(ii)In determining whether property which is sold or leased to a FSC is sold or leased for direct use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States, the fact that the acquiring FSC holds the property in inventory or for lease prior to the time it sells or leases it for direct use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States will not affect the characterization of the property as export property. Fungible export property must be physically segregated from non-export property at all times after purchase by or rental by a FSC or after the start of the commission relationship between the FSC and related supplier with regard to the export property. Non-fungible export property need not be physically segregated from non-export property.
