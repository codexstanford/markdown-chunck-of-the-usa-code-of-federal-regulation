####### Alternative facts.

(iii)The facts are the same as paragraph (c)(33)(i) of this section, except that instead of P selling its interest in DE1to FS, DE1sells asset A to FSfor $80x and, for Country X tax purposes, FS's tax basis in A immediately after the sale is $80x. P's disposition of Asset A constitutes a presumptive triggering event under ยง 1.1503(d)-6(e)(1)(iv) requiring the recapture of the year 1 $20x dual consolidated loss (plus the applicable interest charge). For Country X tax purposes, FS's tax basis in A was not determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of A in the hands of DE1. As a result, the deduction composing the dual consolidated loss will not give rise to an item of deduction or loss in the form of tax basis for Country X tax purposes (for example, when FSdisposes of A). Therefore, P may be able to demonstrate (for example, by obtaining the opinion of a Country X tax advisor) pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-6(e)(2)(i) that there can be no foreign use of the year 1 dual consolidated loss and, thus, would not be required to recapture the year 1 dual consolidated loss.
