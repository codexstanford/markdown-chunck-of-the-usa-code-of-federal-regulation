####### Section 163(j) limitation.

(iv)D's section 163(j) limitation in Year 2 is $102x, which is determined by adding D's business interest income, or $0, 30 percent of D's ATI for year 2, $102 ($340x x 30 percent), and D's floor plan financing for Year 2, or $0 ($0 + ($102x) + $0). Accordingly, before the application of section 469 in Year 2, $102x of D's $440x of total business interest expense (determined by adding $340x of disallowed business interest expense carryforward from Year 1 and $100x of business interest expense in Year 2) is deductible. D has $338x of disallowed business interest expense carryforward that will carry forward to subsequent taxable years under ยง 1.163(j)-2(c), determined by subtracting D's deductible business interest expense in Year 2, or $102x, from D's total business interest expense in Year 2, or $440x ($440x-$102x).
