###### § 1.1400Z2(a)-1 Deferring tax on capital gains by investing in opportunity zones.
####### Annual reporting of qualifying investments.

(2)An eligible taxpayer must report any qualifying investment held at any point during the taxable year in accordance with guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or in forms and instructions (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter). A failure to make this report for any given taxable year will result in a rebuttable presumption that the taxpayer has had an inclusion event described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c) during that year. The presumption described in the previous sentence may be rebutted by the taxpayer making the report described in the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(2) or by the taxpayer establishing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that an inclusion event described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c) did not occur during that taxable year.
