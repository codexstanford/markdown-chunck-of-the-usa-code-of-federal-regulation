####### Designations.

(3)The party with the obligation to file the annual information return under this section may designate by written agreement any other person to satisfy the requirements of this section. Thus, notwithstanding the rule in paragraph (d)(2) of this section imposing the obligation to file the annual information return on the electronic payment facilitator in lieu of the payment settlement entity, the payment settlement entity may file the information return by designation if the parties agree in writing. However, a designation does not relieve the party with the reporting obligation from liability for any reporting failures. The party with the obligation to file the annual information return under this section remains liable for any applicable penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 if the requirements of this section are not satisfied.
