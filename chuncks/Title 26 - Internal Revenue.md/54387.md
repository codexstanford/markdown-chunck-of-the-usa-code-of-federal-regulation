###### § 1.1504-3 Treatment of stock in a QOF C corporation for purposes of consolidation.
####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, stock of a QOF C corporation (qualifying or otherwise) is not treated as stock for purposes of determining whether the QOF C corporation may join in the filing of a consolidated return. Thus, because no election has been made under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, once Q1 becomes a QOF, Q1 ceases to be affiliated with the P group members for purposes of section 1501, and it deconsolidates from the P group. See §§ 1.1502-1 through 1.1502-100 generally for the consequences of deconsolidation.

(2) [Reserved]
