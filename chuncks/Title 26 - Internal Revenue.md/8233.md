####### Application of section 382.

(10)In the event of an ownership change, within the meaning of section 382(g), the S corporation's business interest expense is subject to section 382. Therefore, the allocation of the S corporation's business interest expense between the pre-change period (as defined in § 1.382-6(g)(2)) and the post-change period (as defined in § 1.382-6(g)(3)), and the determination of the amount that is deducted and carried forward, is determined pursuant to § 1.382-6. If the date of the ownership change is also the date of a qualifying disposition (as defined in § 1.1368-1(g)(2)) or the date for a termination of shareholder interest (as defined in § 1.1377-1(b)(4)), then-

(i) The rules of this paragraph govern the S corporation's business interest expense;

(ii) The S corporation must make an election under § 1.382-6(b) with respect to such date if it also makes an election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2) or a shareholder termination election to apply normal tax accounting rules, as applicable, with respect to such date; and

(iii) The S corporation may not make an election under § 1.382-6(b) with respect to such date if it does not make an election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2) or a termination election under § 1.1377-1(b)(1), as applicable, with respect to such date.
