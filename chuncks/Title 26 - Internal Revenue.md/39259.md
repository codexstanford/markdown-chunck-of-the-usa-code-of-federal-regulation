####### A-10:

If a taxpayer enters into a contract after March 15, 1984, and before January 1, 1985, the taxpayer will be treated as having satisfied the foreign management tests of section 924(c) for periods before December 31, 1984, and the foreign economic process tests of section 924(d) with respect to costs incurred before December 31, 1984, but only with respect to income attributable to such contract that is recognized before December 31, 1985.

The FSC rules will apply to the income from the long-term contract if an election is made and the general requirements under section 922 are satisfied. However, such taxpayer need not satisfy the activities test under section 925(c) for activities which occur before January 1, 1985 in order to use the transfer pricing rules under section 925.
