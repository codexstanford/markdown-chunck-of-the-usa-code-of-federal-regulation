####### Extraordinary collection actions,In general.

(b)-(1)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), the following actions taken by a hospital facility against an individual related to obtaining payment of a bill for care covered under the hospital facility's FAP are ECAs:

(i) Selling an individual's debt to another party (other than debt sales described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).

(ii) Reporting adverse information about the individual to consumer credit reporting agencies or credit bureaus.

(iii) Deferring or denying, or requiring a payment before providing, medically necessary care because of an individual's nonpayment of one or more bills for previously provided care covered under the hospital facility's FAP (which is considered an ECA to obtain payment for the previously provided care, not the care being potentially deferred or denied). If a hospital facility requires a payment before providing medically necessary care to an individual with one or more outstanding bills for previously provided care, such a requirement for payment will be presumed to be because of the individual's nonpayment of such bill(s) unless the hospital facility can demonstrate that it required the payment from the individual based on factors other than, and without regard to, the individual's nonpayment of past bills.

(iv) Actions that require a legal or judicial process, including but not limited to-

(A) Placing a lien on an individual's property (other than a lien described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);

(B) Foreclosing on an individual's real property;

(C) Attaching or seizing an individual's bank account or any other personal property;

(D) Commencing a civil action against an individual;

(E) Causing an individual's arrest;

(F) Causing an individual to be subject to a writ of body attachment; and

(G) Garnishing an individual's wages.
