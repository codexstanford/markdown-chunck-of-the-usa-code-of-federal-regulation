###### ยง 1.1502-15 SRLY limitation on built-in losses.
####### Subgroup rules.

(4)In general, in the case of built-in losses for which there is a SRLY subgroup and the corporations joining the group at the time of the SRLY event also constitute a loss subgroup (as defined in ยง 1.1502-91(d)(2)), the principles of this paragraph (g) apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies with respect to built-in losses only if-

(i) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to those built-in losses are also included in a loss subgroup (as defined in ยง 1.1502-91(d)(2)); and

(ii) All members of a loss subgroup (as defined in ยง 1.1502-91(d)(2)) are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to those built-in losses.
