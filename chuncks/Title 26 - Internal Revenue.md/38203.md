(B)The disregarded payment from P, a United States person, to FDE, its foreign branch, is not recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to P because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated and apportioned to the $400x of P's foreign source services income. Accordingly, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)() of this section, the amount of gross income attributable to the FDE foreign branch (and the gross income attributable to P) is adjusted in Year 1 to take the disregarded payment into account. As such, $400x of P's foreign source gross income from the performance of services is attributable to the FDE foreign branch for purposes of this section. Therefore, $400x of the foreign source gross income that P earned with respect to its services in Year 1 constitutes gross income that is assigned to the foreign branch category.
