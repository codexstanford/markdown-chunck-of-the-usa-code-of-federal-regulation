####### Certain 60-month terminations.

(ii)Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, if an organization fails to satisfy the requirements of section 509(a)(1), section 509(a)(2), or section 509(a)(3) for the continuous 60-month period but does satisfy the requirements of section 509(a)(1), section 509(a)(2), or section 509(a)(3), as the case may be, for any taxable year or years during such 60-month period, the organization shall be treated as a section 509(a)(1), section 509(a)(2), or section 509(a)(3) organization for such taxable year or years, and grants or contributions made during such taxable year or years shall be treated as made to an organization described in section 509(a)(1), section 509(a)(2), or section 509(a)(3). In addition, sections 507 through 509 and Chapter 42 shall not apply to such organization for any taxable year within such 60-month period for which it does meet such requirements. For purposes of determining whether an organization satisfies the requirements of section 509(a)(1), section 509(a)(2), or section 509(a)(3) for any taxable year in the 60-month period, the calculation of public support shall be made over the period beginning with the date of the commencement of the 60-month period, and ending with the last day of the taxable year being tested. The organization shall not be treated as a section 509(a)(1) or section 509(a)(2) organization for any taxable year during the 60-month period solely by reason of having met a public support test for the preceding year. In addition, the transition rules in §§ 1.170-9(f)(14)(iii) and 1.509(a)-3(n)(iii) shall not apply.
