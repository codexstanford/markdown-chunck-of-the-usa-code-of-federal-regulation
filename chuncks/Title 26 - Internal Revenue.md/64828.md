###### ยง 31.3406(b)(2)-2 Original issue discount.
####### Original issue discount subject to backup withholding.

(a)The amount of original issue discount, treated as interest, subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6049, but is limited to the amount of cash paid. In addition, if an original issue discount obligation, subject to reporting under section 6045, is sold prior to maturity and with respect to the seller a condition exists for imposing withholding under section 3406 on the gross proceeds, then withholding under ยง 31.3406(b)(3)-2 applies to the gross proceeds of the sale reportable under section 6045, and not to the amount of any original issue discount includible in the gross income of the seller for the calendar year of the sale. See ยง 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
