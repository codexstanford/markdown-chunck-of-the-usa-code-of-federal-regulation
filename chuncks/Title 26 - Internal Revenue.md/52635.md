###### ยง 1.1502-21 Net operating losses.
####### 2

() T's remaining $10 of net operating loss carryover from 2017 and its $50 net operating loss carryover from 2021 are both SRLY losses in the P group. See ยง 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's net operating loss carryovers are subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The SRLY limitation for the P group's 2022 consolidated return year is consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's $70 of items.
