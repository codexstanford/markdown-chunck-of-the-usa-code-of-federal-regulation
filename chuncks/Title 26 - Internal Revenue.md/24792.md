####### Example 1: Provision of services included in AFS revenue with full inclusion method for advance payments,Facts.

(i)-(A)In 2021, D, an engineering services provider, enters into a nonseverable contract with a customer to provide engineering services through 2024 for a total of $100x. Under the contract, D receives payments of $25x in each calendar year of the contract. For its AFS, D reports $50x, $0, $20x, and $30x of AFS revenue from the contract for 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. D has an enforceable right to recover all amounts reported as AFS revenue through the end of a given contract year if the customer were to terminate the contract on the last day of such year. The $25x payment received in 2023 is an advance payment, as defined in ยง 1.451-8(a)(1), because $5x of the $25x payment is reported as AFS revenue for 2024. D uses the full inclusion method for advance payments.
