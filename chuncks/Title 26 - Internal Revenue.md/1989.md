####### Unused credit year.

(ii)Section 46(a)(1) provides a first-in-first-out rule for the investment credit in a taxable year. Section 46(b)(1) provides for the carryback and carryover of unused credits. If less than all of a taxpayer's credit earned for a taxable year is allowable, the 10-percent credit determined under section 46(a)(2)(A) earned for a particular year is allowed first. Any portion of the additional credit for a taxable year that is not allowable may be carried back or carried over to the extent permitted by section 46(b)(1). However, an additional credit which is allowed for a taxable year is not reduced by a carryback to that year of an unused credit from a succeeding taxable year.
