In determining whether a new principal residence qualifies for purposes of this section the rules relating to construction, acquisition, and occupancy under ยง 1.44-2 do not apply. Where a disposition has occurred and the taxpayer's purchase (or construction) costs of a new principal residence are less than the adjusted sales price (as defined in section 1034(b)) of the old residence, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year following the taxable year during which disposition occurs is increased by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount allowed as a credit for the purchase of the old residence as (i) the adjusted sales price of the old residence (within the meaning of section 1034), reduced (but not below zero) by the taxpayer's cost of purchasing (or constructing) the new residence (within the meaning of such section) bears to (ii) the adjusted sales price of the old residence.
