###### ยง 1.28-1 Credit for clinical testing expenses for certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions.
####### Special rule where the timing of clinical testing is manipulated.

(B)If the timing of clinical testing by members using different tax accounting periods is manipulated to generate a credit in excess of the amount that would be allowable if all members of the group used the same tax accounting period, the district director may require all members of the group to calculate the credit in the current taxable year and all future years by using the "conformed years" method. Each member computing a credit under the "conformed years" method shall compute the credit as if all members of the group had the same taxable year as the computing member.
