####### Variable interest crediting rate under a statutory hybrid benefit formula.

(G)For plan years that begin on or after January 1, 2012 (or an earlier date as elected by the taxpayer), a plan that determines any portion of the participant's accrued benefit pursuant to a statutory hybrid benefit formula (as defined in ยง 1.411(a)(13)-1(d)(4)) that utilizes an interest crediting rate described in ยง 1.411(b)(5)-1(d) that is a variable rate that was less than zero for the prior plan year is not treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the current plan year merely because the plan assumes for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the variable rate is zero for the current plan year and all future plan years.
