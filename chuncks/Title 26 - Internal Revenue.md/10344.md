###### ยง 1.170A-4A Special rule for the deduction of certain charitable contributions of inventory and other property.
####### Basis of contributed property which is inventory.

(2)For the purposes of this section, notwithstanding the rules of ยง 1.170A-1(c)(4), the basis of contributed property which is inventory must be determined under the donor's method of accounting for inventory for purposes of United States income tax. The donor must use as the basis of the contributed item the inventoriable carrying cost assigned to any similar item not included in closing inventory. For example, under the LIFO dollar value method of accounting for inventory, where there has been an invasion of a prior year's layer, the donor may choose to treat the item contributed as having a basis of the unit's cost with reference to the layer(s) of prior year(s) cost or with reference to the current year cost.
