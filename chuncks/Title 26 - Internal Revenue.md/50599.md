####### Consolidated obligations.,consolidated obligations

(23)The termmeans multiple obligations that a withholding agent (including a withholding agent that is an FFI) has chosen to treat as a single obligation in order to treat the obligations as preexisting obligations pursuant to paragraph (b)(104)(ii) of this section or in order to share documentation between the obligations pursuant to § 1.1471-3(c)(8). A withholding agent that has opted to treat multiple obligations as consolidated obligations pursuant to the previous sentence must also treat the obligations as a single obligation for purposes of satisfying the standards of knowledge requirements set forth in §§ 1.1471-3(e) and 1.1471-4(c)(2)(ii), and for purposes of determining the balance or value of any of the obligations when applying any of the account thresholds applicable to due diligence or reporting as set forth in §§ 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii), 1.1471-3(d), 1.1471-4(c), 1.1471-5(a)(4), and 1.1471-5(b)(3)(vii). For example, with respect to consolidated obligations, if a withholding agent has reason to know that the chapter 4 status assigned to the account holder or payee of one of the consolidated obligations is inaccurate, then it has reason to know that the chapter 4 status assigned for all other consolidated obligations of the account holder or payee is inaccurate. Similarly, to the extent that an account balance or value is relevant for purposes of applying any account threshold to one or more of the consolidated obligations, the withholding agent must aggregate the balance or value of all such consolidated obligations.
