####### Special rule for computing days.

(iii)Semi-weekly depositors have at least three business days following the close of the semi-weekly period by which to deposit employment taxes accumulated during the semi-weekly period. Business days include every calendar day other than Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays in the District of Columbia under section 7503. If any of the three weekdays following the close of a semi-weekly period is a legal holiday, the employer has an additional day for each day that is a legal holiday by which to make the required deposit. For example, if the Monday following the close of a Wednesday to Friday semi-weekly period is Memorial Day, a legal holiday, the required deposit for the semi-weekly period is not due until the following Thursday rather than the following Wednesday.
