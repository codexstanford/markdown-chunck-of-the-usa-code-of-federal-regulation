####### deemed transferor ED account

(i) A ratable portion of the transferee ED account is treated as retaining its status as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the transferor SFC and is not treated as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the transferee SFC (the transferee ED account to such extent, the), based on the adjustment amount relative to the balance of the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)) immediately after the adjustment transaction. Thus, for example, whether or not the transferor SFC is in existence immediately after the transaction, the items of specified property that correspond to the deemed transferor ED account are the same as the items of specified property that correspond to the transferor ED account. As an additional example, whether or not the transferor SFC is in existence immediately after the transaction the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage with respect to the deemed transferor ED account is the same as the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage with respect to the transferor ED account (except to the extent the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage is adjusted pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section).

(ii) In the case of an amount (such as an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount) determined by reference to the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)), the portion of the amount that is considered attributable to the deemed transferor ED account (and not the transferee ED account) is equal to the product of such amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the balance of the deemed transferor ED account, and the denominator of which is the balance of the transferee ED account (determined without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)). Thus, for example, if after an adjustment transaction the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)) gives rise to an extraordinary disposition amount, and if the fraction (expressed as a percentage) is 40, then, for purposes of this section, 40 percent of the extraordinary disposition amount is treated as attributable to the deemed transferor ED account and the remaining 60 percent of the extraordinary disposition amount is attributable to the transferee ED account, and the balance of each of the deemed transferor ED account and the transferee ED account is correspondingly reduced.
