(ii)A corporation may determine the applicable years for qualified investments made in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1976, under the following method: The first applicable year with respect to the additional credit for a given year's qualified investment is the year the qualified investment is made or, if later, the first taxable year for which any additional credit is allowable if claimed for that qualified investment. If there is an investment credit carryover from the first applicable year, each taxable year to which any part of the additional credit for that qualified investment is carried over is also an applicable year. If the carryover treatment is elected for the additional credit attributable to a year's qualified investment, all applicable years for the additional credit attributable to that investment must be determined under the carryover option.
