###### § 1.245A(d)-1 Disallowance of foreign tax credit or deduction.
####### Attribution of foreign income taxes to non-inclusion income.

(C)Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax may be attributed to non-inclusion income of CFC if the tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to either the characterization of the tax book value of stock under § 1.861-9 or the income of a foreign corporation that is a reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC. CFC is neither a reverse hybrid nor a foreign law CFC. In addition, no portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to the characterization of the tax book value of CFC's stock. See § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i). Therefore, none of the tax is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC.
