(6)is the section 1248 amount with respect to the stock (or a portion of a share of stock) of the foreign distributed corporation received by a distributee, computed immediately after the distribution, but without taking into account any adjustments to the basis of the stock under § 1.1248(f)-2(b)(3) (in the case of an existing stock distribution) or adjustments to the basis of stock or income inclusions under § 1.1248(f)-2(c)(3) (in the case of a new stock distribution).
