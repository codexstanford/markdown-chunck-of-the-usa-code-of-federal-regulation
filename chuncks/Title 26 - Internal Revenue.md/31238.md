####### Effect of other distributions.

(b)The income of the beneficiary, for any of his prior taxable years for which a tax is being recomputed under ยง 1.668(b)-1A, shall include any amounts of prior accumulation distributions (including prior capital gain distributions) deemed distributed under sections 666 and 669 in such prior taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a "prior accumulation distribution" is a distribution from the same or another trust which was paid, credited, or required to be distributed in a prior taxable year of the beneficiary. The term "prior accumulation distribution" also includes accumulation distributions of other trusts which were paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the beneficiary in the same taxable year and which the beneficiary has determined under paragraph (c) of this section to treat as having been distributed before the accumulation distribution for which tax is being computed under ยง 1.668(b)-1A. Any capital gain distribution from the same trust paid, credited, or required to be distributed in the same taxable year of the beneficiary shall not be considered under this paragraph to be a "prior capital gain distribution."
