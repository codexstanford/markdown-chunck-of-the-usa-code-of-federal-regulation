######## Information to be furnished for any modification request.,h

(ii)In the case of any modification request, the partnership representative must furnish to the IRS such information as is required by forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS or that is otherwise requested by the IRS related to the requested modification. Such information may include a detailed description of the partnership's structure, allocations, ownership, and ownership changes, its relevant partners for each taxable year relevant to the request for modification, as well as the partnership agreement as defined in ยง 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)() of this chapter for each taxable year relevant to the modification request. In the case of any modification request with respect to a relevant partner that is an indirect partner, the partnership representative must provide to the IRS any information that the IRS may require relevant to any pass-through partner or wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes through which the relevant partner holds its interest in the partnership. For instance, if the partnership requests modification with respect to an amended return filed by a relevant partner pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the partnership representative may be required to provide to the IRS information that would have been required to have been filed by pass-through partners through which the relevant partner holds its interest in the partnership as if those pass-through partners had also filed their own amended returns.
