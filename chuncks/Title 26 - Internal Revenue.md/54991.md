###### ยง 1.5000C-3 Payment and returns of tax withheld by the acquiring agency.
####### In general.

(a)This section provides administrative procedures that acquiring agencies must follow to satisfy their obligations to deposit and report amounts withheld under ยง 1.5000C-2. An acquiring agency with a section 5000C withholding obligation must increase the amount it deducts and withholds under chapter 3 for fixed or determinable annual or periodical income (FDAP income) by the amount it must withhold under ยง 1.5000C-2. Accordingly, this section generally applies the administrative provisions of chapter 3 for FDAP income relating to the deposit, payment, and reporting for amounts withheld under ยง 1.5000C-2, and contains some variation from those provisions to take into account the nature of the tax imposed under section 5000C.
