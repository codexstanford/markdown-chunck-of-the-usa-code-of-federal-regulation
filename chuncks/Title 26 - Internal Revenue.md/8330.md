###### ยง 1.163(j)-6 Application of the section 163(j) limitation to partnerships and subchapter S corporations.
####### Section 163(j) remedial items and partner basis items.

(ii)LM sells the asset contributed by L in a fully taxable transaction at a time when the adjusted basis of the property is $4,000. Under ยง 1.163(j)-6(e)(2)(ii), solely for purposes of ยง 1.163(j)-6, the tax gain of $6,000 is allocated equally between L and M ($3,000 each). To avoid shifting built-in gain to the non-contributing partner (M) in a manner consistent with the rule in section 704(c), a remedial deduction of $3,000 is allocated to M (leaving M with no net tax gain), and remedial income of $3,000 is allocated to L (leaving L with total tax gain of $6,000).
