####### Restoration rule.

(xii)The carryback of a life consolidated net operating loss or life consolidated net capital loss under paragraph (g) of this section that reduces consolidated LICTI (or life consolidated capital gain net income) for a prior year may reduce the amount of nonlife subgroup losses that would offset consolidated LICTI in that prior year. Thus, that amount may be carried over under paragraph (f)(2) or (3) of this section from that prior year in determining nonlife consolidated taxable income in a succeeding year or serve as offsetable nonlife subgroup losses in a succeeding year.
