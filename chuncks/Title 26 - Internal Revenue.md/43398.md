####### Proof of satisfaction of 50-percent manufactured or processed test.,a

(x)() No substantiation is required to establish that either the cost test or the fair market value test of subdivisions (iv) or (v) of this subparagraph is satisfied or that a product or commodity qualifies under (viii) of this subdivision as either a used 50-percent manufactured or processed product or as scrap from a 50-percent manufactured or processed product as long as it is reasonably obvious, on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances, that either the cost test or fair market value test is satisfied, or that the product or commodity qualifies as either as used 50-percent manufactured or processed product or as scrap from a 50-percent manufactured or processed product. Thus, for example, in the case of a DISC exporting a high precision lens at least 50 percent of the fair market value of which is obviously attributable to grinding, no substantiation of gross income from the property properly allocable to the depletable products contained in the lens, cost, or fair market values will be required.
