###### ยง 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Anti-avoidance rule.

(2)The purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations are to provide specified tax benefits to owners of QOFs to encourage the making of longer-term investments, through QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses, of new capital in one or more qualified opportunity zones and to increase the economic growth of such qualified opportunity zones. If a transaction is engaged in or structured with a view to avoid the application of the rules of section 1400Z-2, the section 1400Z-2 regulations, or the regulations in this part under section 1502 of the Code (including this section), appropriate adjustments will be made to carry out the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. For example, if a consolidated group engages in a restructuring (such as a distribution described in section 355) with a view to using stock basis adjustments under ยง 1.1502-32 resulting from increases in the basis of stock under section 1400Z-2(b) in a sale or exchange transaction without disposing of any part of the consolidated group's direct ownership of the relevant qualifying investment, the transaction will be treated as an inclusion event with regard to an appropriate amount of deferred gain.
