###### ยง 1.1059A-1 Limitation on taxpayer's basis or inventory cost in property imported from related persons.
####### Relationship of section 1059A to section 482.

(7)Neither this section nor section 1059A limits in any way the authority of the Commissioner to increase or decrease the claimed basis or inventory cost under section 482 or any other appropriate provision of law. Neither does this section or section 1059A permit a taxpayer to adjust upward its cost basis or inventory cost for property appropriately determined under section 482 because such basis or inventory cost is less than the customs value with respect to such property.
