###### ยง 1.1061-2 Applicable partnership interests and applicable trades or businesses.
####### Example 3: Passthrough Interest, Indirect API, Passthrough Taxpayer.

(iii)Each of A, B, and C provides services to, and is an equal partner in, GP. GP is engaged in an ATB as defined in ยง 1.1061-1(a), is the general partner of PRS, and provides substantial management services to PRS. In connection with GP's performance of substantial services in an ATB, PRS issues a profits interest to GP. Because GP's PRS interest was received in connection with GP's providing services in an ATB, GP is a Passthrough Taxpayer and GP's interest in PRS is an API. Because A, B, and C are partners in GP, they each hold a Passthrough Interest in GP and an Indirect API in PRS. Each of A, B, and C is treated as an Owner Taxpayer because each is a partner in GP and because each holds an Indirect API in PRS in connection with the performance of its services to GP's ATB.
