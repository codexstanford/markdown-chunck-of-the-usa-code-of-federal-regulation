###### ยง 1.381(c)(9)-1 Amortization of bond discount or premium.
####### Carryover requirement.

(a)If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for the payment of bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium, then under the provisions of section 381(c)(9) the acquiring corporation is to be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for purposes of determining the amount of amortization allowable, or includible, with respect to such discount or premium in computing taxable income. Thus, if subsequent to February 28, 1913, a distributor or transferor corporation issues bonds at a premium and the liability for them is assumed by the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the net amount of the premium is income which should be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds, including the period during which the acquiring corporation is liable upon the obligations assumed. On the other hand, if a distributor or transferor corporation issues bonds at a discount and the liability for them is assumed by the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the net amount of the discount is deductible in computing taxable income but should be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds, including the period during which the acquiring corporation is liable upon the obligations assumed.
