####### Transactions of domestic building and loan associations.

(6)The rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section (and the application of those rules by virtue of paragraph (j)(3) of this section) shall not apply to a public offering of stock by a domestic building and loan association described in section 591 (or any corporation that owns stock in the association meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)) prior to January 1, 1989. In the case of any transaction described in the preceding sentence, any transitory ownership of stock by any entity that is an underwriter shall be disregarded so that the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall not apply to treat such stock as owned by the owners of the underwriter and thus the rules of paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to the disposition of such stock by the underwriter. For purposes of this paragraph (m)(7)-

(i) Ownership shall be considered transitory only with respect to an underwriter acquiring stock in a firm commitment underwriting to the extent the stock is disposed of pursuant to the offer (but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the initial offering) and,

(ii) To the extent a transaction may be described both by paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and any other provision of paragraph (j)(2)(iii) or (3) of this section, paragraph (j)(2)(v)(A) of this section shall not apply and the transaction shall be treated as described solely by paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
