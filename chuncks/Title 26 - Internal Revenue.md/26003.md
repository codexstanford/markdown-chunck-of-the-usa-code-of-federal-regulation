Finally, under ยง 1.468A-2(e), an electing taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting is allowed a deduction for nuclear decommissioning costs that are incurred during any taxable year even if such costs are incurred after substantial completion of decommissioning (for example, expenses incurred to monitor or safeguard the plant site).
