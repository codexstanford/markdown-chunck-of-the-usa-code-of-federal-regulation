####### Owner-documented FFIs,In general.

(3)-(i)An owner-documented FFI means an FFI that meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. An FFI may only be treated as an owner-documented FFI with respect to payments received from and accounts held with a designated withholding agent (or with respect to payments received from and accounts held with another FFI that is also treated as an owner-documented FFI by such designated withholding agent). A designated withholding agent is a U.S. financial institution, participating FFI, or reporting Model 1 FFI that agrees to undertake the additional due diligence and reporting required under paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section in order to treat the FFI as an owner-documented FFI. An FFI meeting the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3) will only be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI with respect to a payment or account for which it does not act as an intermediary.
