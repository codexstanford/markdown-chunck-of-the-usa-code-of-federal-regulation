####### Analysis.

(B)A principal purpose of the steps undertaken was to avoid treatment of a lending transaction between S1 and S2 as an intercompany transaction. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, appropriate adjustments are made, and the X obligation in the hands of S1 is not treated as an asset of S1 for purposes of ยง 1.163(j)-10, to the extent of the loan from X to S2.

(i) [Reserved]
