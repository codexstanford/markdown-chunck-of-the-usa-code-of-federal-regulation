###### ยง 1.9200-2 Manner of taking deduction.
####### Filing and amendment of returns.

(b)A taxpayer who has filed its return for the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, claiming the deduction allowed under ยง 1.9200-1, may amend its return for such year in order to elect under ยง 1.9200-1(c)(1)(ii) to begin the 60-month period in the subsequent taxable year. A taxpayer eligible to take the deduction under ยง 1.9200-1 who has filed its returns for both the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, and the following taxable year without claiming the deduction, may claim the deduction by filing amended returns or claims for refund for the taxable year in which the taxpayer elects to begin the 60-month period, and for subsequent taxable years. If a taxpayer first claims the deduction on an amended return under the preceding sentence, the statement required by paragraph (a) of this section must be attached to such amended return.
