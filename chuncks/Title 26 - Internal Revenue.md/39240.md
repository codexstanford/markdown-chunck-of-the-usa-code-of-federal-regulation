####### Q-4:

Since a FSC, small FSC, and interest charge DISC must use the same annual accounting period as the principal shareholder, must such corporation delay the beginning of its first taxable year beyond January 1, 1985 if the principal shareholder (the shareholder with the highest percentage of voting power as defined in section 441(h)) is not a calendar year taxpayer?
