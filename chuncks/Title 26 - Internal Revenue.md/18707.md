###### § 1.382-3 Definitions and rules relating to a 5-percent shareholder.
####### Issuance of stock pursuant to the exercise of certain options.

(10)If stock is issued on the exercise of a transferable option issued by the loss corporation, § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(F) does not apply and, in applying the last sentence of § 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation must take into account any transfers of the option (including transfers described in § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(xi)). Therefore, even if transferable options are distributed pro rata to members of existing public groups, the actual knowledge exception of § 1.382-2T(k)(2) applies only to the extent that the loss corporation actually knows that the persons acquiring stock on exercise of the options are members of a pre-existing public group. Moreover, if transferable options are issued to more than one public group, § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(F) does not apply to treat the options as exercised pro rata by each such public group as the options are actually exercised.
