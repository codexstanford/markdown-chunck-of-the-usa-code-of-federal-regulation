###### ยง 1.163(j)-2 Deduction for business interest expense limited.
####### Analysis.

(ii)For the 2021 taxable year, X's section 163(j) limitation is $60x, which is the sum of its business interest income ($20x), plus 30 percent of its ATI ($100x x 30 percent = $30x), plus its floor plan financing interest expense ($10x). See ยง 1.163(j)-2(b). Because X's business interest expense ($50x) does not exceed X's section 163(j) limitation ($60x), X can deduct all $50x of its business interest expense for the 2021 taxable year.
