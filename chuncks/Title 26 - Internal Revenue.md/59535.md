###### Benefits, rights, and features,Defined benefit excess plan.

(f)-(1)In the case of a defined benefit excess plan, each benefit, right, or feature provided under the plan with respect to employer-provided benefits attributable to average annual compensation above the integration level (an "excess benefit, right, or feature") must also be provided on the same terms with respect to employer-provided benefits attributable to average annual compensation up to the integration level (a "base benefit, right, or feature"). Alternatively, an excess benefit, right, or feature may be provided on different terms than the base benefit, right, or feature, if the terms used to determine the base benefit, right, or feature produce a benefit, right, or feature of inherently equal or greater value than the benefit, right, or feature that would be produced under the terms used to determine the excess benefit, right, or feature.
