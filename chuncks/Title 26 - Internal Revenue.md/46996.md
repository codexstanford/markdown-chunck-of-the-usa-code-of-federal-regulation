####### Special rule when only part of an asset produces income.

(ii)For purposes of section 1297, when only a portion of an asset produces income during a taxable year or a portion of a taxable year, the asset is treated as two assets for that period, one of which is characterized as a passive asset or a non-passive asset based on the income that it produces, and one of which is characterized based on the income that it is held to produce. The value (or adjusted basis) of the asset is allocated between the two assets pursuant to the method that most reasonably reflects the uses of the property. In the case of real property, an allocation based on the physical use of the property generally is the most reasonable method.
