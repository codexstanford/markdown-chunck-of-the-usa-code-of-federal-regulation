####### Determination of the portion of a repurchase premium attributable to the cost of borrowing and not attributable to the conversion feature.

(2)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the portion of a repurchase premium which is attributable to the cost of borrowing and which is not attributable to the conversion feature is the amount by which the selling price of the convertible obligation increased between the dates it was issued and repurchased by reason of a decline in yields on comparable nonconvertible obligations traded on an established securities market or, if such comparable traded obligations do not exist, by reason of a decline in yields generally on nonconvertible obligations which are as nearly comparable as possible.

(ii) In determining the amount under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, appropriate consideration shall be given to all factors affecting the selling price or yields of comparable nonconvertible obligations. Such factors include general changes in prevailing yields of comparable obligations between the dates the convertible obligation was issued and repurchased and the amount (if any) by which the selling price of the nonconvertible obligation was affected by reason of any change in the issuing corporation's credit quality or the credit quality of the obligation during such period (determined on the basis of widely published financial information or on the basis of other relevant facts and circumstances which reflect the relative credit quality of the corporation or the comparable obligation).

(iii) The relationship between selling price and yields in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall ordinarily be determined by means of standard bond tables.
