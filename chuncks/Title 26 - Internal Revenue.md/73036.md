####### ยง 301.6225-1 Partnership adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.
######## Example 14.,Example 13

(14)The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(13) of this section (), but the negative adjustment to credits is $50 instead of $20. Applying the credits results in an amount less than zero as described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section ($40-$50-$25 = -$35). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the imputed underpayment is recalculated without regard to the adjustment to the chapter 1 tax liability, resulting in a recalculation amount less than zero as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section ($40-$50 = -$10). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the partnership adjustments resulting in the -$10 recalculation amount are adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment treated in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, and the $25 adjustment to chapter 1 tax liability is not treated as such an adjustment and is therefore not taken into account on the partnership's adjustment year return.
