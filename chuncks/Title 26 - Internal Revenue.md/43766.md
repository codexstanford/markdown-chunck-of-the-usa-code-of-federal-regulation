##### Determination of Amount of and Recognition of Gain or Loss
###### § 1.1001-6 Transition from certain interbank offered rates.
####### Contemporaneous noncovered modifications.

(2)If a covered modification is made at the same time as a noncovered modification, § 1.1001-1(a) or § 1.1001-3, as appropriate, applies to determine whether the noncovered modification results in the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or in extent. In applying § 1.1001-1(a) or § 1.1001-3 for this purpose, the covered modification is treated as part of the terms of the contract prior to the noncovered modification. For example, if the parties to a debt instrument modify the interest rate in a manner that is a covered modification and contemporaneously extend the final maturity date of the debt instrument, which is a noncovered modification, only the extension of the final maturity date is analyzed under § 1.1001-3 and, for purposes of that analysis, the modified interest rate is treated as a term of the instrument prior to the extension of the final maturity date.
