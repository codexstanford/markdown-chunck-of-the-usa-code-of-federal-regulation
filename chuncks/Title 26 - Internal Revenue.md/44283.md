####### Determination of sales price.

(3)The price at which the real property was sold shall be, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the gross sales price reduced by the selling commissions, legal fees, and other expenses incident to the sale of such property which are properly taken into account in determining gain or loss on the sale. For example, the amount of selling commissions paid by a nondealer will be deducted from the gross sales price in determining the price at which the real property was sold; on the other hand, selling commissions paid by a real estate dealer will be deducted as a business expense. Examples of other expenses incident to the sale of the property are expenses for appraisal fees, advertising expense, cost of preparing maps, recording fees, and documentary stamp taxes. Payments on indebtedness to the seller which are for interest, stated or unstated, are not included in determining the price at which the property was sold. See paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
