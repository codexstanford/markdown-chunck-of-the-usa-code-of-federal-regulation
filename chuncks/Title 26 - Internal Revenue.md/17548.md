####### Triggering event exceptions.

(k)Notwithstanding paragraph (j) of this section, a disposition or other event described in paragraphs (k)(1) through (14) of this section shall not constitute a triggering event. This paragraph (k) generally provides exceptions for certain dispositions that constitute nonrecognition transactions but only if, immediately after the disposition, a U.S. transferor retains, as applicable, a direct or indirect interest in the transferred stock or securities, or in the assets of the transferred corporation, and a new gain recognition agreement is entered into with respect to the initial transfer in accordance with this paragraph (k). Notwithstanding the application of this paragraph (k), if a gain recognition event described under paragraphs (m) and (n) of this section occurs during the GRA term the U.S. transferor may be required to recognize gain under the gain recognition agreement in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. See paragraph (o) of this section which provides that, notwithstanding paragraph (j) of this section, certain dispositions or other events shall instead terminate or reduce the amount of gain subject to a gain recognition agreement.
