####### Decrease in income not material.

(b)It is not material that the income of a controlled foreign corporation is decreased as a result of the application of paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, in applying ยง 1.953-4 to the income of a controlled foreign corporation described in paragraph (c)(2) of ยง 1.953-5 which would, but for paragraph (a) of this section, be subject to the provisions of section 954, there shall be allowed, in determining the taxable income derived from the insurance of United States risks under ยง 1.953-4, a deduction under section 809(a)(1) for the share of each and every item of investment yield set aside for policyholders; it is not material that in determining foreign base company income such deduction would not be allowed under section 954(b)(5). Further, income of a controlled foreign corporation which is required to be taken into account under section 953 in determining income derived from the insurance of United States risks and would, but for the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, constitute foreign base company income under section 954 shall not be taken into account under section 954(b)(3)(B) in determining whether foreign base company income exceeds 70 percent of gross income for the taxable year.
