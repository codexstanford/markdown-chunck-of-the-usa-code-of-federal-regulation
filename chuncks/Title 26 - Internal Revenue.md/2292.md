###### ยง 1.48-4 Election of lessor of new section 38 property to treat lessee as purchaser.
####### Original use.

(b)For purposes of this section only, the lessor and the lessee may both be considered as the original users of an item of leased property. The determination of whether the lessor qualifies as the original user of leased property shall be made under paragraph (b)(7) of ยง 1.48-2. The determination of whether the lessee qualifies as the original user of leased property shall be made, under paragraph (b)(7) of ยง 1.48-2, as if the lessee actually purchased the property. Thus, the lessee would not be considered the original user of the property if it has been previously used by the lessor or another person, or if it is reconstructed, rebuilt, or reconditioned property. However, the lessee would be considered the original user if he is the first person to use the property for its intended function. Thus, the fact that the lessor may have, for example, tested, stored, or attempted to lease the property to other persons will not preclude the lessee from being considered the original user.
