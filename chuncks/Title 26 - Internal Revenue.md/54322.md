(25)-(i)P owns DE1which, in turn, owns FB. P's interest in DE1and its indirect interest in FBare combined and treated as a single separate unit (Country X separate unit) pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-1(b)(4)(ii). The following items are reflected on the books and records of DE1in year 1: Sales, depreciation expense, a political contribution, royalty expense paid to P, repairs and maintenance expense paid to a third party, and Country X income tax expense. The amount of sales under U.S. tax principles equals the amount of sales reported for accounting purposes. The depreciation expense is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset for accounting purposes, but is subject to accelerated depreciation for U.S. tax purposes. In addition, the repairs and maintenance expense, which is deducted when paid for accounting purposes, is properly capitalized and amortized over five years for U.S. tax purposes. Finally, P elects to claim as a credit under section 901 the Country X income tax expense that was paid in year 1.
