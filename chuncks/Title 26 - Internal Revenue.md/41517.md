()If a foreign corporation for a taxable year has more than one class of stock outstanding, the earnings and profits of such corporation for such year which shall be taken into account with respect to any one class of such stock shall be the earnings and profits which would be distributed with respect to such class if all earnings and profits of such corporation for such year were distributed on the last day of such corporation's taxable year, on which such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation or is a foreign corporation by reason of the ownership of stock in which the United States shareholder indirectly owns within the meaning of section 958(a)(2) stock in a controlled foreign corporation. If an arrearage in dividends for prior taxable years exists with respect to a class of preferred stock of such corporation, the earnings and profits for the taxable year shall be attributed to such arrearage only to the extent such arrearage exceeds the earnings and profits of such corporation remaining from prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation, using the calendar year as its taxable year, has earnings and profits for 1963 of $100 accumulated at December 31, 1963, and an arrearage of $150 for such year in respect of preferred stock, the earnings and profits for 1964 attributable to such arrearage may not exceed $50 ($150-$100).
