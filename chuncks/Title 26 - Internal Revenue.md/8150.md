####### Cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation of -$75x.,Example 3

(C)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, except that S's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation entering the current year is -$75x. After adjusting for S's tax items for the current year ($160x) and the P group's absorption of S's current-year business interest expense ($70x), S's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation is $15x (-$75x + $160x-$70x). Because S's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation ($15x) is less than the amount of S's SRLY-limited disallowed business interest expense carryforwards ($30x), the pro rata calculation under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is applied to $15x (rather than $30x) of S's carryforwards. Accordingly, the P group can deduct $5.56x ($50x x ($15x/$135x)) of S's SRLY-limited disallowed business interest expense carryforwards. S's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation is reduced (to $9.44x) by the $5.56x of SRLY-limited disallowed business interest carryforwards absorbed by the P group in the current year.
