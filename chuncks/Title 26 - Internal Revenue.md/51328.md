####### Remediation of event of default.

(3)A participating FFI will be permitted to remediate an event of default to the extent that it agrees with the IRS on a remediation plan. Such a plan may, for example, allow a participating FFI to remediate an event of default described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section by providing specific information regarding its U.S. accounts when the FFI has been unable to report all of the information with respect to such accounts as required under paragraph (d) of this section and has been unable to close or transfer such accounts. The IRS may, as part of a remediation plan, require additional information from the FFI or the performance of the specified review procedures described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.
