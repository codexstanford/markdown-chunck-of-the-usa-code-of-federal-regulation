######## Withdrawal of NAP or NOPPA.

(f)The IRS may, without consent of the partnership, withdraw any NAP or NOPPA. Except as described in ยง 301.6223-1(d)(2) and (e)(2), if the IRS withdraws a NAP or NOPPA under this paragraph (f), the NAP or NOPPA is treated as if it were never issued, and the withdrawn NAP or NOPPA has no effect for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63. For instance, if the IRS withdraws a NAP with respect to a partnership taxable year, the limitation under ยง 301.6222-1(c)(5) regarding inconsistent treatment, and the prohibition under section 6227(c) on filing an AAR, after the mailing of a NAP no longer applies with respect to such taxable year.
