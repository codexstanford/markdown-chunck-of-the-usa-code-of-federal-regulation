####### Rebuttable presumption.

(C)For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the acquirer is presumed to have a plan to relinquish control of the seller on the date of the acquisition if the acquirer relinquishes control of the seller within the 36-month period following the date of the acquisition. The presumption created by the previous sentence may be rebutted by facts and circumstances clearly establishing that the loss of control was not contemplated on the date of the acquisition and that the avoidance of the purposes of this section or ยง 1.385-3 was not a principal purpose for the subsequent loss of control.
