##### Determination of Sources of Income
###### ยง 1.861-8 Computation of taxable income from sources within the United States and from other sources and activities.
####### iii,Analysis-apportionment.,1

()Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the deduction is ratably apportioned between the statutory grouping (foreign source general category income) and the residual grouping (U.S. source income) on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in each grouping. For purposes of apportioning deductions under ยง 1.861-8T(d)(2)(i)(B), exempt income is not taken into account. Under paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A)() of this section, in the case of an insurance company taxable under section 801, exempt income includes dividends deductible under section 805(a)(4) without regard to any reduction to the DRD for the policyholder's share in section 804(a)(4)(A)(ii). Thus, the gross income taken into account in apportioning $100x of U.S.C.'s remaining reserve deduction is $100x of foreign source general category gross income and $100x of U.S. source gross income. Of U.S.C.'s $100x remaining reserve deduction, $50x ($100x x $100x /$200x) is apportioned to foreign source general category gross income and $50x ($100x x $100x/$200x) is apportioned to U.S. source gross income.
