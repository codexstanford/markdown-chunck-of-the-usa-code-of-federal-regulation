(k)-The termmeans premiums written, including reinsurance premiums written, reduced by reinsurance ceded, and reduced by ceding commissions and medical loss ratio (MLR) rebates with respect to the data year. For this purpose, MLR rebates are computed on an accrual basis in determining net premiums written. Because indemnity reinsurance within the meaning of paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section is not health insurance under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the termdoes not include premiums written for indemnity reinsurance and is not reduced by indemnity reinsurance ceded. However, in the case of assumption reinsurance within the meaning of paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section, the termdoes include premiums written for assumption reinsurance and is reduced by assumption reinsurance premiums ceded.
