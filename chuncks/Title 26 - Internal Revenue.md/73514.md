######## Example 1.

(A)Partnership enters into a transaction with A to purchase widgets for $100 in taxable year 2020. Partnership pays A $100 for the widgets. Any deduction or expense of the Partnership for the purchase of the widgets is an item or amount with respect to Partnership because it is shown on Partnership's return and is relevant to determining the liability of any person under chapter 1 pursuant to paragraphs (a)(6)(iii) and (iv) of this section. Therefore, the deduction or expense is a partnership-related item. However, the income to A resulting from the transaction with Partnership is not an item or amount with respect to Partnership under paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section because although the amount of income relates to a transaction with Partnership and Partnership is required to show a deduction or expense related to the payment to A, the amount of income to A is not shown or required to be shown on Partnership's return. It is only required to be shown of the return of A, a person other than Partnership and requires determinations about A's reporting of the item. Accordingly, the amount of income shown, or required to be shown, by A on his return is not a partnership-related item.
