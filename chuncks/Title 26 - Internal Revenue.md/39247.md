####### A-6:

If the principal shareholder changes its annual accounting period, the FSC must also change its annual accounting period to conform to that of its principal shareholder. If the voting power of the principal shareholder is reduced by an amount equal to at least 10 percent of the total shares entitled to vote and such shareholder is no longer the principal shareholder, the FSC must conform its accounting period to that of its new principal shareholder. However, in determining whether a shareholder is a principal shareholder, the voting power of the shareholders is determined as of the beginning of the FSC's taxable year. Thus, for example, assume that for 1985 a FSC adopts a calendar year period as its annual accounting period to conform to that of its principal shareholder. Assume further than in March 1985 there is a 10 percent change in voting power and a different shareholder whose annual accounting period begins on July 1 becomes the new principal shareholder. The FSC will not be required to adopt the annual accounting period of its new principal shareholder until July 1, 1986. The FSC will have a short taxable year for the period January 1 to June 30, 1986.
