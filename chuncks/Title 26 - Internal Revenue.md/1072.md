####### Analysis.

(B)Taxpayer sought to maintain the status of the over-income units (Unit #1 and Unit #6) as units described in ยง 1.42-19(b)(1)(ii). As the then-market rate units (Units ##5 and 10) became available to rent, Taxpayer designated imputed income limitations for them at 40 percent and 80 percent of AMGI, respectively. Immediately after each designation, the average of the designations in the project does not exceed 60 percent AMGI. Pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, when there are multiple over-income units, Taxpayer is not required to rent the next-available units in a specific order, even though they may have different imputed income limitations. Thus, Taxpayer complied with the rules of the next available unit rule, and Unit #1 and Unit #6 maintain status as units described in ยง 1.42-19(b)(1)(ii).
