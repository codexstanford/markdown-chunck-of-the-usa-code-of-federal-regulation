####### Options that lapse or are forfeited.

(viii)If an option that is treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section lapses unexercised or the owner of such option irrevocably forfeits his right to acquire stock pursuant to the option, the option shall be treated for purposes of this section as if it never had been issued. In that case, the loss corporation may file an amended return for prior years (subject to any applicable statute of limitations) if the section 382 limitation was thus inapplicable. If paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section applied to an option (or options) with respect to a taxable year for which an income tax return has not been filed by the date that the option (or options) lapses or is irrevocably forfeited, the loss corporation may treat paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section as inapplicable to such option (or options).
