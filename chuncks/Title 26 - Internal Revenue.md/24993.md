####### Determining the advance payment income inclusion amount in the year of sale.

(3)The advance payment income inclusion amount for the taxable year in which ownership of the item of inventory is transferred to the customer is equal to the portion of any advance payment for such item that was not required to be included in gross income in a prior taxable year. This amount is not reduced by a cost of goods in progress offset under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. However, the taxpayer is entitled to recover the costs capitalized to the item of inventory as cost of goods sold in accordance with sections 471 and 263A or any other applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code. See ยง 1.61-3.
