####### Contents of the schedule.

(b)The schedule required by subparagraph (A) of section 856(c)(7) must contain a breakdown, or listing, of the total amount of gross income falling under each of the separate subparagraphs of section 856(c) (2) and (3). Thus, for example, the real estate investment trust, for purposes of listing its income from the sources described in section 856(c)(2), would list separately the total amount of dividends, the total amount of interest, the total amount of rents from real property, etc. The listing is not required to be on a lease-by-lease, loan-by-loan, or project-by-project basis, but the real estate investment trust must maintain adequate records on such a basis with which to substantiate each total amount listed in the schedule.
