####### ยง 48.4061(b)-2 Definition of parts or accessories.
######## Articles of a general use.

(b)The term "parts or accessories" does not include articles which are not used primarily in the manufacture, repair, etc., of automobile trucks, other automobiles, or tractors, but have a general use in the manufacture, repair, etc., of various articles. For example, commodities such as ball and roller bearings, bolts, nuts, washers, screws, nails, tacks, rivets, pins, studs, cotters, pipe fittings such as plugs, tees, ells, and elbows, drain cocks, grease cups, oilers, and similar articles are not of themselves parts or accessories unless so constructed as to be used primarily in the manufacture, repair, etc., of automobile trucks, other automobiles, or tractors. On the other hand, parts for automobile parts or accessories are in themselves taxable unless they are articles of a type not specifically designed for use primarily in the automobile field. For example, the tax applies to the sale of gears, flexible shafts and flexible housings designed as replacement parts for automotive speedometers; as well as replacement parts for automobile engines, transmissions, differentials, steering mechanisms, timers, windshild-wiper motors, and other automobile parts or accessories.
