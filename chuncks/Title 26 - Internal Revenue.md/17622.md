(B)() The transfer by UST of the TFC stock to FA is described in section 361(a) and is therefore subject to section 367(a)(5). In general, UST cannot file a gain recognition agreement with respect to such transfer, and the transfer therefore is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1). However, if the conditions of ยง 1.367(a)-3(e)(1)(i) through (iv) are satisfied, USP can enter into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the transfer to avoid the recognition of gain by UST on the transfer under section 367(a)(1). If the exception provided by paragraph (k)(14) of this section applies so that the transfer by UST of the TFC stock to FA is not a triggering event with respect to the gain recognition agreement filed for the initial transfer (discussed in paragraph (q)(2)(vi)(B)() of this section (paragraph () in the results in this), the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement (if entered into) with respect to the transfer by UST of the TFC stock to FA in the asset reorganization is $100x.
