() The $45x and $135x distributions made by DS to USS1 and by USS2 to FP, respectively, are described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the portion of PRS Note treated as issued by DS is treated as funding the distribution made by DS because the distribution occurred within the per se period with respect to PRS Note, but under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, only to the extent of DS's $45x distribution. USS2 is treated as issuing $90x of PRS Note, all of which is treated as funding $90x of USS2's $135x distribution under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, $45x of PRS Note would be treated as stock of DS and $90x of PRS Note would be treated as stock of USS2 on Date B in Year 1, the date of the distributions. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(23) of this section, $45x of PRS Note is a specified portion with respect to DS and $90x of PRS Note is a specified portion with respect to USS2.
