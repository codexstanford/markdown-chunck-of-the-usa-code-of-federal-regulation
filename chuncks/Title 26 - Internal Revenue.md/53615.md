The provisions contained in this Treasury decision are needed to immediately amend the consolidated return regulations in response to changes made by section 1012 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. It is therefore found impracticable and contrary to the public interest to issue this Treasury decision with notice and public procedure under section 553(b) of title 5 of the United States Code or subject to the effective date limitations of section 553(d) of title 5, United States Code.
