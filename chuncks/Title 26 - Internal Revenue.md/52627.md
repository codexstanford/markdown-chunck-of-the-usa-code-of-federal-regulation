() After deduction of T's $32 SRLY net operating loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $40 ($40 x 80 percent = $32). Therefore, the cumulative register is decreased by $40, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($40-$40).
