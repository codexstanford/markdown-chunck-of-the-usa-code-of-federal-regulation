() P carries its remaining $83.81 ($120-$36.19) Year 3 net operating loss and T carries its remaining $58.19 ($60-$1.81) Year 3 net operating loss over to Year 5. Assume that, in Year 5, the P group has $90 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). The P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items is a CNOL of $4. Therefore, the positive balance of the cumulative register of T in Year 5 equals $1.24 ($5.24-$4). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, T's SRLY limitation is $0.99 ($1.24 x 80 percent). For Year 5, the total amount of Year 5 consolidated taxable income available for offset by loss carryovers as a result of the 80-percent limitation is $72 ($90 x 80 percent). Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though one loss arises in a SRLY and the other loss does not. Therefore, $71.16 of P's Year 3 loss is absorbed (($83.81/($83.81 + $0.99)) x $72 = $71.16). In addition, $0.84 of T's Year 3 losses is absorbed (($0.99/($83.81 + $0.99)) x $72 = $0.84).
