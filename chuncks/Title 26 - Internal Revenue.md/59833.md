#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### ยง 1.402(a)-1 Taxability of beneficiary under a trust which meets the requirements of section 401(a).
###### Exception for disability insurance that replaces retirement contributions.

(iii)The rules of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section do not apply to the payment made from a qualified trust that is a premium paid to an insurance company for a contract providing for payment of benefits to be made to the trust in the event of an employee's inability to continue employment with the employer due to disability, provided that the payment of benefits with respect to the employee's account for each year does not exceed the reasonable expectation of the annual contributions that would have been made to the plan on the employee's behalf for the period of disability within that year, reduced by any other contributions made on the employee's behalf for the period of disability within that year. The payment of premiums described in the preceding sentence is not treated as a distribution under section 402(a), but instead constitutes incidental accident or health insurance as provided in ยง 1.401-1(b)(1)(ii). The Commissioner may issue rules of general applicability in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin further describing the tax treatment of disability coverage described in this paragraph (e)(1)(iii).
