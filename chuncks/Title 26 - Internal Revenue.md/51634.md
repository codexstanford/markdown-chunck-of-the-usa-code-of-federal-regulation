####### Remediation of event of default.

(3)A sponsoring entity will be permitted to remediate an event of default to the extent that it agrees with the IRS on a remediation plan. Such a plan may, for example, allow a sponsoring entity to remediate an event of default described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section with respect to a sponsored FFI by providing specific information regarding the U.S. accounts maintained by such sponsored FFI when the sponsoring entity has been unable to report all of the information with respect to such accounts as required under ยง 1.1471-4(d) and has been unable to close or transfer such accounts. The IRS may, as part of a remediation plan, require additional information from the sponsoring entity or the performance of the specified review procedures described in paragraph (j)(4)(ii) of this section.
