###### § 1.444-1T Election to use a taxable year other than the required taxable year (temporary).
####### Special rule for entity that liquidates or is sold prior to making a section 444 election, required return, or required payment.

(iv)A partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation that is liquidated or sold for tax purposes before a section 444 election, required return, or required payment is made for a particular year may, nevertheless, make or continue a section 444 election, if otherwise qualified. (See §§ 1.7519-2T (a)(2) and 1.7519-1T (a)(3), respectively, for a description of the required return and a definition of the term "required payment.") However, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation (or a trustee or agent thereof) must comply with the requirements for making or continuing a section 444 election. Thus, if applicable, required payments must be made and a subsequent claim for refund must be made in accordance with § 1.7519-2T(a)(6). The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(5)(iv).
