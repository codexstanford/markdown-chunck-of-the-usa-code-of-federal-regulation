######## Use of a TTIN.,In general.

(b)(1)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a TTIN may be used to identify any person on any statement or other document that the internal revenue laws require to be furnished to another person. Use of a TTIN is permissive and not mandatory. Use of a TTIN as permitted by this section will not result in application of any penalty for failure to include a correct taxpayer identifying number on any payee statement or other document. For example, the section 6722 penalty for failure to timely furnish a correct statement would not apply solely because the payor used a TTIN as permitted by this section.
