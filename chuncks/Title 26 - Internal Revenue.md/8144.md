####### Analysis.

(B)T's $100x of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from 2021 arose in a SRLY. P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g); thus, T's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. T's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation for 2022 is the P group's section 163(j) limitation, determined by reference solely to T's items for all consolidated return years of the P group ($70x). See paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Thus, $70x of T's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are available to be deducted by the P group in 2022, and the remaining $30x of T's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are carried forward to 2023. After the P group deducts $70x of T's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards, T's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation is reduced by $70x to $0.
