####### Testamentary trust.

(2)A trust with respect to which a deceased individual is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on his death is treated as a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, before his death. However, if such deceased individual was not a resident of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date of his death, then a testamentary trust of which he is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on his death is not treated as a resident of any State. All property passing on the transferor's death is treated for this purpose as a contribution made to the trust on the date of death, regardless of when the property is actually paid over to the trust.
