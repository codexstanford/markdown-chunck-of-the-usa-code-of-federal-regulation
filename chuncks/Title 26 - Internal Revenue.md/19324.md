####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as one corporation for purposes of § 1.385-3. Accordingly, when DS1 issues DS1 Note to USS1 in a distribution on Date A in Year 1, DS1 is not treated as issuing a debt instrument to another member of DS1's expanded group in a distribution for purposes of § 1.385-3(b)(2), and DS1 Note is not treated as stock under § 1.385-3. When USS1 distributes DS1 Note to FP, DS1 Note is deemed satisfied and reissued under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii), immediately before DS1 Note ceases to be an intercompany obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, when USS1 distributes DS1 Note to FP, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as issuing DS1 Note to FP in a distribution on Date B in Year 2. Accordingly, DS1 Note is treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(2)(i). Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, DS1 Note is deemed to be exchanged for stock of the issuing member, DS1, immediately after DS1 Note is transferred outside of the USS1 consolidated group. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the deemed satisfaction and reissuance under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii) and the deemed issuance and exchange under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, are respected as separate steps and treated as separate transactions.
