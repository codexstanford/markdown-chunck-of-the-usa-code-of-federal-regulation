()Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the €280x U.S.C. paid on January 15, Year 4, that relates to its Country X taxable year ending on March 31, Year 3, is first treated as a payment of the €70x = $70x of that Country X net income tax liability that properly accrued and was claimed as a credit by U.S.C. in Year 3, and next as a payment of the €210x = $210x of that Country X net income tax liability that U.S.C. improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 2. Together with the €50x = $50x of U.S.C.'s Country X net income tax liability that properly accrued and was claimed as a credit in Year 2, all €260x of the Country X net income tax that was accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 2 under U.S.C.'s improper method was paid within 24 months of December 31, Year 2. Accordingly, no foreign tax redetermination occurs, and no redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required, for Year 2.
