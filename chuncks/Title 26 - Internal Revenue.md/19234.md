(B)() USS1 is a successor to USS2 under paragraph (g)(24)(i)(A) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, USS2 and, under paragraph (b)(3)(v)(A) of this section, its successor, USS1, are funded members with respect to USS2 Note. Although USS2, a funded member, distributes property (USS1 stock) to its shareholder, FP, pursuant to the reorganization, the distribution of USS1 stock is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section because the stock is distributed in an exempt distribution (as defined in paragraph (g)(10) of this section). In addition, neither USS1's acquisition of the assets of USS2 nor USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section because FP does not receive other property within the meaning of section 356 with respect to its stock in USS2.
