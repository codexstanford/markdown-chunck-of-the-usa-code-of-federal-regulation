######## Example 1.

(1)Partnership has two partners during its 2019 partnership taxable year: P and S. P is a partnership, and S is an S corporation. P has four partners during its 2019 partnership taxable year: A, C, T and DE. A is an individual, C is a C corporation, T is a trust, and DE is a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes. The owner of DE is B, an individual. T has two beneficiaries during its 2019 taxable year: F and G, both individuals. S has 3 shareholders during its 2019 taxable year: H, J, and K, all individuals. For purposes of this section, if Partnership requests modification with respect to A, B, C, F, G, H, J, and K, those persons are all relevant partners (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section). P, S, and DE are not relevant partners (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) because DE is a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes and modification was not requested with respect to P and S.
