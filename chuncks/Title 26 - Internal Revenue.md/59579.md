##### ยง 1.401(l)-5 Overall permitted disparity limits.
###### Introduction,In general.

(a)-(1)The maximum excess allowance and maximum offset allowance limit the disparity that can be provided under a plan for a plan year. The overall permitted disparity rules apply to limit the disparity provided for a plan year if an employee benefits under more than one plan maintained by the employer (the "annual overall permitted disparity limit") and to limit the disparity provided for an employee's total years of service, either in a single plan or in more than one plan of the employer (the "cumulative overall permitted disparity limit"). The overall permitted disparity rules take into account the disparity provided under a section 401(l) plan and the permitted disparity imputed under a plan that satisfies section 401(a)(4) by relying on ยง 1.401(a)(4)-7. A plan that is not a section 401(l) plan is generally deemed to impute permitted disparity under ยง 1.401(a)(4)-7 unless established otherwise. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules on the annual overall permitted disparity limit. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules on the cumulative overall permitted disparity limit.
