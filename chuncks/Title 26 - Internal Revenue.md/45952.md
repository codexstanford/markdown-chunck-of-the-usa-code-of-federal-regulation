####### Change in method of accounting, etc.,In general.,b

(5)-(i)If, in order to comply with an election made under section 1251(b)(4), a taxpayer must change his method of accounting (in computing taxable income from the trade or business of farming) by placing in inventory a class of items not previously treated as in an inventory or by charging to capital account a class of items which had been consistently treated as an expense or as part of inventory (see paragraph (e)(2)(ii)() of ยง 1.446-1), the taxpayer will be deemed to have obtained the consent of the Commissioner as to such change in method of accounting solely as to such items and there shall be taken into account in accordance with section 481 of the Code and the regulations thereunder those adjustments which are determined to be necessary by reason of such change solely as to such items in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. For purposes of section 481(a)(2), such change in method of accounting with respect to only such items shall be treated as a change not initiated by the taxpayer and, thus, under paragraph (a)(2) of ยง 1.481-1, no part of the adjustments required under section 481 with respect to such items shall be based on amounts which are taken into account in computing income (or which should have been taken into account had the new method of accounting been used) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1954, or ending before August 17, 1954.
