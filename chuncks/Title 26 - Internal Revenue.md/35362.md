(B) Under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)()() of this section, FDE is considered to have made the remittance ratably out of all of its accumulated after-tax income, which is deemed to have arisen in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of FDE's assets would be assigned (if CFC1 were a United States person) for purposes of apportioning interest expense under the asset method in Year 2, the taxable year in which FDE made the remittance. Accordingly, $300x ($400x x $750x/$1,000x) of the remittance is deemed made out of the general category tested income of the FDE tested unit, and $100x ($400x x $250x/$1,000x) of the remittance is deemed made out of the passive category FPHCI of the FDE tested unit.
