(B). () The amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section is $80x ($100x section 965(a) inclusion-$70x section 965(c) deduction + $50x section 78 dividends). Not taking into account the $80x creates a net operating loss under section 172 of $60x ($20x taxable income without regard to the section 965(n) election-$80x) for the taxable year (the "deferred amount"). Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the deferred amount of $60x constitutes a net operating loss and is not allowed as a deduction for the taxable year. USP's taxable income for the year is $80x ($100x + $50x + $150x-($280x-$60x)).
