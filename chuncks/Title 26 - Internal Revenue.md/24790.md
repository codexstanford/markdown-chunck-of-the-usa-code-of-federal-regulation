##### taxable year for which items of gross income included
###### § 1.451-3 Timing of income inclusion for taxpayers with an applicable financial statement using an accrual method of accounting.
####### Other items of gross income.

(ii)For all other items of gross income, the taxpayer first compares the cumulative amount of the item of gross income that satisfies the all events test under § 1.451-1(a) through the last day of the taxable year, including the full amount of any advance payment received for such item in a prior taxable year, with the cumulative amount of the item of gross income that is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" under paragraph (b)(2) of this section through the last day of the taxable year and identifies the larger of the two amounts (or, if the two amounts are equal, the equal amount). The taxpayer then reduces such amount by all prior year inclusion amounts attributable to the item of gross income, if any, to determine the AFS income inclusion amount for the current taxable year. If, however, the taxpayer receives an advance payment, as defined in § 1.451-8(a)(1), that is allocable to an item of gross income from a multi-year contract, the taxpayer applies the applicable rules in § 1.451-8, rather than the rules in this paragraph (e)(1)(ii), to determine the amount of the item of gross income that is required to be included in gross income in the taxable year in which such advance payment is received, or, if applicable, in a short taxable year described in § 1.451-8(c)(6).
