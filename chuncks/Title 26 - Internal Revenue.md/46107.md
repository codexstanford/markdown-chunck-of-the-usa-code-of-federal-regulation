####### Special rule for dispositions to certain tax-exempt organizations.

(2)Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to a disposition of natural resource recapture property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) that is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code. The preceding sentence does not apply to a disposition of natural resource recapture property to an organization described in section 511 (a)(2) or (b)(2) (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable, etc., organizations) if, immediately after the disposition, the organization uses the property in an unrelated trade or business as defined in section 513. If any property with respect to which gain is not recognized by reason of the exception of this paragraph (c)(2) ceases to be used in an unrelated trade or business of the organization acquiring the property, that organization is, for purposes of section 1254, treated as having disposed of the property on the date of the cessation.
