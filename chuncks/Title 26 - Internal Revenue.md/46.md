####### Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.

(c)(1) In the case of a husband and wife filing a separate return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the optional tax imposed by section 3 shall be the lesser of the tax shown in-

(i) The table prescribed under section 3 applicable to such taxable year in the case of married persons filing separate returns which applies the percentage standard deduction, or

(ii) The table prescribed under section 3 applicable to such taxable year in the case of married persons filing separate returns which applies the low income allowance.

(2) If the tax of one spouse is determined by the table described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph or if such spouse in computing taxable income uses the percentage standard deduction provided for in section 141(b), then the table described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of the other spouse, if such other spouse elects to pay the optional tax imposed under section 3. Thus, if a husband and wife compute the tax with reference to the standard deduction, one cannot elect to use the percentage standard deduction and the other elect to use the low income allowance. A married individual described in section 141(d)(2) may elect pursuant to such section and the regulations thereunder to pay the tax shown in the table described by subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph in lieu of the tax shown in the table described by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph. See section 141(d) and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the standard deduction in the case of married individuals filing separate returns.
