####### Long-term capital gains.

(f)(1) There is allowed as a deduction in computing accumulated taxable income, the excess of the net long-term capital gain for the taxable year over the net short-term capital loss for such year (determined without regard to the capital loss carryover provided in section 1212) minus the taxes attributable to such excess as provided by section 535(b)(6). The tax attributable to such excess is the difference between:

(i) The taxes (except the accumulated earnings tax) imposed by subtitle A of the Code for such year, and

(ii) The taxes (except the accumulated earnings tax) imposed by subtitle A computed for such year as if taxable income were reduced by the excess of the net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss (including the capital loss carryover to such year)

(2) The application of the rule in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

(3) Section 631(c) (relating to gain or loss in the case of disposal of coal or domestic iron ore) shall have no application in determining the amount of the deduction allowable under section 535(b)(6).
