###### ยง 1.993-3 Definition of export property.
####### c,f,3

(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph (other than () and ()() of subdivision (i) thereof), any relationship between the seller or lessor and any purchaser, subsequent purchaser, lessee, or sublessee is immaterial.

(iii) In no event is the destination test of this subparagraph satisfied with respect to property which is subject to any use (other than a resale or sublease), manufacture, assembly, or other processing (other than packaging) by any person between the time of the sale or lease by such seller or lessor and the delivery or ultimate delivery outside the United States described in this subparagraph.

(iv) If property is located outside the United States at the time it is purchased by a person or leased by a person as lessee, such property may be export property in the hands of such purchaser or lessee only if it is imported into the United States prior to its further sale or lease (including a sublease) outside the United States. Paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section (relating to 50 percent foreign content test) are applicable in determining whether such property is export property. Thus, for example, if such property is not subjected to manufacturing or production (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) within the United States after such importation, it does not qualify as export property.
