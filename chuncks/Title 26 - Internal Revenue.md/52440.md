####### Analysis.

(ii)In 2021, M's contribution of its Q stock to S is an inclusion event under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). The amount includible pursuant to ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $100x (the lesser of the remaining deferred gain of $100x and the fair market value of the qualifying investment of $200x, over S's basis in Q, $0). Because M's contribution of its Q stock to S is not a fully taxable transaction, the general rule in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section applies to treat the contribution as not an intercompany transaction for purposes of applying section 1400Z-2, and ยง 1.1502-13 does not apply to treat M and S as a single entity for purposes of section 1400Z-2. Thus, as a result of the transfer, M takes its $100x of remaining deferred gain into account, M's basis in S is $100x, and S's basis in Q is $100x.
