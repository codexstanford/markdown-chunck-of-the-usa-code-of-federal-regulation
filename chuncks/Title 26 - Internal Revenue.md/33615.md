####### Gross premiums written,In general.

(4)-(i)Gross premiums written are amounts payable for insurance coverage. The label placed on a payment in a contract does not determine whether an amount is a gross premium written. Gross premiums written do not include other items of income described in section 832(b)(1)(C) (for example, charges for providing loss adjustment or claims processing services under administrative services or cost-plus arrangements). Gross premiums written on an insurance contract include all amounts payable for the effective period of the insurance contract. To the extent that amounts paid or payable with respect to an arrangement are not gross premiums written, the insurance company may not treat amounts payable to customers under the applicable portion of such arrangements as losses incurred described in section 832(b)(5).
