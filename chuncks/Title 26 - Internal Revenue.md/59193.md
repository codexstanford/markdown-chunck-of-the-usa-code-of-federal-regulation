###### ยง 1.9000-3 Requirement of statement showing increase in tax liability.
####### Returns filed on or after June 15, 1955.

(b)A taxpayer filing a return on or after June 15, 1955, for a taxable year ending on or before such date, may elect to apply the accounting methods provided in sections 452 and 462. The election may be exercised by either of the following methods:

(1) By computing the tax liability shown on such return as though the provisions of sections 452 and 462 had not been repealed. In such a case, the taxpayer must file on or before December 15, 1955, a statement on Form 2175 showing the increase in tax liability resulting from the repeal of sections 452 and 462.

(2) By computing his tax liability without regard to sections 452 and 462. In this case, Form 2175 must be filed with the return. However, taxable income and the tax liability computed with the application of sections 452 and 462 shall be shown on lines 8 and 14, respectively, of the form in lieu of the amounts otherwise called for on those lines.
