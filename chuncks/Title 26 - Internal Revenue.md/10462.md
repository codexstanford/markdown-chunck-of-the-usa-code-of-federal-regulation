####### Examples.

(9)The application of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(8) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

(iii) M's support from governmental units referred to in section 170(c)(1) and from direct and indirect contributions from the general public (as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section) with respect to the taxable year 2012 normally exceeds 33percent of M's total support ($202,000/$600,000 = 33.67 percent) for the applicable period (2008 through 2012). M meets the 33percent support test with respect to 2012 and is therefore publicly supported for the taxable years 2012 and 2013.
