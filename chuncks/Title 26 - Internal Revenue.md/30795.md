###### ยง 1.642(i)-1 Certain distributions by cemetery perpetual care funds.
####### Certified statement made by cemetery officials to fund trustees.

(d)A trustee of a cemetery perpetual care fund shall not be held personally liable for civil or criminal penalties resulting from false statements on the trust's tax return to the extent that such false statements resulted from the trustee's reliance on a certified statement made by the cemetery specifying the number of interments sold by the cemetery or the amount of the cemetery's expenditures for care and maintenance. The statement must indicate the basis upon which the cemetery determined what portion of its expenditures were made for the care and maintenance of gravesites. The statement must be certified by an officer or employee of the cemetery who has the responsibility to make or account for expenditures for care and maintenance. A copy of this statement shall be retained by the trustee along with the trust's return and shall be made available for inspection upon request by the Secretary. This paragraph does not relieve the care fund trust of its liability to pay the proper amount of tax due and to maintain adequate records to substantiate each of its deductions, including the deduction provided in section 642(i) and this section.
