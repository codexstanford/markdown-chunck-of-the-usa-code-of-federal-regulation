####### Tested loss,In general.

(4)-(i)A United States shareholder's pro rata share of the tested loss of each tested loss CFC for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year is determined under section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e) with the following modifications-

(A) "Tested loss" is substituted for "subpart F income" each place it appears;

(B) For purposes of the hypothetical distribution described in section 951(a)(2)(A) and § 1.951-1(b)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(i), the amount of allocable earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation for a CFC inclusion year is treated as being equal to the tested loss of the tested loss CFC for the CFC inclusion year;

(C) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the hypothetical distribution described in section 951(a)(2)(A) and § 1.951-1(b)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(i) is treated as made solely with respect to the common stock of the tested loss CFC; and

(D) In lieu of applying section 951(a)(2)(B) and § 1.951-1(b)(1)(ii), the United States shareholder's pro rata share of the tested loss allocated to section 958(a) stock of the tested loss CFC is reduced by an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of the tested loss as the part of such year during which such shareholder did not own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) such stock bears to the entire taxable year.
