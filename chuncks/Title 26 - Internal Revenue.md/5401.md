##### Items Specifically Excluded From Gross Income
###### ยง 1.132-9 Qualified transportation fringes.
####### Transit passes.

(b)The working condition and de minimis fringe exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately-operated van pools) are excludable from the partner's gross income if the value of the tokens and farecards in any month does not exceed the dollar amount specified in ยง 1.132-6(d)(1). However, if the value of a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in ยง 1.132-6(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in ยง 1.132-6(d)(1)) is includible in gross income.
