####### Application of general rule.

(ii)Contexts in which the general rule of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section apply include-

(A) The characterization of taxes paid to the United States. A taxpayer described in section 932(c)(1) may take income tax paid to the United States into account under mirrored sections 31, 6315, and 6402(b) as payments to the Virgin Islands;

(B) The determination of the source of income for purposes of the foreign tax credit (for example, mirrored sections 901 through 904). Thus, for example, any item of income that constitutes income from sources within the United States under the rules of sections 861 through 865 will be treated as income from sources within the Virgin Islands for purposes of mirrored section 904;

(C) The eligibility of a corporation to make a subchapter S election (mirrored sections 1361 through 1379). Thus, for example, for purposes of determining whether a corporation created or organized in the United States may make an election under mirrored section 1362(a) to be a subchapter S corporation, it will be treated as a domestic corporation and a shareholder to whom section 932(c) applies will not be treated as a nonresident alien individual with respect to such corporation. While such an election is in effect, the corporation will be treated as a domestic corporation for all purposes of the territorial income tax. For the consistency requirement with respect to entity status elections, see paragraph (h) of this section;

(D) The treatment of items carried over from other taxable years. Thus, for example, if an individual to whom section 932(c) applies has for a taxable year a net operating loss carryback or carryover under mirrored section 172, a foreign tax credit carryback or carryover under mirrored section 904, a business credit carryback or carryover under mirrored section 39, a capital loss carryover under mirrored section 1212, or a charitable contributions carryover under mirrored section 170, the carryback or carryover will be reported on the return filed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, even though the return of the taxpayer for the taxable year giving rise to the carryback or carryover was required to be filed with the United States; and

(E) The treatment of property exchanged for property of a like kind (mirrored section 1031). Thus, for example, if an individual to whom section 932(c) applies exchanges real property located in the United States for real property located in the Virgin Islands, notwithstanding the provisions of mirrored section 1031(h), such exchange may qualify as a like-kind exchange under mirrored section 1031 (provided that all the other requirements of mirrored section 1031 are satisfied).
