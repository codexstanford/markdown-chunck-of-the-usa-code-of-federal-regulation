####### Result.,1

(B)() The year 3 distribution of the TFC stock by UST to USP does not terminate the gain recognition agreement under paragraph (o)(1) of this section because UST does not include the $40x gain in taxable income during year 3. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the year 3 distribution of the TFC stock by UST to USP is generally a triggering event; however, because the distribution is an intercompany transaction that creates an intercompany item, the distribution shall not constitute a triggering event if the conditions of paragraph (k)(12)(i) of this section are satisfied.

(1) The condition of paragraph (k)(12)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied because the aggregate basis of the TFC stock distributed ($50x) is not greater than the sum of the aggregate basis of the TFD stock at the time of the initial transfer ($50x).

(2) The condition of paragraph (k)(12)(i)(B) of this section is satisfied if the next annual certification for the existing gain recognition agreement includes a complete description of the intercompany transaction and an explanation of how the basis condition of paragraph (k)(12)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied.
