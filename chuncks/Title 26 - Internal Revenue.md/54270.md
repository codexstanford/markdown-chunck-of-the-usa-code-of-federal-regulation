####### Result.

(ii)The $100x loss attributable to P's interest in DE1is available to, and in fact does, offset FS's income under the laws of Country X. In addition, under U.S. tax principles, such income is considered to be an item of FS, a foreign corporation. As a result, under ยง 1.1503(d)-3(a), there has been a foreign use of the year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to P's interest in DE1. Therefore, P cannot make a domestic use election with respect to the loss as provided under ยง 1.1503(d)-6(d)(2), and such loss will be subject to the domestic use limitation rule of ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b). The result would be the same even if FS, under Country X tax law, had no income against which the dual consolidated loss of DE1could be offset (unless FS's ability to use the loss under Country X tax law requires an election, and no such election is made).
