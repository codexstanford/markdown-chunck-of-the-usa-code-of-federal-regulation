####### Allocation percentages.

(D)The allocation percentages of the separate interests will be determined based on the relative capital contributions attributable to the qualifying investment and the non-qualifying investment. In the event a partner receives a profits interest in the QOF partnership for services provided to or for the benefit of the QOF partnership, the allocation percentage with respect to the profits interest is based on the share of residual profits the mixed-funds partner would receive with respect to that interest, disregarding any allocation of residual profits for which there is not a reasonable likelihood of application.
