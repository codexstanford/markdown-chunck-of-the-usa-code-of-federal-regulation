####### Analysis.

(B)Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, C's contract with the customer has two performance obligations, and each performance obligation yields a corresponding item of gross income that is accounted for separately. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, C must allocate the $5,000 transaction price amount to each corresponding item of gross income in accordance with the transaction price amount allocated to each respective performance obligation for AFS purposes. Accordingly, C initially allocates $3,750 to the sale of the parts item and $1,250 to the provision of services item. However, because the transaction price was increased by a significant financing component of $1,000, $750 of which was allocated to sale of the parts item and $250 of which was allocated to the provision of services item, pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, C must decrease the transaction price amount allocable to the sale of parts item from $3,750 to $3,000 and must decrease the transaction price allocable to the provision of services from $1,250 to $1,000.
