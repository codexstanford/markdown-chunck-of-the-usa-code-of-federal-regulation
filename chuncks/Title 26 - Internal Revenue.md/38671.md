###### § 1.904(g)-3 Ordering rules for the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and for the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses, and overall domestic losses.
####### Step Five: Recapture of overall foreign loss accounts.

(f)If the taxpayer's separate limitation income for the taxable year (reduced by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section) exceeds the sum of the taxpayer's U.S. source loss and separate limitation losses for the year, so that the taxpayer has separate limitation income remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e) of this section, then the taxpayer recaptures prior year overall foreign losses, if any, in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2, and reduces overall foreign loss accounts in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2. The recapture in this paragraph (f) includes amounts determined under § 1.904(f)-2(c) and (d)(3) but not § 1.904(f)-2(d)(4), which is covered in paragraph (i) of this section.
