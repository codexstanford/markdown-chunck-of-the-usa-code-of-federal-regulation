####### Ordering rules for disallowed business interest expense carryforward.,1,2

(B)Under section 163(j)(2), the $480x of disallowed business interest ($420x + $360x-$300x) is carried forward to the subsequent year. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)() and () of this section, the disallowed business interest carryforward is correspondingly treated first as unrelated business interest expense, and second pro-rata as foreign related business interest expense and domestic related business interest expense. As a result, $420x of the $480x disallowed business interest expense carryforward is treated first as business interest expense paid to Bank and the remaining $60x of the $480x disallowed business interest expense carryforward is treated as interest paid to FP and as an add-back to modified taxable income.
