####### 2,TFC.

()Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to TFC, TFC's assets do not include the stock of LTS. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to TFC, TFC is treated as receiving directly the income of LTS. Because TFC indirectly owns less than 25% of FS, FS is not a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC and, therefore, TFC's assets include the value of TFC's 20% interest in the stock of FS and do not include 20% of FS's assets. Similarly, TFC is treated as if it received $16x (80% x $20x) of the $20x dividend paid from FS to LTS (and not any income of FS). Because the dividend constitutes gross income to LTS (although it is eliminated for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to LTS), TFC is treated as receiving the dividend from FS directly under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. Because the dividend is from a subsidiary that is not a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to eliminate the $16x dividend for purposes of section 1297(a).
