####### Alternate facts.,Example 11

(C)The facts are the same as in paragraph (q)(2)(xi)(A) of this section (the facts in this), except that UST transfers only 90% of the TFC stock to DC. Paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section applies only with respect to the TFC stock transferred to DC. Thus, the conditions of paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section are satisfied if DC enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the TFC stock received from UST. The amount of gain subject to the new gain recognition agreement entered into by DC equals 90% of the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement entered into by UST with respect to the initial transfer. The amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement entered into by UST with respect to the initial transfer is reduced by the amount of gain subject to the new gain recognition agreement entered into by DC. The gain recognition agreement entered into by UST with respect to the initial transfer continues to apply to the remaining TFC stock held by UST.
