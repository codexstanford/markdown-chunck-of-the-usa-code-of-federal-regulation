###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### S purchases Equipment #4 in 2020.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, except that S rather than B purchases and places in service Equipment #4 in 2020. S's purchase of Equipment #4 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement because S had a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 within the lookback period. Thus, S is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #4 in 2020.
