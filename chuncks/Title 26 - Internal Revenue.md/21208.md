###### ยง 1.410(b)-7 Definition of plan and rules governing plan disaggregation and aggregation.
####### Definition of disaggregation population,Plan benefiting employees of qualified separate lines of business.

(ii)-(A)If an employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business for purposes of section 410(b) in accordance with ยง 1.414(r)-1(b), and a plan benefits employees of more than one qualified separate line of business, the employees of each qualified separate line of business are separate disaggregation populations. In this case, the portion of the plan benefiting the employees of each qualified separate line of business is treated as a separate plan maintained by that qualified separate line of business. However, employees of different qualified separate lines of business who are benefiting under a plan that is tested under the special rule for employer-wide plans in ยง 1.414(r)-1(c)(2)(ii) for a plan year are not separate disaggregation populations merely because they are employees of different qualified separate lines of business.
