####### Deduction for worthlessness.

(14)If an eligible taxpayer claims a loss for worthless stock under section 165(g) or otherwise claims a worthlessness deduction with respect to all or a portion of its qualifying investment, then for purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, the eligible taxpayer has an inclusion event and is treated as having disposed of that portion of its qualifying investment on the date it became worthless. Thus, neither section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) or (iv) nor section 1400Z-2(c) applies to that portion of the eligible taxpayer's qualifying investment after the date it became worthless.
