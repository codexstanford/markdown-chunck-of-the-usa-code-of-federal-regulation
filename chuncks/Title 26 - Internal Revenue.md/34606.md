####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the deductible settlement payment is definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income of the type produced by the specific sales of property that gave rise to the damages claims, that is USP's gross income from sales of Product A in Country X. Claims that might arise from damages caused by Product A to customers in the United States are irrelevant in allocating the deduction for the settlement payments made to the customer in Country X. For purposes of determining USP's foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(d), because in 2020 that class of gross income consists of both foreign source foreign branch category income and foreign source general category income, the settlement payment of $60x is apportioned between gross income in the two categories in proportion to the relative amounts of gross income in each category in 2020, the year the deduction is allowed. Therefore, $10x ($60x x $500x/$3,000x) is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income, and the remaining $50x ($60x x $2,500x/$3,000x) is apportioned to foreign source general category income.
