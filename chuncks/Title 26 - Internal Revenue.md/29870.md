###### § 1.585-5 Denial of bad debt reserves for large banks.
####### General rule.

(a)For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, a large bank (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) may not deduct any amount under section 585 or any other section for an addition to a reserve for bad debts. However, for these years, except as provided in § 1.585-7, a large bank may deduct amounts allowed under section 166(a) for specific debts that become worthless in whole or in part. Any large bank that maintained a reserve for bad debts under section 585 for the taxable year immediately preceding its disqualification year (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) must follow the rules prescribed by § 1.585-6 or § 1.585-7 for changing from the reserve method of accounting for bad debts that is allowed by section 585, to the specific charge-off method of accounting for bad debts, in its disqualification year. However, except as may be provided otherwise in regulations prescribed under section 593, the rules prescribed by §§ 1.585-6 and 1.585-7 do not apply to a large bank that maintained a reserve for bad debts under section 593 for the taxable year immediately preceding its disqualification year.
