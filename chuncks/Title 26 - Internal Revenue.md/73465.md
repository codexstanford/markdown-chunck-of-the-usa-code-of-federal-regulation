######## Example 1.

(A)In an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2018 partnership return, the IRS makes a positive adjustment to ordinary income of $100. The $100 adjustment is due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations under section 6662(c), and a 20-percent accuracy-related penalty applies under section 6662(a). The IRS also makes a positive adjustment to long-term capital gain of $300, but no penalty applies with respect to that adjustment. These are the only adjustments. The portion of the imputed underpayment to which the 20-percent penalty applies is $40 ($100 x 40 percent), and the penalty is $8 ($40 x 20 percent).
