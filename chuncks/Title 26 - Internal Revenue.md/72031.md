####### ยง 301.6057-1 Employee retirement benefit plans; identification of participant with deferred vested retirement benefit.
######## Inability to determine correct amount of participant's deferred vested retirement benefit.

(ii)If the amount of a participant's deferred vested retirement benefit which is filed on schedule SSA is computed on the basis of plan records maintained by the plan administrator which-

(A) Are incomplete with respect to the participant's service covered by the plan (as described in subdivision (i)), or

(B) Fail to account for the participant's service not covered by the plan which is relevant to a determination of the participant's deferred vested retirement benefit under the plan (as described in subdivision (i)), then the plan administrator must indicate on schedule SSA that the amount of the deferred vested retirement benefit shown therein may be other than that to which the participant is actually entitled because the amount is based upon incomplete records.
