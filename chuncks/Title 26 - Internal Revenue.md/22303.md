####### Determination period.

(d)The rules under paragraph (a) of this A-11 apply separately to the determination year and the look-back year. Thus, assuming there are no 5-percent owners, if employees A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J are the top 10 highly compensated employees in the 1988 look-back year, and employees F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N and O are the top 10 highly compensated employees in the 1989 determination year, then family aggregation would be required with respect to all fifteen of such employees (i.e. employees A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O).

Q-12: Which individuals are family members for purposes of the aggregation rules in section 414(a)(6)(A) and A-11?
