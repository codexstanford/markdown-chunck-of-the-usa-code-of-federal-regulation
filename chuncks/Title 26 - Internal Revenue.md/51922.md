####### When withholding is applied.

(2)For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, withholding is applied by a withholding agent under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) or chapter 4 (as applicable) when the withholding agent has withheld on the payment and has designated the withholding as having been made under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) or chapter 4 to the extent required in the reporting described in ยง 1.1474-1(c) and (d). For purposes of allowing an offset of withholding and allowing a credit to a withholding agent against its liability for such tax as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, withholding is treated as applied for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section only when the withholding agent has actually withheld on a payment and has not made any adjustment for overwithheld tax applicable to the amount withheld that would otherwise be permitted with respect to the payment.
