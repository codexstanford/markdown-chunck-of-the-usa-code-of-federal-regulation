####### Taxable years must coincide.

(d)The taxable years of all individuals, estates, and trusts under such tax are required to coincide with their taxable years used for purposes of the taxes imposed by chapter 1. Accordingly, when subchapter E begins to apply to a State, a taxpayer whose taxable year for purposes of the Federal income tax is different from his taxable year for purposes of the State income tax which precedes the qualified tax may have one short taxable year for purposes of such State income tax, so that thereafter his taxable years for purposes of the qualified tax will coincide with the Federal taxable year.
