(ii) The amount of such items;

(iii) The cost to the taxpayer of complying with the provisions of section 7872 if such section were applied; and

(iv) Any non-tax reasons for deciding to structure the transaction as a below-market loan rather than a loan with interest at a rate equal to or greater than the applicable Federal rate and a payment by the lender to the borrower.
