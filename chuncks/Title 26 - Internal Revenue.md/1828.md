####### Individual useful life system.

(3)(i) The taxpayer may assign an individual estimated useful life to each asset falling within a guideline class which is placed in service during the taxable year. With respect to the assets falling within the guideline class which are placed in single asset accounts for purposes of computing depreciation, the estimated useful life used for each asset for that purpose shall be used in determining qualified investment. With respect to the assets falling within the guideline class which are placed in multiple asset accounts (including a guideline class account described in Revenue Procedure 62-21) for which a group, classified, or composite rate is used in computing depreciation (or in single asset accounts for which an average life rate is used), the determination of estimated useful life for each asset in the account shall be made individually on the best estimate obtainable on the basis of all the facts and circumstances. The individual estimated useful lives used for all the assets placed in a multiple asset account, when viewed together, must be consistent with the group, classified, or composite life used for the account for purposes of computing depreciation.
