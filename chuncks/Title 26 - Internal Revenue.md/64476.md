() Payments made by agents subject to this paragraph are supplemental wages as defined in ยง 31.3402(g)-1, and are therefore subject to the rules regarding withholding tax on supplemental wages provided in ยง 31.3402(g)-1. For purposes of those rules, unless the agent is also an agent for purposes of withholding tax from the employee's regular wages, the agent may deem tax to have been withheld from regular wages paid to the employee during the calendar year.
