####### Election.

(a)If an election is made under section 4(a) of the Act and if the net increase in tax determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section exceeds $2,500, the taxpayer may also make an election under section 4(b) of the Act prior to September 1, 1960, to pay any portion of such net increase in tax, unpaid on the date of the election, in 2 or more, but not to exceed 10, equal annual installments. If the taxpayer making the election under section 4(a) of the Act is a partnership or a small business corporation electing under Subchapter S, Chapter 1 of the Code, the determination as to whether the net increase in tax exceeds $2,500 shall be made separately as to each partner or shareholder, respectively, with regard to his individual liability. Thus, if a partnership makes an election under section 4(a) of the Act, and partners A and B had a net increase in tax of $3,000 and $2,000, respectively, as a result of dealer reserve income adjustments to partnership income, partner A may elect under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in 2 or more, but not exceeding 10, equal annual installments to the extent that such tax was unpaid on the date of the election. Partner B may not make the election since his net increase in tax does not exceed $2,500.
