####### Preferred stock.

(3)If the remaining adjustment described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section is positive, it is allocated to preferred stock to the extent required (when aggregated with prior allocations to the preferred stock during the period that S is a member of the consolidated group) to reflect distributions described in section 301 (and all other distributions treated as dividends) to which the preferred stock becomes entitled, and arrearages arising, during the period that S is a member of the consolidated group. For this purpose, the preferred stock is treated as entitled to a distribution no later than the time the distribution is taken into account under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., under section 305). If the amount of distributions and arrearages exceeds the positive amount (when aggregated with prior allocations), the positive amount is first allocated among classes of preferred stock to reflect their relative priorities, and the amount allocated to each class is then allocated pro rata within the class. An allocation to a share with respect to arrearages and distributions for the period the share is owned by a nonmember is not reflected in the basis of the share under paragraph (b) of this section. However, if M and S cease to be members of one consolidated group and remain affiliated as members of another consolidated group, M's ownership of S's stock during consolidated return years of the prior group is treated for this purpose as ownership by a member to the extent that the adjustments during the prior consolidated return years are still reflected in the basis of the preferred stock.
