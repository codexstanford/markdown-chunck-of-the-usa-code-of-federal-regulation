####### Discharge

(7)means to release from a hospital facility after the care at issue has been provided, regardless of whether that care has been provided on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Thus, a billing statement for care is considered "post-discharge" if it is provided to an individual after the care has been provided and the individual has left the hospital facility.
