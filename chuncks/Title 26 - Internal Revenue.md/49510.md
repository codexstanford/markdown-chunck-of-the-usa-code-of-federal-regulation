()A beneficial owner withholding certificate is not required to include a foreign TIN (or reasonable explanation for its absence) if the withholding agent has obtained a valid withholding certificate under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or other documentation on which it may rely for purposes of the section 1441 regulations to treat the account holder as a government, an international organization, a foreign central bank of issue, or a resident of a U.S. territory. Thus, for example, a withholding agent may apply the exception provided in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)()() with respect to an account holder claiming exemption under section 892 or otherwise identifying itself as a foreign government on a beneficial owner withholding certificate when the withholding agent may rely upon the claim of exemption under ยง 1.1441-8(b) or the claim of status as a foreign government under ยง 1.1441-7(b)(1) and (2).
