####### iv,Use of inside basis for purposes of C corporation look-through rule.,2,iv,2,i,2,iv,2,i

()This paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)()() applies if a shareholder meets the requirements to look through the stock of a domestic non-consolidated C corporation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)()() of this section, determined without applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a). If this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)()() applies, then solely for purposes of allocating asset basis under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)()() of this section, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, the shareholder may look through to such shareholder's pro rata share of the C corporation's basis in its assets, taking into account the modifications in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section with respect to the C corporation's assets, and adjusted to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section (asset basis look-through approach). If a shareholder applies the asset basis look-through approach, it must do so for all domestic non-consolidated C corporations for which the shareholder is eligible to use this approach, and it must report its use of this approach on the information statement described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section. The shareholder also must continue to use the asset basis look-through approach in all future taxable years in which the shareholder is eligible to use this approach.
