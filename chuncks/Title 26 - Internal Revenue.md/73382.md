###### In General
####### ยง 301.6231(c)-1 Special rules for certain applications for tentative carryback and refund adjustments based on partnership losses, deductions, or credits.
######## Determination of special enforcement area.

(b)In the case of an application under section 6411 described in paragraph (a) of this section, precluding an assessment under section 6225 that would be permitted under section 6213(b)(3) (relating to assessments arising out of tentative carryback or refund adjustments) with respect to any amount applied, credited, or refunded as a result of the application may encourage the proliferation of abusive tax shelter partnerships and make the eventual collection of taxes due more difficult. Consequently, the Secretary hereby determines that such applications present special enforcement considerations within the meaning of section 6231(c)(1)(E).
