(a)-(1)Section 381(c)(13) requires that after the date of distribution or transfer the acquiring corporation, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of applying section 1033, relating to involuntary conversions. This rule shall apply even though the property similar or related in service or use to the property converted, or the stock of a corporation owning such similar property, is purchased by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer and is not received from the distributor or transferor corporation in the transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Accordingly, if any factor essential to the application of section 1033 occurs on or before the date of distribution or transfer and any other such factor also occurs after that date, then, in accordance with section 381(c)(13) and this section, the provisions of section 1033 shall apply to the acquiring corporation in the same manner that they would have applied to the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer. For purposes of this section, the termsandshall have the meaning ascribed to them by the regulations under section 1033.
