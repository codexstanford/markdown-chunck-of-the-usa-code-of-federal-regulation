####### § 1.988-5(a) interim hedge

(ii) A covered modification of one or more contracts that are part of a qualified hedging transaction under § 1.988-5(a) is treated as not legging out of the qualified hedging transaction, provided that, no later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the first covered modification of any such contract, the financial instrument or series or combination of financial instruments that results from any such covered modifications satisfies the requirements to be a § 1.988-5(a) hedge (as defined in § 1.988-5(a)(4)) with respect to the qualifying debt instrument that results from any such covered modification. If a taxpayer enters into a financial instrument intended to mitigate the economic effect of a temporary mismatch of the legs of the qualified hedging transaction during that 90-day period (a), the integration of the § 1.988-5(a) interim hedge with the other components of the qualified hedging transaction during the 90-day period is treated as not legging into a new qualified hedging transaction and the termination of the § 1.988-5(a) interim hedge before the end of the 90-day period is treated as not legging out of the existing qualified hedging transaction.

(iii) A covered modification of one leg of a transaction subject to the hedge accounting rules in § 1.446-4 is not treated as a disposition or termination (within the meaning of § 1.446-4(e)(6)) of either leg of the transaction.

(iv) A covered modification of a qualified hedge or of the tax-advantaged bonds with which the qualified hedge is integrated under § 1.148-4(h)(1) is treated as not terminating the qualified hedge under § 1.148-4(h)(3)(iv)(B), provided that, no later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the first covered modification of either the qualified hedge or the hedged bonds, the qualified hedge that results from any such covered modification satisfies the requirements to be a qualified hedge (determined by applying the special rules for certain modifications of qualified hedges under § 1.148-4(h)(3)(iv)(C)) with respect to the hedged bonds that result from any such covered modification. Solely for purposes of determining whether the qualified hedge that results from a covered modification satisfies the requirements to be a qualified hedge with respect to the hedged bonds that result from any such covered modification in the preceding sentence, a qualified one-time payment with respect to the hedge or the hedged bonds (or both) is allocated in a manner consistent with the allocation of a termination payment for a variable yield issue under § 1.148-4(h)(3)(iv)(H) and treated as a series of periodic payments. This paragraph (c)(1)(iv) does not apply if, prior to any covered modifications, the qualified hedge and the tax-advantaged bond are integrated under § 1.148-4(h)(4).
