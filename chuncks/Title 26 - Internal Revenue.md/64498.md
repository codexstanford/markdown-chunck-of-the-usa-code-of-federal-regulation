(iv) As used in this subparagraph, the term "employee" means an employee within the meaning of paragraph (a) of ยง 31.3401(c)-1, the term "employer" means an employer within the meaning of paragraph (a) of ยง 31.3401(d)-1, and the term "employment" means employment as defined under the usual common law rules.

(v) References in this chapter to wages as defined in section 3401(a) shall be deemed to refer also to supplemental unemployment compensation benefits which are treated under this subparagraph as if they were wages.
