() In addition, if the total replacements of equipment in any single taxable year beginning after December 31, 1968, represents the replacement of a substantial portion of a manufacturing plant which had been in operation before such date, such replacement shall be considered to result in a new plant which was not in operation before such date. Thus, if a substantial portion of a plant which was in existence before January 1, 1969, is subsequently destroyed by fire and such substantial portion is replaced in a taxable year beginning after that date, such replacement property shall not be considered to have been in operation before January 1, 1969. The replacement of a substantial portion of a plant or other property shall be deemed to have occurred if, during a single taxable year, the taxpayer replaces manufacturing or production facilities or equipment which comprises such plant or other property and which has an adjusted basis (determined without regard to the adjustments provided in section 1016(a) (2) and (3)) in excess of 20 percent of the adjusted basis (so determined) of such plant or other property determined as of the first day of such taxable year.
