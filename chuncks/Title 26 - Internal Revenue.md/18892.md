####### 5-percent shareholder

(C) The termincludes any person who is a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation within the meaning of § 1.382-2T(g), without regard to the option attribution rules of section 382(l)(3)(A) or § 1.382-4(d) (or, if applicable, § 1.382-2T(h)(4)).

(D) Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to indebtedness if the loss corporation has actual knowledge immediately after the ownership change that the exercise of an option to acquire or dispose of stock of the loss corporation would cause the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change to be, after the ownership change, either a 5-percent shareholder or a 5-percent entity. An interest that is treated as an option under § 1.382-4(d)(9) (or § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(v) if applicable) is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D).
