() Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, Y Corporation is X Corporation's predecessor. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)() of this section, the lookback period is 2013-2017, plus January through March 2018, to determine if Y Corporation or X Corporation had a depreciable interest in Property that X Corporation acquired on April 1, 2018. Y Corporation did not have a depreciable interest in Property at any time during the lookback period. Because X Corporation had a depreciable interest in Property from 2013 through 2014, X Corporation's acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)() of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
