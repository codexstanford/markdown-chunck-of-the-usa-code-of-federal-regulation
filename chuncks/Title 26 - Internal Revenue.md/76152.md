()If the amount of loans acquired for investment by the association during the preceding taxable year exceeds such amount for the current taxable year, the 15 percent limitation provided in subdivision (iv)() of this subparagraph and the 100 percent limitation provided in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph shall be based upon such preceding taxable year's amount. However, the maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under subdivision (iv)() and the maximum amount of sales of whole loans and participations permitted under subdivision (v) in any taxable year shall be reduced by the amount of the increase in such sales allowed for the preceding taxable year solely by reason of the application of the provisions of the previous sentence. For example, assuming no carryover of sales under subdivision () of this subdivision, if the amount of loans acquired for investment by a calendar year association was $1,000,000 in 1965, under subdivision (iv)() of this subparagraph the association could make sales of whole loans in 1966 of $150,000 (15 percent of $1,000,000) even though the amount of its loans acquired for investment during 1966 was only $800,000. However, the amount of sales of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision (iv)() of this subparagraph would be reduced to the extent that the amount of the sales of whole loans made by the association during 1966 exceeded $120,000 (15 percent of $800,000).
