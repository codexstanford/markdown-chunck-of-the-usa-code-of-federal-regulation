####### Proceeds to political party.

(ii)If a political party may order the disposition of any part of the proceeds of a publication or event described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, such proceeds inure to the use of the party regardless of what the proceeds are to be used for or that their use is restricted to a particular purpose unrelated to the election of specific candidates for public office. Accordingly, where a political party holds a dinner for the purpose of raising funds to be used in a voter registration drive, voter education program, or nonprofit political research program, partisan or nonpartisan, the proceeds are considered to directly or indirectly inure to or for the use of the political party. Proceeds may inure to or for the use of a political party even though they are to be used for purposes which may not be directly related to any particular election (such as to pay office rent for its permanent quarters, salaries to permanent employees, or utilities charges, or to pay the cost of an event such as a dinner or program as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
