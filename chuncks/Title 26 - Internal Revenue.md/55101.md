(ii)-() If an alien individual becomes a citizen or resident of the United States during the taxable year and is a citizen or resident of the United States on the last day of such year, he must make a return on Form 1040 for the taxable year. However, a separate schedule is required to be attached to this return to show the income tax computation for the part of the taxable year during which the alien was neither a citizen nor resident of the United States, unless an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) is in effect for the alien. A Form 1040NR, clearly marked "Statement" across the top, may be used as such a separate schedule.
