###### ยง 1.430(f)-1 Effect of prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance.
####### Requirement to use funding standard carryover balance before prefunding balance.

(2)To the extent that a plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no amount of the plan's prefunding balance may be used to offset the minimum required contribution. Thus, a plan's funding standard carryover balance must be exhausted before the plan's prefunding balance may be applied under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to offset the minimum required contribution.
