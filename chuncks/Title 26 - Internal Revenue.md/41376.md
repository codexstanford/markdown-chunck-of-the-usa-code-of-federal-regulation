###### § 1.960-1 Overview, definitions, and computational rules for determining foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 960(a), (b), and (d).
####### Step 4.

(D)Under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the United States shareholders of CFC1 compute current year taxes deemed paid under section 960(a) and (d) and the rules of § 1.960-2. None of the Country X tax is allocated to CFC1's subpart F income group. Therefore, there are no current year taxes deemed paid by CFC1's United States shareholders with respect to their passive category subpart F inclusions. See § 1.960-2(b)(5) and (c)(7) for examples of the application of section 960(a) and (d) and the rules in § 1.960-2. Additionally, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 960(b)(2) by CFC1 are determined with respect to the section 959(b) distribution from CFC2 under the rules of § 1.960-3. There are no PTEP group taxes associated with the previously taxed earnings and profits distributed by CFC2 in the hands of CFC2. Therefore, there are no foreign income taxes deemed paid by CFC1 under section 960(b)(2) with respect to the section 959(b) distribution from CFC2. See § 1.960-3(e) for examples of the application of section 960(b) and the rules in § 1.960-3.
