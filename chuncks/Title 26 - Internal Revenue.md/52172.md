()The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(J)() of this section, except that P's acquisition of S is not subject to the overlap rule of ยง 1.1502-21(g), and S's net operating loss carryovers are subject to the separate return limitation year (SRLY) rules. See ยง 1.1502-21(c). The application of the SRLY rules depends on S's status as a separate corporation having losses from separate return limitation years. Under paragraph (c)(5), the attribute of S's intercompany item as it relates to S's SRLY limitation is not redetermined, because the SRLY limitation depends on S's special status. Accordingly, S's $30 intercompany gain is included in determining its SRLY limitation for Year 5.
