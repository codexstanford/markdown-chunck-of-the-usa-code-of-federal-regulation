###### ยง 1.414(r)-1 Requirements applicable to qualified separate lines of business.
####### Special rule for employer-wide plans.

(ii)Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, an employer that is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business for purposes of section 410(b) in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section may apply the requirements of section 410(b) on an employer-wide rather than a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis with respect to any plan (within the meaning of ยง 1.414(r)-8(d)(2), but without regard to the mandatory disaggregation rule of ยง 1.410(b)-7(c)(4) for portions of a plan that benefit employees of different qualified separate lines of business) that benefits a group of employees that satisfies the percentage test of section 410(b)(1)(A) (i.e., benefits at least 70 percent of the employer's nonexcludable nonhighly compensated employees). If section 401(a)(4) requires that a group of employees under the plan described in the preceding sentence satisfy section 410(b) for purposes of satisfying section 401(a)(4), the percentage test of section 410(b)(1)(A) must be satisfied by each such group of employees. See ยง 1.414(r)-8(c). The rules of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) are illustrated by the following example.
