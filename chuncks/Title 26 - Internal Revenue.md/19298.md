###### ยง 1.385-4 Treatment of consolidated groups.
####### Partnership owned by a consolidated group.

(6)For purposes of this section and ยง 1.385-3, and notwithstanding the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a partnership that is wholly owned by members of a consolidated group is treated as a partnership. Thus, for example, if members of a consolidated group own all of the interests in a controlled partnership that issues a debt instrument to a member of the consolidated group, such debt instrument would be treated as a consolidated group debt instrument because, under ยง 1.385-3(f)(3)(i), for purposes of this section and ยง 1.385-3, a consolidated group member that is an expanded group partner is treated as the issuer with respect to its share of the debt instrument issued by the partnership.
