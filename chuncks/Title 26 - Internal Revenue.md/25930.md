####### direct ownership interest

(3) The termincludes an interest held as a tenant in common or joint tenant, but does not include stock in a corporation that owns a nuclear power plant or an interest in a partnership that owns a nuclear power plant. Thus, in the case of a partnership that owns a nuclear power plant, the election under section 468A must be made by the partnership and not by the partners. In the case of an unincorporated organization described in ยง 1.761-2(a)(3) that elects under section 761(a) to be excluded from the application of subchapter K, each taxpayer that is a co-owner of the nuclear power plant is eligible to make a separate election under section 468A.
