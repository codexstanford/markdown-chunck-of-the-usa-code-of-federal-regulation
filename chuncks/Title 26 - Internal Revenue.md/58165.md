###### ยง 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapter 1.
####### Multiple valuation misstatements on a return,Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or gross.

(f)-(1)The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return is made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110, and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 100. Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a property-by-property basis, there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property B, but not with respect to property A, even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.
