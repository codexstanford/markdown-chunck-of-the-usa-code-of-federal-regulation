()The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(E)() of this section (), except Taxpayer sells the 100 shares of Company Y common stock on March 10, Year 1, for $11.50 per share. Under section 1092(a)(2)(A)(ii), as in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(E)() of this section (), when the put options are closed out at a loss of $30.00, the basis of each of Taxpayer's shares of Company Y common stock is increased by $0.30 ($30.00/100). Taxpayer has a gain of $120.00 ((100 * $11.50)-(100 * $10.30)) on the sale of the 100 shares of Company Y common stock. Taxpayer has net gain during the taxable year from the identified straddle of $120.00. Under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C) of this section, paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section does not apply to prevent the $120.00 net gain from being eligible gain. As in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(E)() of this section (), under section 1092(a)(2)(A)(iv), Taxpayer may not deduct the $30.00 loss from the put options.
