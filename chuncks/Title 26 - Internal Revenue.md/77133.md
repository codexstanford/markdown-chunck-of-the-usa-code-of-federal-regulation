####### General.

(a)(1) The rate of United States tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code upon dividends derived from sources within the United States on or after January 1, 1952, by a nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien individual, fiduciary, and partnership) who is a resident of France when such dividend is so paid, or by a French corporation, shall not exceed 15 percent if such alien or corporation at no time during the taxable year in which such dividends are so received has no permanent establishment within the United States. Article I(a) of the convention, signed June 22, 1956. As to what constitutes a "permanent establishment" see Protocol III(a), in ยง 514.1.

(2) Thus, if a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of France performs personal services within the United States during the taxable year but has at no time during such year a permanent establishment within the United States, he is entitled to the reduced rate of tax with respect to dividends derived from United States sources, as provided in Article I(d) of the convention even though under the provisions of section 871(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 he has engaged in trade or business within the United States during such year by reason of his having rendered personal services therein.
