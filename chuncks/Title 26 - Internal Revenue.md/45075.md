####### Requirement that obligations be capital assets.

(b)In order for section 1232 to be applicable, an obligation must be a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. See section 1221 and the regulations thereunder. Obligations held by a dealer in securities (except as provided in section 1236) or obligations arising from the sale of inventory or personal services by the holder are not capital assets. However, obligations held by a financial institution, as defined in section 582(c) (relating to treatment of losses and gains on bonds of certain financial institutions) for investment and not primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the financial institution's trade or business, are capital assets. Thus, with respect ot obligations held as capital assets by such a financial institution which are corporate obligations to which section 1232(a)(3) applies, there is ratable inclusion of original issue discount as interest in gross income under paragraph (a) of ยง 1.1232-3A, and gain on a sale or exchange (including retirement) may be subject to ordinary income treatment under section 582(c) and paragraph (a)(1) of ยง 1.1232-3.
