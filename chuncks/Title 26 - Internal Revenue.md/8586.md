####### iii,Partnership assets not properly allocable to a trade or business.,2,i,ii,2,iii

()For purposes of applying paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A)()() and () of this section to a partner that is a C corporation or tax-exempt corporation, such partner's share of a partnership's assets that are not properly allocable to a trade or business is treated as properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business of such partner. However, if the partnership made an election under § 1.163(j)-9(b) or § 1.163(j)-9(h) with respect to an asset or activity, the assets (or assets related to such activities) are treated as properly allocable to an excepted trade or business of such partner. See, for example, an election under § 1.163(j)-9(h) for an asset or an election under § 1.163(j)-9(b) with respect to activities described in § 1.163(j)-9(b)(2)(ii). For a partner other than a C corporation or tax-exempt corporation, a partnership's assets that are not properly allocable to a trade or business are treated as neither excepted nor non-excepted trade or business assets; instead, such partner's adjusted basis in its partnership interest is decreased by that partner's share of the excess of the partnership's basis in those assets over the partnership's debt that is traced to such assets in accordance with § 1.163-8T, and it is increased by that partner's share of the excess of the partnership's debt that is traced to such assets in accordance with § 1.163-8T over the partnership's basis in those assets. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the partnership's asset basis in property not allocable to a trade or business is adjusted pursuant to the rules in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)()(), such partner's share of a partnership's assets is determined under a reasonable method taking into account special allocations under section 704(b).
