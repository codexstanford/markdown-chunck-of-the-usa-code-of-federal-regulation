####### Ratable reduction.

(ii)A reduction is allocated ratably between the 10-percent credit and the additional credit. Thus, for example, if a calendar-year corporation claims a $33,000 investment credit for 1976, including $3,000 additional credit, and $11,000 of the total credit is recaptured in 1978, the $3,000 additional credit is reduced by $1,000. This subdivision (ii) does not apply to a reduction solely of the additional credit as could occur, for example, in the case of a redetermination caused by a mathematical error in computing the additional credit or in the case of a recapture caused by a bad faith failure to comply under paragraph (h) of this section.
