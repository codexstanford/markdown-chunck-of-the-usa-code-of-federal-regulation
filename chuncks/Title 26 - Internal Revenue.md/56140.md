###### ยง 1.6042-2 Returns of information as to dividends paid.
####### Definitions.

(2)The term "person" when used in this section does not include the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, a political subdivision of a State or of a foreign government, or an international organization. Therefore, dividends paid by or to one of these entities need not be reported. For purposes of this section, a person who receives a dividend shall be considered to have received it as a nominee if he is not the actual owner of such dividend and if he was required under ยง 1.6109-1 to furnish his identifying number to the payer of the dividend (or would have been so required if the total of such dividends for the year had been $10 or more), and such number was (or would have been) required to be included on an information return filed by the payer with respect to the dividend. However, a person shall not be considered to be a nominee as to any portion of a dividend which is actually owned by another person whose name is also shown on the information return filed by the payer or nominee with respect to such dividend. Thus, in the case of stock jointly owned by a husband and wife, the husband will not be considered as receiving any portion of a dividend on that stock as a nominee for his wife if his wife's name is included on the information return filed by the payer with respect to the dividend.
