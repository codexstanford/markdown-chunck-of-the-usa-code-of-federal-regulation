######## Depositors' claims against assets.

(a)(1) Claims of depositors, to the extent that they are to be satisfied out of segregated assets, will not be considered in determining the availability of unsegregated assets for tax collection. If depositors have agreed to accept payment out of segregated assets only, collection of tax from unsegregated assets will not diminish the assets available and necessary for payment of the depositors' claims. Thus, it may be possible to collect taxes from the unsegregated assets of a bank although the segregated assets are immune under the section.

(2) If the unsegregated assets of the bank are subject to any portion of the depositors' claims, such unsegregated assets will be within the immunity of the section only to the extent necessary to satisfy the claims to which such assets are subject. Taxes will still be collectible from the unsegregated assets to the extent of the amount by which the total value of such assets exceeds the liability to depositors to be satisfied therefrom. Therefore, if, for example, in the case of a bank having a tax liability, not previously immune under the section, of $50,000, the deposit claims against the bank are in the amount of $75,000, and the assets available for satisfaction of deposit claims amount to $100,000, the $50,000 tax is collectible to the extent of the $25,000 excess of assets over deposit claims. Collection is not to be postponed until the full amount of the tax is collectible.
