####### Recapture.

(C)At the close of Year 2, the amount of the qualified basis is less than the amount of the qualified basis at the close of Year 1, because Unit #6's unsuitability for occupancy prohibits it from being a low-income unit. Unit #6's failure to be a low-income unit results in a credit recapture amount under section 42(j) for Year 2 related to Unit #6. Because Units ##1-5 and 7-10 are all included in the qualified group of units for use in the applicable fraction determination, Units ##1-5 and 7-10 are included in qualified basis for Year 2 when determining the recapture amount.
