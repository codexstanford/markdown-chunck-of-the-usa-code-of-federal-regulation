####### Limited branch defined.

(iii)A limited branch is a branch of an FFI that, under the laws of the jurisdiction that apply with respect to the accounts maintained by the branch, cannot satisfy the conditions of both paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section, but with respect to which the FFI will agree to the conditions of paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section.

(A) With respect to accounts that pursuant to this section the participating FFI is required to treat as U.S. accounts, either report such accounts to the IRS as described in paragraph (d) of this section, close such accounts within a reasonable period of time, or transfer such accounts to a U.S. financial institution, a branch of the FFI that will so report, a participating FFI, or a reporting Model 1 FFI.

(B) With respect to recalcitrant account holders and accounts held by nonparticipating FFIs, withhold with respect to each such account as required under paragraph (b) of this section, block each such account (as defined in this paragraph), close each such account within a reasonable period of time, or transfer each such account to a U.S. financial institution, a branch of the FFI that will so report, a participating FFI, or a reporting Model 1 FFI. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B), an account is a blocked account if the FFI prohibits the account holder from effecting any transactions with respect to an account until such time as the account is closed, transferred, or the account holder provides the documentation described in paragraph (c) of this section for the FFI to determine the U.S. or non-U.S. status of the account and report the account if required under paragraph (d) of this section.
