###### ยง 1.401(a)-4 Optional forms of benefit (before 1994).
####### Exceptions for age, service, employment termination and certain other conditions,Age and service conditions.

(ii)-(A)For purposes of applying paragraph (a)(2) of this Q&A-2, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this Q&A-2, an age condition, a service condition, or both are to be disregarded. For example, an employer that maintains a plan that provides for an early retirement benefit payable as an annuity for employees in division A, subject to a requirement that the employee has attained his or her 55th birthday and has at least twenty years of service with the employer, is to disregard the age and service conditions in determining the group of employees to whom the early retirement annuity benefit is currently available. Thus, the early retirement annuity benefit is treated as currently available to all employees of division A, without regard to their ages or years of service and without regard to whether they could potentially meet the age and service conditions prior to attaining the plan's normal retirement age.
