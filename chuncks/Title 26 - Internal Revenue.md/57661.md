(2)The estimated gross income from farming is the estimated income resulting from oyster farming, the cultivation of the soil, the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities, and the raising of livestock, bees, or poultry. In other words, the requisite gross income must be derived from the operations of a stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, or truck farm, or plantation, ranch, nursery, range, orchard, or oyster bed. If an individual receives for the use of his land income in the form of a share of the crops produced thereon such income is from farming. As to determination of income of farmers, see sections 61 and 162 and the regulations thereunder.
