####### Facts and circumstances.

(ii)The determination of whether a particular separately identifiable item of property is a distinct asset is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account-

(A) Whether the item is customarily sold or acquired as a single unit rather than as a component part of a larger asset;

(B) Whether the item can be separated from a larger asset, and if so, the cost of separating the item from the larger asset;

(C) Whether the item is commonly viewed as serving a useful function independent of a larger asset of which it is a part; and

(D) Whether separating the item from a larger asset of which it is a part impairs the functionality of the larger asset.
