##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### § 1.47-1 Recomputation of credit allowed by section 38.
####### Rules for applying subparagraph (1).

(2)For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph-

(i) In determining whether section 38 property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing the taxpayer's qualified investment, the term "estimated useful life" means the shortest life of the useful life category within which falls the estimated useful life which was assigned to such property under paragraph (e) of § 1.46-3. Thus, section 38 property which is assigned, under paragraph (e) of § 1.46-3, an estimated useful life of 6 years shall not be treated, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, as having been disposed of before the close of its estimated useful life if such property is sold 5 years (that is, the shortest life of the 5 years or more but less than 7 years useful life category) after the date on which it was placed in service. Likewise, section 38 property with an estimated useful life of 15 years which is placed in service on January 1, 1972, shall not be treated as having been disposed of before the close of its estimated useful life if such property is sold at any time after January 1, 1979 (that is, 7 years or more after the date on which it was placed in service).

(ii) In determining the recomputed qualified investment with respect to property which is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property the term "actual useful life" means, except as otherwise provided in this section and §§ 1.47-2 through 1.47-6, the period beginning with the date on which the property was placed in service by the taxpayer and ending with the date of such disposition or cessation. See paragraph (c) of this section.

(iii) In determining the recomputed qualified investment with respect to property which ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer after August 15, 1971, or which becomes public utility property after such date, such property shall be treated as if it were property described in section 50 at the time it was placed in service (whether or not it was property described in section 50 at such time). Thus, if property was placed in service on October 15, 1968, and was assigned an estimated useful life of 4 years, there would be no increase in tax under section 47 if the property were disposed of at any time after October 14, 1971, that is, 3 years or more after the property was placed in service.
