####### Gross income.

(1)For purposes of both the numerator and denominator in the computation of the specified percentages, the term "gross income" has the same meaning as that term has under section 61 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, in determining the gross income requirements under section 856(c) (2), (3), and (4), a loss from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities, real property, etc. does not enter into the computation.
