###### ยง 1.1502-59A Application of section 59A to consolidated groups.
####### Gross receipts exception.

(ii)This paragraph (c)(6)(ii) applies if the original group had insufficient gross receipts to satisfy the gross receipts test under ยง 1.59A-2(d) and thus was not an applicable taxpayer in the year in which the deconsolidating member's disallowed BIE carryforward was incurred. If this paragraph (c)(6)(ii) applies, the deconsolidating member may determine the status of its disallowed BIE carryforward from that year by applying the classification rule of ยง 1.59A-3(c)(4) solely to the interest payments or accruals of the deconsolidating member, rather than by applying ยง 1.1502-59A(c)(3).
