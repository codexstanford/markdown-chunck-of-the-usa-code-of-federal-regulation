####### Analysis.

(B)For Federal income tax purposes, U's treatment of the reward points as a separate performance obligation for AFS purposes yields an item of gross income that must be accounted for separately. The $50 payment allocated to the reward points item is an advance payment as the full inclusion of the payment in gross income in the year of receipt is a permissible method of accounting without regard to this section, a portion of the payment is taken into account as AFS revenue in a subsequent taxable year, and the reward points are redeemable for an item described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this section (goods). Because the entire amount of the $50 advance payment is taken into account as AFS revenue in tax years following the year of receipt, U defers the payment and includes the $50 payment in gross income in 2022.
