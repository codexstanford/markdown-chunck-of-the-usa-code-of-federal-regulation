####### Analysis.

(ii)X treats 50 percent of its $10 of excess business interest expense allocated from PRS in 2019 as ยง 1.163(j)-6(g)(4) business interest expense. Thus, $5 of ยง 1.163(j)-6(g)(4) business interest expense is treated as paid or accrued by X in 2020 and is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at X's level. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section, immediately before the disposition, X increases the basis of its PRS interest from $70 to $95 (add back of $20 of EBIE from 2018 and $5 of remaining EBIE from 2019). Thus, X has a $25 section 741 loss recognized on the sale ($70-$95).
