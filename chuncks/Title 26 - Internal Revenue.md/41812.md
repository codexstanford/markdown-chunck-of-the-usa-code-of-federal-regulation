###### ยง 1.965-2 Adjustments to earnings and profits and basis.
####### 2,CFC2 section 965(a) earnings amount.

()The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC2 is 100u, the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, which is equal to the amount of CFC2's post-1986 earnings and profits of 100u. CFC2's accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is equal to its post-1986 earnings and profits because CFC2 does not have earnings and profits that are attributable to income of the specified foreign corporation that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and subject to tax under chapter 1, or that, if distributed, would be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 or from the gross income of another shareholder if such shareholder were a United States shareholder, and therefore no adjustment is made under section 965(d)(2) or ยง 1.965-1(f)(7). But for ยง 1.965-4(f), CFC2's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, would be 0u, but because the distribution to CFC1 is a specified payment, it is disregarded in determining CFC2's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, under ยง 1.965-4(f).
