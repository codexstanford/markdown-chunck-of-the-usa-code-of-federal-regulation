####### Distribution of replacement QSB stock to a partner that reduces another partner's interest in the replacement QSB stock.

(4)For purposes of this section, a partner must recognize gain upon a distribution of replacement QSB stock to another partner that reduces the partner's share of the replacement QSB stock held by a partnership. The amount of gain that the partner must recognize is determined based on the amount of gain that the partner would recognize upon a sale of the distributed replacement QSB stock for its fair market value on the date of the distribution but not to exceed the amount that was previously not recognized by the partner under section 1045 with respect to the distributed replacement QSB stock. Any gain recognized by a partner whose interest is reduced must be taken into account in determining the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the partnership and also taken into account in determining the partnership's adjusted basis in the QSB stock distributed to another partner under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
