####### Estimated useful life.

(2)The last day of the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant is determined under the following rules:

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section-

(A) The last day of the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant that has been included in rate base for ratemaking purposes in any ratemaking proceeding that established rates for a period before January 1, 2006, is the date used in the first such ratemaking proceeding as the estimated date on which the nuclear power plant will no longer be included in the taxpayer's rate base for ratemaking purposes;

(B) The last day of the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant that is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is the last day of the estimated useful life of the plant determined as of the date it is placed in service;

(C) A taxpayer with an interest in a plant that is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section may use any reasonable method for determining the last day of such estimated useful life; and

(D) A reasonable method for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section may include use of the period for which a public utility commission has included a comparable nuclear power plant in rate base for ratemaking purposes.

(ii) If it can be established that the estimated useful life of the nuclear power plant will end on a date other than the date determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the taxpayer may use such other date as the last day of the estimated useful life but is not required to do so. If the last day of the estimated useful life was determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section and the most recent ratemaking proceeding used an alternative date as the estimated date on which the nuclear power plant will no longer be included rate base, the most recent ratemaking proceeding will generally be treated as establishing such alternative date as the last day of the estimated useful life.

(iii) The estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant determined for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may end on a different date from the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant determined for purposes of ยง 1.468A-8(b)(1) and (c)(1).
