####### Conclusion.,Example 5

(B)The conclusion is the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B) of this section (). Specifically, even though Employee D is an employee of ATEO 5 because Employee D provided more than minor services for ATEO 5, Employee D is disregarded for purposes of determining ATEO 5's five highest-compensated employees for taxable year 2022 under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section because the expense allowance under the accountable plan is excluded from wages within the meaning of section 3401(a), as provided in ยง 31.3401(a)-4, and thus is not remuneration within the meaning of ยง 53.4960-2(a).
