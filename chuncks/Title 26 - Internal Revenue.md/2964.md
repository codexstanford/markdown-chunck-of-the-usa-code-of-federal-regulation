() The amount of the taxes actually imposed

(ii) In the case of organizations subject to the tax imposed by section 511(a), mutual savings banks conducting a life insurance business (see section 594), life insurance companies (as defined in section 801), mutual insurance companies to which part II of subchapter L applies, insurance companies to which part III of subchapter L applies, regulated investment companies subject to tax under part I of subchapter M, real estate investment trusts subject to tax under part II of subchapter M, or any other corporation not subject to the taxes imposed by sections 11 and 1201(a), the capital gains item of tax preference may be computed in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph except that, in lieu of references to section 11, there is to be substituted the section which imposes the tax comparable to the tax imposed by section 11 and, in lieu of references to section 1201(a), there is to be substituted the section which imposes the alternative or special tax applicable to the capital gains of such corporation.

(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, where the net section 1201 gain is not in any event subject to the tax comparable to the normal tax and the surtax under section 11, such as in the case of regulated investment companies subject to tax under subchapter M, such comparable tax shall be computed as if it were applicable to net section 1201 gain to the extent such gain is subject to the tax comparable to the alternative tax under section 1201(a). Thus, in the case of a regulated investment company subject to tax under subchapter M, the tax comparable to the normal tax and the surtax would be the tax computed under section 852(b)(1) determined as if the amount subject to tax under section 852(b)(3) were included in investment company taxable income. The principles of this subdivision (iii) may be illustrated by the following example:

(iv) For the computation of the capital gains item of tax preference in the case of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), see ยง 1.58-4(c).
