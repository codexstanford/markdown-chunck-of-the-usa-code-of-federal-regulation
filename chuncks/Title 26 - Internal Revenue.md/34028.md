(c)-(1)Where a mortgage covers both real property and other property, an apportionment of the interest income must be made for purposes of the 75-percent requirement of section 856(c)(3). For purposes of the 75-percent requirement, the apportionment shall be made as follows:

(i) If the loan value of the real property is equal to or exceeds the amount of the loan, then the entire interest income shall be apportioned to the real property.

(ii) If the amount of the loan exceeds the loan value of the real property, then the interest income apportioned to the real property is an amount equal to the interest income multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the loan value of the real property, and the denominator of which is the amount of the loan. The interest income apportioned to the other property is an amount equal to the excess of the total interest income over the interest income apportioned to the real property.
