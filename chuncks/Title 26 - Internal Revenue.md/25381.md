####### Special rules relating to distributions of certain contracts by a partnership,In general.

(iv)-(A)The constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section apply both to the distribution of a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting by a partnership to a partner and to the distribution of an interest in a partnership (lower-tier partnership) holding (either directly or through other partnerships) one or more contracts accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting by another partnership (upper-tier partnership). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section do not apply to a transfer by a partnership (transferor partnership) of all of its assets and liabilities to a second partnership (transferee partnership) in an exchange described in section 721, followed by a distribution of the interest in the transferee partnership in liquidation of the transferor partnership, under ยง 1.708-1(b)(4) (relating to terminations under section 708(b)(1)(B)) or ยง 1.708-1(c)(3)(i) (relating to certain partnership mergers). If a partnership that holds a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting terminates under section 708(b)(1)(A) because the number of its owners is reduced to one, the entire contract will be treated as being distributed from the partnership for purposes of the constructive completion rules, and the partnership must apply paragraph (k)(2) of this section immediately prior to the transaction or transactions resulting in the termination of the partnership.
