###### ยง 1.963-6 Deficiency distribution.
####### Proof of reasonable cause.

(4)Reasonable cause for failure to receive a minimum distribution shall be deemed to exist, in the absence of circumstances demonstrating bad faith, if the electing United States shareholder receives, within the period prescribed by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of ยง 1.963-3 with respect to the year of election, at least 80 percent of the amount of a minimum distribution (from the earnings and profits to which the election for such year relates) which if received during such period would have satisfied the conditions for the section 963 exclusion to apply to such year. If less than 80 percent of the amount of a minimum distribution is received during such period, the existence of a reasonable cause for failure to receive a minimum distribution must be established by clear and convincing evidence; however, the preceding sentence shall not be taken as a limitation on the establishment of reasonable cause by any other proof of reasonable cause. For example, reasonable cause will exist if a single first-tier corporation for its taxable year makes a distribution which would be a minimum distribution but for a refund of foreign income tax which it has paid in good faith under foreign law but which is found not to be due after the United States income tax return of the United States shareholder has been filed.
