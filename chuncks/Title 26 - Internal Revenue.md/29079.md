()P is a qualified ABLE program described in section 529A and ยง 1.529A-1(b)(14). P receives amounts in order to establish or maintain ABLE accounts, as administrative or maintenance fees and other similar fees including service charges. Because the payment of these amounts is essential to the operation of a qualified ABLE program, the income generated from the activity does not constitute gross income from an unrelated trade or business.
