####### Adoption of taxable year.

(1)Section 706(b) (relating to the adoption of taxable years by partners and partnerships), shall apply to any partnership which adopts or changes to, and any partner who changes to, a taxable year beginning on or after April 2, 1954. For the purpose of applying this subparagraph, the rules of section 708 (relating to the continuation of partnerships) shall apply. For example, if two or more partnerships merge after April 1, 1954, and the new partnership uses the taxable year of the partnership of which it is deemed to be the successor under section 708(b)(2)(A), it will not need prior approval to continue to use such taxable year even though such year may be different from the taxable years of the partners. Such a partnership is not "adopting" or "changing" its taxable year.
