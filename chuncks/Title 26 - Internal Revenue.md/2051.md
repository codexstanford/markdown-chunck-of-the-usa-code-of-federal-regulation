(iii)The stock is part of, or identical to, the existing class of stock having the greatest number of votes per unit of fair market value. For example, assume there are only two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. Their fair market values per share are $1 and $.50, respectively, and the owner of each share of each class is entitled to one vote per share. Thus, Class B has two votes per $1 and Class A has one vote per $1. Accordingly, the Class B stock has the greatest number of votes per unit of fair market value.
