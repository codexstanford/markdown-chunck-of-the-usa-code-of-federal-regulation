####### Funds-available caps,In general.

(v)-(A)A rate is a variable rate if it is a rate that would be described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section except that it is subject to a "funds-available" cap. A funds-available cap is a limit on the amount of interest to be paid on an instrument in any accrual or payment period that is based on the total amount available for the distribution, including both principal and interest received by an issuing entity on some or all of its qualified mortgages as well as amounts held in a reserve fund. The term "funds-available cap" does not, however, include any cap or limit on interest payments used as a device to avoid the standards of paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
