####### Liability described.

(2)The term "liability" includes all liability of an insured in tort, contract, property, or otherwise. It includes, for example, the liability of a principal for the acts of his agent, of a husband for the acts of his spouse, and of a parent for the acts of his child. The term not only includes the direct liability which may be incurred, for example, by a tortfeasor to the person harmed, but also the indirect liability which may be incurred, for example, by a manufacturer to the purchaser at retail for a breach of warranty.
