(6) Trade association dues paid or incurred by a producer of crude oil or gas or a raw mineral product shall be subtracted from the gross income from the property. See subparagraph (4) (iii) of this paragraph for the definition of the termIn addition, a reasonable portion of the trade association dues incurred by a producer of a refined, manufactured, or fabricated product shall also be subtracted from gross income from the property if the activities of the association relate to production, treatment and marketing of the crude oil or gas or raw mineral product. One reasonable method of allocating the trade association dues described in the preceding sentence is an allocation based on the proportion that the direct costs of mining processes and the direct costs of nonmining processes (or in the case of oil and gas, conversion and transportation processes) bear to each other. The foregoing rules shall apply even though one of the principal purposes of an association is to advise, promote, or assist in the production, marketing, or sale of refined, manufactured, or fabricated products. For example, a reasonable portion of the trade association dues paid to an association which promotes the sale of cement, refined petroleum, or copper products shall be subtracted from gross income from the property.
