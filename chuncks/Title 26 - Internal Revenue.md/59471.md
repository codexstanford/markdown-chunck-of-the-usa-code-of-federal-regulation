##### § 1.401(l)-3 Permitted disparity for defined benefit plans.
###### Requirements,In general.

(a)-(1)Disparity in the rates of employer-provided benefits under a defined benefit plan is permitted under section 401(l) and this section for a plan year only if the plan satisfies paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section. A plan that otherwise satisfies this paragraph (a) will not be considered to fail section 401(l) merely because it contains one or more provisions described in § 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(6) (such as multiple formulas). Section 401(a)(5)(D) and § 1.401(a)(5)-1(d) provide other rules under which benefits provided under a defined benefit plan (including defined benefit excess and offset plans) may be limited. See § 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(5)(viii) for special rules under which an insurance contract plan may satisfy § 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2) and section 401(l). See § 1.401(a)(4)-8(c)(3)(iii)(B) for special rules applicable to cash balance plans.
