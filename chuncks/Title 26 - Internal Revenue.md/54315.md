####### Alternative facts.

(v)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(21)(iv) of this section, except that DC is a member of the P consolidated group. Pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-4(d)(2)(iii)(B), the dual consolidated loss of the Country X separate unit is not eliminated and income attributable to the Country X separate unit may continue to be offset by the dual consolidated loss that is succeeded to and taken into account by DC pursuant to section 381, subject to the limitations of ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b) and (c). The result would be the same even if the interest in DE1ceased to be a separate unit in the hands of DC (for example, because it dissolved under Country X law in connection with the transaction), provided P, or another member of the P consolidated group, continued to own a portion of the Country X separate unit.
