###### ยง 1.856-4 Rents from real property.
####### Application.

(ii)In general, the 15-percent test in section 856(d)(1)(C) is applied separately to each lease of real property. However, where the real estate investment trust rents all (or a portion of all) the units in a multiple unit project under substantially similar leases (such as the leasing of apartments in an apartment building or complex to individual tenants), the 15-percent test may be applied with respect to the aggregate rent received or accrued for the taxable year under the similar leases of the property, by using the average of the trust's aggregate adjusted bases of all of the personal property subject to such leases, and the average of the trust's aggregate adjusted bases of all real and personal property subject to such leases. A lease of a furnished apartment is not considered to be substantially similar to a lease of an unfurnished apartment (including an apartment where the trust provides only personal property, such as major appliances, that is commonly provided by a landlord in connection with the rental of unfurnished living quarters).
