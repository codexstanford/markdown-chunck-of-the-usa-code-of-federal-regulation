() For Year 3, the P group again computes separate SRLY limits for each of T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group has consolidated net capital gain (without taking into account a net capital loss carryover deduction) of $30. Under ยง 1.1502-22(c), the aggregate amount of T's $50 capital loss carryover from Year 1 that is included in computing the P group's consolidated net capital gain for all years of the group (in this case, Years 2 and 3) may not exceed $30 (the aggregate consolidated net capital gain computed by reference only to T's items, including losses and deductions actually absorbed (that is, $30 of capital gain in Year 3)). Thus, the P group may include $30 of T's Year 1 capital loss carryover in its computation of consolidated net capital gain for Year 3, which offsets the group's capital gains for Year 3. T carries over its remaining $20 of its Year 1 capital loss to Year 4. Therefore, the capital loss cumulative register of T is decreased by $30, and zero remains in the capital loss cumulative register ($30-$30). Further, because the net operating loss cumulative register includes all taxable income of T included in the P group, as well as all absorbed losses of T (including capital items), a zero net increase occurs in the net operating loss cumulative register. The P group carries over the Year 2 consolidated net capital loss to Year 4.
