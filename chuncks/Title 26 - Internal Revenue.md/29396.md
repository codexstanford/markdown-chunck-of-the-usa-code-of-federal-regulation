###### ยง 1.528-6 Expenditure test.
####### In general.

(a)An organization cannot qualify as a homeowners association under section 528 for a taxable year unless 90 percent or more of its expenditures for such taxable year are qualifying expenditures as defined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The determination of whether an organization meets the provisions of this section shall be made after the close of the organization's taxable year. Investments or transfers of funds to be held to meet future costs shall not be taken into account as expenditures. For example, transfers to a sinking fund account for the replacement of a roof would not be considered an expenditure for the purposes of this section even if the roof is association property. In addition, excess assessments which are either rebated to members or applied against the members' following year's assessments will not be considered an expenditure for the purposes of this section.
