####### Employers of agricultural workers.

(2)Every employer who pays wages for agricultural labor with respect to taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act must make a return for the first calendar year in which the employer pays such wages and for each subsequent calendar year (whether or not wages are paid) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with ยง 31.6011(a)-6. Form 943, "Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees," is the form prescribed for making the annual return required by this section, except that, if the employer's principal place of business is in Puerto Rico, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for Puerto Rico, the return must be made on Form 943-PR, "Planilla para la Declaraci&#xF3;n ANUAL de la Contribuci&#xF3;n Federal del Patrono de Empleados Agr&#xED;colas." However, Form 943 is the form prescribed for making such return in the case of every employer of agricultural workers who is required pursuant to ยง 31.6011(a)-4 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages.
