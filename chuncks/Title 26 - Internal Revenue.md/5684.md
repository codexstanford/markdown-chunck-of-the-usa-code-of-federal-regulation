###### ยง 1.141-13 Refunding issues.
####### Multipurpose issue allocations,In general.

(d)-(1)For purposes of section 141, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, ยง 1.148-9(h) applies to allocations of multipurpose issues (as defined in ยง 1.148-1(b)), including allocations involving the refunding purposes of the issue. An allocation under this paragraph (d) may be made at any time, but once made, may not be changed. An allocation is not reasonable under this paragraph (d) if it achieves more favorable results under section 141 than could be achieved with actual separate issues. Each of the separate issues under the allocation must consist of one or more tax-exempt bonds. Allocations made under this paragraph (d) and ยง 1.148-9(h) must be consistent for purposes of sections 141 and 148.
