####### iii,Sale of Asset A.,2,ii,3,See

()Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the gross income attributable to FDE ($420x) by reason of the sale of Asset A is adjusted downward to the extent that the $500x disregarded payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income that would be attributable to FDE under paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (v) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)()() of this section, the $500x payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE to the extent of the adjusted disregarded gain with respect to Asset A, which is $270x. The source and separate category of the gross income of FDE to which that amount is allocable is proportionate to the source and separate category of the $420x of gain recognized on the regarded sale of Asset A ($378x of foreign source non-passive category income and $42x of foreign source passive category income). Consequently, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)() of this section, in Year 3, gross income attributable to P is adjusted upward by $270x (increasing P's foreign source general category gross income by $243x, which bears the same proportion to $270x as the foreign source non-passive gain ($378x) bears to P's overall gain with respect to Asset A ($420x)), and the foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downward by $270x (with foreign source foreign branch category gross income reduced by $243x). P also has $42x of foreign source passive category income from the sale of Asset A.paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section.
