() Income is to be accumulated and added to corpus until A reaches 21, when he is to receive one-third of the corpus (including accumulations). Thereafter all the income is to be paid to A until he is 23 when the remaining corpus (including accumulations) is to be paid to him. If A dies under that age any undistributed portion is to be paid to B. Distributions to A at 21 and 23 out of accumulations are not accumulation distributions even though they include accumulated income. However, if A died at the age of 22, when B was 23, a distribution to B would be an accumulation distribution to the extent of income accumulations since B reached 21, and the amount of undistributed net income includible in the distribution will not be reduced by the previous distribution to A.
