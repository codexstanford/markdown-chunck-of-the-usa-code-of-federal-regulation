####### Alternative facts.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(17)(i) of this section, except that P owns DE1(rather than DRC) and, in year 1, there is a $100 dual consolidated loss attributable to P's interest in DE1(rather than of DRC). The Country X mirror legislation only applies to Country X dual resident corporations and, therefore, does not apply to losses attributable to P's interest in DE1. As a result, the mirror legislation rule under ยง 1.1503(d)-3(e) would not deny the opportunity of such loss from being put to a foreign use (for example, by offsetting the income of FSthrough the Country X consolidation regime). Therefore, a domestic use election can be made with respect to the dual consolidated loss (provided the conditions for such an election are otherwise satisfied).
