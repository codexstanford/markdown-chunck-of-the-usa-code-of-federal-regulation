###### ยง 1.986(a)-1 Translation of foreign income taxes for purposes of the foreign tax credit.
####### Inflationary currency.,inflationary currency

(iii)Any foreign income taxes denominated in a foreign currency that is an inflationary currency in the section 901 taxpayer's U.S. taxable year to which the foreign income taxes relate, or in any subsequent taxable year up to and including the taxable year in which the taxes are paid, are translated into dollars using the spot rate on the date of payment of such taxes. For purposes of section 986(a)(1)(C) and this paragraph (a)(2)(iii), the termmeans the currency of a country in which there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 30 percent, as determined under the principles of ยง 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D), where the base period, with respect to any taxable year, is the 36 months ending on the last day of such taxable year (in lieu of the base period described in ยง 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D), which ends on the last day of the preceding calendar year). Accrued but unpaid foreign income taxes denominated in a foreign currency that is an inflationary currency in the taxable year accrued are translated into dollars at the spot rate on the last day of the section 901 taxpayer's U.S. taxable year to which such taxes relate (provisional year-end rate). However, a U.S. taxpayer that claims a foreign tax credit under section 901 may choose to translate accrued but unpaid foreign income taxes (including foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 960) denominated in a foreign currency that is an inflationary currency into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment, in lieu of the provisional year-end rate, if such taxes are paid prior to the due date (with extensions) of the original Federal income tax return for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed and such return is timely filed. In all other cases, see ยง 1.905-3 and paragraph (c) of this section for required adjustments upon payment of accrued foreign income taxes denominated in an inflationary currency.
