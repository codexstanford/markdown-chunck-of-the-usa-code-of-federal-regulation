####### Closing conditions.

(ii)If the parties condition a change in a term of a debt instrument on reasonable closing conditions (for example, shareholder, regulatory, or senior creditor approval, or additional financing), a modification occurs on the closing date of the agreement. Thus, if the reasonable closing conditions do not occur so that the change in the term does not become effective, a modification does not occur.
