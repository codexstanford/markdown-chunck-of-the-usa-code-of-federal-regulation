####### Reporting of deduction of taking co-producer.

(B)A taking co-producer deducts the amount of a payment (in cash or property, other than gas produced under the JOA) made to another co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas, but only for the taxable year in which the payment is made. Thus, an accrual method taking co-producer is not permitted a deduction for any obligation it has to pay another co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas until a payment is made. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section for a rule requiring a reduction of the amount of the deduction described in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) if the taking co-producer had mistakenly claimed a depletion deduction relating to those sales.
