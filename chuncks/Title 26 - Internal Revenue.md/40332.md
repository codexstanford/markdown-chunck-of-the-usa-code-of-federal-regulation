()The transfer of the PRS partnership interest is a disqualified transfer of Asset B because it is an indirect transfer of property (other than property described in section 1221(a)(1)) by CFC1; CFC1 and CFC3 are related persons; and the transfer occurs during the disqualified period, the period that begins on January 1, 2018, and ends the last day before the first CFC inclusion year of CFC1 (November 30, 2018). Accordingly, under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the disqualified basis in Asset B immediately after the disqualified transfer is $40x, the excess of CFC3's share of adjusted basis in Asset B immediately after the disqualified transfer ($50x), taking into account the basis adjustment with respect to CFC3 under section 743(b), over CFC1's share of adjusted basis in the property immediately before the transfer ($10x).
