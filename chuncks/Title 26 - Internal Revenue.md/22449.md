###### ยง 1.414(r)-7 Determination of the employees of an employer's qualified separate lines of business.
####### Assignment procedure,In general.

(b)-(1)To apply the provisions listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to a testing year or plan year, as the case may be, each of the employees taken into account under that provision must be assigned to a qualified separate line of business of the employer on one or more testing days (or section 401(a)(26) testing days) during the year. The first day for which this assignment procedure is required for a testing year is the first testing day. See ยง 414(r)-11(b)(6), (7) and (8) (definitions of "testing day", "first testing day" and "section 401(a)(26) testing day"). Section ยง 414(r)-8 may require that the assignment procedure be repeated for testing days that fall after the first testing day (including testing days that fall after the close of the testing year in a plan year that begins in the testing year). Accordingly, new employees may be taken into account for the first time on these later testing days who were not taken into account on the first testing day. Section ยง 414(r)-9 may have the same effect with respect to section 401(a)(26) testing days that fall after the first testing day.
