####### Analysis,Net operating loss allocation.

(ii)-(A)Under paragraph (b) of this section (Step 1), because the total net operating loss for Year 1 of ($1,400x) exceeds total taxable income for Year 2 of $1,300x ($1,200x + $200x - $100x), USC has a partial net operating loss carryover to Year 2 of $1,300x. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, first, the $800x U.S. source component of the net operating loss is allocated to U.S. income for Year 2. The tentative foreign branch category carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section ($200x) does not exceed the remaining net operating loss carryover amount ($500x). Therefore, $200x of the foreign branch category component of the net operating loss is next allocated to the foreign branch category income for Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the remaining $300x of net operating loss carryover ($1300x - $800x - $200x) is carried over proportionally from the remaining net operating loss components in the foreign branch category ($200x, or $400x total foreign branch category loss - $200x foreign branch category loss already allocated) and passive category ($200x). Therefore, $150x ($300x x $200x/$400x) of the remaining net operating loss carryover is carried over from the foreign branch category for Year 1 and combined with the foreign branch category income for Year 2, and $150x ($300x x $200x/$400x) of the remaining net operating loss carryover is carried over from the passive category for Year 1 and combined with the passive category loss for Year 2. After allocation of the net operating loss carryover from Year 1 to the appropriate categories for Year 2, USC has the following taxable income and losses:
