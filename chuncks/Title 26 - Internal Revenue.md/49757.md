####### Withholding responsibility.

(iii)A withholding foreign partnership must assume primary withholding responsibility under both chapters 3 and 4 of the Code to the extent required in the withholding agreement. It is not required to provide information to the withholding agent regarding each partner's distributive share of the payment (including a withholdable payment). The withholding foreign partnership will be responsible for reporting the payments under §§ 1.1461-1(c), 1.1474-1(d), and chapter 61 of the Code and filing Form 1042 (to the extent required in the withholding agreement). A withholding agent making a payment to a withholding foreign partnership is not required to withhold any amount under chapters 3 and 4 of the Code on the payment unless it has actual knowledge or reason to know that the foreign partnership is not acting as a withholding foreign partnership with respect to the payment or has not withheld to the extent required. The withholding foreign partnership shall withhold the payments under the same procedures and at the same time as prescribed for withholding by a U.S. partnership under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that, for purposes of determining the partner's status, the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall apply.
