####### Coordination of section 163(j) with certain other provisions,In general.

(b)-(1)Section 163(j) and the regulations in this part under section 163(j) of the Code generally apply only to business interest expense that would be deductible in the current taxable year without regard to section 163(j). Thus, for example, a taxpayer must apply ยง 1.163-8T, if applicable, to determine which items of interest expense are investment interest under section 163(d) before applying the rules in this section to interest expense. Except as otherwise provided in this section, section 163(j) applies after the application of provisions that subject interest expense to disallowance, deferral, capitalization, or other limitation. For the rules that must be applied in determining whether excess business interest is paid or accrued by a partner, see section 163(j)(4)(B)(ii) and ยง 1.163(j)-6.
