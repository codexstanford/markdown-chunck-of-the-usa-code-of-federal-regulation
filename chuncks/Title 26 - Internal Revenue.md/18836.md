###### § 1.382-6 Allocation of income and loss to periods before and after the change date for purposes of section 382.
####### Coordination with rules relating to the allocation of income under § 1.1502-76(b).

(d)If § 1.1502-76 applies (relating to the taxable year of members of a consolidated group), an allocation of items under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is determined after applying § 1.1502-76. Thus, if a short taxable year under § 1.1502-76 is a change year for which an allocation under this section is to be made, the allocation under this section applies only to the items allocated to that short taxable year under § 1.1502-76.
