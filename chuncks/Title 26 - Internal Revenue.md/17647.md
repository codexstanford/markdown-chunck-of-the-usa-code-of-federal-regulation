####### Example 13. Receipt of boot by the transferee foreign corporation in a subsequent section 351 exchange,Facts.

(xiii)-(A)At the time of the initial transfer, the TFD stock has a $50x basis and $100x fair market value. The amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement is $50x. In year 3, TFC and X, an unrelated foreign corporation, form F1. TFC transfers the TFD stock to F1 in exchange for $35x cash and $65x stock of F1. At the time of the transfer, the TFD stock has a $50x basis and $100x fair market value. The F1 stock received by TFC represents 25% of the outstanding stock of F1. Without regard to the gain recognized under the gain recognition agreement and any adjustments to basis under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, under section 351(b) TFC would recognize $35x gain in connection with the transfer of the TFD stock to F1. UST complies with the conditions of paragraph (k)(3) of this section, and therefore the disposition by TFC of the TFD stock does not constitute a triggering event.
