####### Analysis.

(ii)For purposes of allocating and apportioning USP's $40x of Country A foreign income tax, the $400x of Country A gross income resulting from the sale of FDE is first assigned to separate categories. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, USP's $400x of Country A gross income is assigned among the statutory groupings in the same percentages as the foreign gross income in each grouping that would have resulted if the sale of FDE were treated as an asset sale for Country A tax purposes. Because for Country A tax purposes Asset X had a built-in gain of $150x and Asset Y had a built-in gain of $50x, $300x ($400x x $150x/$200x) of the Country A gross income is assigned to the passive category and $100x ($400x x $50x/$200x) is assigned to the general category. Under paragraph (f) of this section, $30x ($40x x $300x/$400x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the passive category, and $10x ($40x x $100x/$400x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the general category.
