###### ยง 1.614-5 Special rules as to aggregating nonoperating mineral interests.
####### Aggregations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

(6)An application for permission to aggregate nonoperating mineral interests under section 614 (e) and paragraph (d) of this section shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer may have aggregated such interests for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable. If such interests were aggregated for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies and the aggregation was approved by the Internal Revenue Service for such years after full consideration thereof on its merits, such approval will generally be accepted as evidence that avoidance of tax is not a principal purpose of forming the aggregation.
