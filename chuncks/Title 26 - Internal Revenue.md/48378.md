####### Undistributed capital gains.

(C)If section 852(b)(3)(D) or 857(b)(3)(C) (concerning undistributed capital gains) requires the holder of shares in a RIC or REIT to include an amount in the shareholder's long-term capital gains, the rule in paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply to that amount. The 180-day period with respect to the included undistributed capital gain begins, at the shareholder's election, on either the last day of the RIC or REIT's taxable year or the last day of the shareholder's taxable year in which the amount would otherwise be recognized as long-term capital gains by the shareholder.
