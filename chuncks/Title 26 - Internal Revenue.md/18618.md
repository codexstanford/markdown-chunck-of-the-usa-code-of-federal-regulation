###### ยง 1.382-2T Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary).
####### Presumption of no cross-ownership.

(iii)The public owners, 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders and public shareholders in any public group, subject to paragraphs (j)(2)(iii), (k)(2) and (k)(4) of this section, are presumed not to be members of any other public group. It also is presumed that each such person is unrelated to all other shareholders (direct and indirect) of the loss corporation. See paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of this section. The members of a public group that exists by virtue of its direct ownership interest in an entity are presumed not to be members (and not to be related to a member) of any other public group that exists at any time by virtue of its direct ownership interest in any other entity. To the extent that the presumptions adopted in this paragraph (j)(1)(iii) are not applicable because the loss corporation has actual knowledge of facts to the contrary and is thus subject to paragraph (k)(2) of this section, public shareholders, public owners and 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders may be aggregated into additional public groups.
