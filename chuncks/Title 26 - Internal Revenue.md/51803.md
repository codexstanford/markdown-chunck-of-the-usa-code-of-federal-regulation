####### Determination of proportionate interest.

(iv)For purposes of this paragraph (b), and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the determination of a person's proportionate interest in a foreign corporation, partnership, or trust is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. In making this determination, any arrangement that artificially decreases a specified U.S. person's proportionate interest in any such entity will be disregarded in determining whether such person is a substantial U.S. owner. In lieu of applying the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) to determine whether an owner's proportionate interest in a foreign entity meets the 10 percent threshold described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the entity or its withholding agent may opt to treat the owner as a substantial U.S. owner.
