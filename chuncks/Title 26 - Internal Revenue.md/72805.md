######## Example 5.

(v)E was a partner in Partnership during 2018. In 2021, Partnership receives a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) in an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. The FPA reflects an imputed underpayment. Partnership properly elects the application of section 6226 with respect to the imputed underpayment and files with the IRS and furnishes to E a statement of E's share of adjustments with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. E fails to take his share of the adjustments into account in accordance with section 6226. E has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because E has not taken into account his share of adjustments with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year in a manner consistent with how Partnership treated such items on the section 6226 statement filed with the IRS.
