###### Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale.

(b)Pursuant to section 6325(b)(3), a district director may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to any lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Code if part of the property is sold and, pursuant to a written agreement with the district director, the proceeds of the sale are held, as a fund subject to the lien of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property. In order for the provisions of this paragraph to apply, the sale must divest the taxpayer of all right, title, and interest in the property sought to be discharged. Any person desiring a certificate of discharge under this paragraph shall submit an application in writing to the district director responsible for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain such information as the district director may require. Any reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the property and the administration of the sale proceeds shall be paid by the applicant or from the proceeds of the sale before satisfaction of any claims and liens.
