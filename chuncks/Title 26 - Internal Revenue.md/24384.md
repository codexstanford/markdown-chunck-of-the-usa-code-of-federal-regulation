###### § 1.446-4 Hedging transactions.
####### Separate-entity election.

(ii)If a consolidated group makes an election under § 1.1221-2(e)(2), then paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section does not apply. Thus, in that case, each member of the consolidated group must account for its hedging transactions in a manner that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. For example, the income, deduction, gain, or loss from intercompany hedging transactions (as defined in § 1.1221-2(e)(2)(ii)) is taken into account under the timing rules of § 1.446-4 rather than under the timing rules of § 1.1502-13.
