####### Cafeteria style operation.

(18)The term "cafeteria style" operation means a food or beverage operation which is primarily self-service and in which the total cost of food or beverages selected by a customer is paid prior to the customer's being seated or is stated on a check provided to the customer prior to the customer's being seated and is paid by the customer to a cashier. Generally, operations are primarily self-service if food or beverages are ordered or selected by a customer at one location and carried by the customer from such location to the customer's seat. For example, cafeteria lines, buffets, and smorgasbords are primarily self-service. If, after a customer is seated, a food or beverage employee delivers items such as an item that required additional preparation after being selected by the customer, condiments, beverages, or refills at no additional cost to the customer, a food or beverage operation's status as primarily self-service would not be affected.
