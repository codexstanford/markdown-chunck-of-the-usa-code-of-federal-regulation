######## Penalties with respect to partnership adjustments for the reviewed year,In general.

(c)-(1)In accordance with section 6221(a), the applicability of any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts that relate to an adjustment to any partnership-related item for the reviewed year is determined at the partnership level as if the partnership had been an individual subject to tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the reviewed year, and the imputed underpayment were an actual underpayment of tax or understatement for such year. Nothing in this paragraph (c)(1) affects the application of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that may apply to the partnership or to any reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) or to any indirect partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(4)) that is unrelated to an adjustment to a partnership-related item under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code. Except as provided in § 301.6225-2(d), a partner-level defense (as described in § 301.6226-3(d)(3)) may not be raised in a proceeding of the partnership.
