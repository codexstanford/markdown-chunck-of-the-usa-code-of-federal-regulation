(iii)Where a qualified financial institution lends funds to a financial intermediary which are on-lent to a qualified recipient-

(A) The obligation to maintain the documentation described in paragraph (c)(13)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section shall apply only to the financial intermediary and not to the qualified financial institution and the provisions of paragraph (c)(13)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section shall be read so as to impose on the financial intermediary any obligation imposed on the qualified financial institution.

(B) The financial intermediary shall forward annually to the qualified financial institution a copy of the documentation it is required to maintain in its records pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (c)(13)(iii) and shall notify the Assistant Commissioner (International), the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (or his delegate) and the qualified financial institution pursuant to paragraph (c)(14) of this section upon becoming aware that a loan has ceased to be an investment in active business assets or a development project under this section. The qualified financial institution must maintain in its records and have available for inspection the documentation furnished by the financial intermediary pursuant to this paragraph (c)(13)(iii)(B).

(C) The qualified financial institution shall cause one of its officers (or one of the officers of its agent or trustee, if any) to prepare a written report documenting his analysis of the documentation furnished by the financial intermediary pursuant to paragraph (c)(13)(iii)(B) of this section, his discussions, both before and after the disbursement of the loan proceeds, with the financial intermediary's accounting, financial and executive personnel with respect to the proposed and actual use of the loan proceeds, and his analysis of the annual financial statements of the qualified recipient including an analysis of the statement of sources and uses of funds. After the loan disbursement, such discussions and review shall occur annually during the term of the loan. Such report shall include the conclusion that in such officer's opinion there is no reasonable ground for belief that the qualified recipient is improperly utilizing the funds.
