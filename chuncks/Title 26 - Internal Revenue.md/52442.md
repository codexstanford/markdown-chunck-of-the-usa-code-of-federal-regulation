####### Analysis,1,Intercompany sale in 2021.

(B)-()In 2021, S's sale of its Q stock to B is an inclusion event under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). The amount includible pursuant to ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $100x (the lesser of the remaining deferred gain of $100x and the fair market value of the qualifying investment of $250x, over S's basis in Q, $0). As a result of the inclusion, S's basis in its Q stock increases from $0 to $100x and S also realizes a capital gain of $150x ($250x of amount realized less its $100x basis in the Q stock) from the intercompany sale of the Q stock to B. Because S's sale of its Q stock to B is a fully taxable transaction, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section applies to treat the sale as an intercompany transaction. Therefore, S's intercompany gains are taken into account under ยง 1.1502-13(c) and (d). Thus, S defers the inclusion of its $100x of remaining deferred gain and its $150x of capital gain in 2021. B has a $250x basis in its Q stock.
