####### Example 1,Facts.

(i)-(A)In December 2021, A enters into a contract with Customer to manufacture and deliver a good in 2024, with a total contract price of $100x. The costs to produce the good are required to be capitalized under sections 471 and 263A as the good is inventory in the hands of A. On the same day, A receives a payment of $40x from the customer. For its AFS, A reports all of the revenue from the sale of the good as AFS revenue in the year of delivery, which is also the year in which ownership of the good transfers from A to Customer. As of December 31, 2021, A has not incurred any cost to manufacture the good. The payment of $40x does not satisfy the specified good exception in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(H) of this section, and thus qualifies as an advance payment. During 2022, A does not receive any additional payments on the contract and incurs $10x of costs to manufacture the good. A properly capitalizes and allocates such costs to the manufactured good under sections 471 and 263A.
