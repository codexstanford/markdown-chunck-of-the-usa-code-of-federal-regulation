###### § 1.904(f)-4 Recapture of foreign losses out of accumulation distributions from a foreign trust.
####### Effect of recapture on foreign tax credit limitation under section 667(d).

(b)If paragraph (a) of this section is applicable, then in applying the separate limitation (in accordance with section 667(d)(1) (A) and (C)) to determine the amount of foreign taxes deemed distributed under section 666 (b) and (c) that can be credited against the increase in tax in a computation year, a portion of the foreign source taxable income deemed distributed in such computation year shall be treated as United States source income. Such portion shall be determined by multiplying the amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed in the computation year by a fraction. The numerator of this fraction is the balance in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account (after application of §§ 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, and 1.904(f)-6), and the denominator of the fraction is the entire amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed under section 666. However, the numerator of this fraction shall not exceed the denominator of the fraction.
