()If a contribution of property described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)() or () of this section occurs before the covered member acquires control of the controlled member described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)() or before the transaction in which the corporation described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)() becomes a predecessor or successor to the covered member, the contribution of property ceases to be a qualified contribution on the date that the covered member acquires control of the controlled member or on the date of the transaction in which the corporation becomes a predecessor or successor to the covered member (). If the contribution of property occurs within 36 months before the transaction date, the covered member is treated as making a distribution described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section on the transaction date equal to the amount by which any distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section was reduced under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section because the contribution of property was treated as a qualified contribution.
