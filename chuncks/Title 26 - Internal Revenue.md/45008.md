####### Separate-entity election.

(ii)If a consolidated group has made the election under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, then, in addition to the rules of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, the following rules apply:

(A) If an intercompany transaction is identified as a hedging transaction but does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, then, notwithstanding any contrary provision in ยง 1.1502-13, each party to the transaction is subject to the rules of paragraph (g)(1) of this section with respect to the transaction as though it had incorrectly identified its position in the transaction as a hedging transaction.

(B) If a transaction meets the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section but the transaction is not identified as a hedging transaction, each party to the transaction is subject to the rules of paragraph (g)(2) of this section. (Because the transaction is an intercompany hedging transaction, the character and timing rules of ยง 1.1502-13 do not apply. See paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.)
