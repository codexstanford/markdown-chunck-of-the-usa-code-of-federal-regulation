##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### § 1.47-1 Recomputation of credit allowed by section 38.
####### Special rules for progress expenditure property.,i.e.,

(g)Under section 47(a)(3), a recapture determination is required if property ceases to be progress expenditure property (as defined in § 1.46-5(d)). Property ceases to be progress expenditure property if it is sold or otherwise disposed of before it is placed in service. For example, cancellation of the contract for progress expenditure property or abandonment of the project by the taxpayer will be considered a "disposition" within the meaning of § 1.47-2. A cessation occurs if progress expenditure property ceases to be property that will be section 38 property with a useful life of 7 years or more when placed in service. In general, a sale and leaseback is treated as a cessation. However, see paragraph (g)(2) of § 1.47-3 for special rules for certain sale and leaseback transactions. Recapture determinations for progress expenditure property are to be made in a way similar to that provided under §§ 1.47-1 through 1.47-6. Reduction of qualified investment must begin with the most recent credit year (the most recent taxable year the property is taken into account in computing qualified investment under § 1.46-3 or 1.46-5).
