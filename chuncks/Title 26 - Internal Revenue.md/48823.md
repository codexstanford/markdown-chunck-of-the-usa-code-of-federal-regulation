####### Example 3,1,Facts.

(C)-()Entity B meets the explicit requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(1) and has certified itself as a QOF. Entity B owns a commercial golf course that consists of land and other related buildings and equipment in a qualified opportunity zone, and the land and buildings satisfy all explicit requirements (in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)) to be qualified opportunity zone business property. Entity B manages and operates the commercial golf course business, but does not manage or operate any other trade or business not described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (listing businesses not eligible to be a qualified opportunity zone business pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(iii)). Entity B chose to operate the commercial golf course through Entity B, rather than through a qualified opportunity zone business, in order to avoid the requirement in section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(iii), which provides that a qualified opportunity zone business cannot operate a commercial golf course due to the inclusion of that trade or business in section 144(c)(6)(B).
