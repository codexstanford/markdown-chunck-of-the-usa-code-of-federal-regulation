####### Analysis.

(B)Under section 951(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of R for Year 1 is $100x. A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of R is not reduced under section 951(a)(2)(B) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for the dividend of $20x paid to P because there was no part of Year 1 during which A did not own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) the stock of R. Under section 959(b), the $20x distribution from R to P is not again includible in the gross income of A under section 951(a). The $20x distribution from R to P is not includible in the gross tested income of P.
