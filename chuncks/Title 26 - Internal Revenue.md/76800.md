######## Election by corporation.

(2)An election by a corporation pursuant to subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph shall be filed with the district director with whom the corporation was required to file its return of income (see section 6037 of the Code and the regulations thereunder) for the earliest of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966, for which an election terminated under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code. Such election shall be filed within 3 years after the date prescribed by law (not including any extension thereof) on which such return was required to be filed, or within 90 days from February 28, 1967, whichever is later. (However, credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may not be allowed or made if claim therefor has not been filed within the time prescribed by law; and, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph providing that the statutory period for assessment of certain deficiencies against shareholders may not have expired on the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed.) Such election shall be in the form of a statement, signed by a person authorized to sign the corporation's return of income, which shall expressly provide that the corporation elects the application of section 1372(e)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Pub. L. 89-389, with respect to its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966. The statement shall set forth the name, address, and employer identification number of the corporation; the internal revenue officer with whom the corporation's returns of income have been filed for each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; the names and addresses of all persons who have been shareholders of the corporation at any time during each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; computations showing the amount of the corporation's overpayment or deficiency of tax for any taxable year which is attributable to the election under this paragraph; and computations showing each shareholder's portion of the undistributed taxable income (determined as provided in section 1373(b) of the Code) or net operating loss (determined as provided in section 1374(c) of the Code) for each taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, unless such computations were made on the corporation's returns of income for each of such years. In order for an election under this paragraph to be effective, it must be accompanied by the consents of certain shareholders as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
