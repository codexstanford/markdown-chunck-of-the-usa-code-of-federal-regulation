(9)In the event a private foundation is involved in litigation and may not distribute assets or income because of a court order, the private foundation may (except as provided in ยง 53.4942(a)-2 (e)(1)(i) or (ii)) seek and obtain a set-aside for a purpose described in ยง 53.4942(a)-3 (a)(2). The amount to be set aside shall be equal to that portion of the private foundation's distributable amount which is attributable to the assets or income that are held pursuant to court order and which, but for the court order precluding the distribution of such assets or income, would have been distributed. In the event that the litigation encompasses more than one taxable year, the private foundation may seek additional contingent set-asides. Such amounts must actually be distributed by the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the litigation is terminated. Amounts not distributed by the close of the appropriate taxable year shall be treated as described in ยง 53.4942(a)-2 (d)(2)(iii)() for the succeeding taxable year.
