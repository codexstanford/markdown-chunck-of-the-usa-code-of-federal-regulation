####### Payments to an attorney

(4)include payments by check or other method such as cash, wire or electronic transfer. Payment by check to an attorney means a check on which the attorney is named as a sole, joint, or alternative payee. The attorney is the payee on a check written to the attorney's client trust fund. However, the attorney is not a payee when the attorney's name is included on the payee line as "in care of," such as a check written to "client c/o attorney," or if the attorney's name is included on the check in any other manner that does not give the attorney the right to negotiate the check.
