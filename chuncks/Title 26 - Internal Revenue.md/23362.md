###### ยง 1.430(g)-1 Valuation date and valuation of plan assets.
####### Current year contributions made before valuation date.

(2)In the case of a plan with a valuation date that is not the first day of the plan year, for purposes of determining the value of plan assets under paragraph (c) of this section, if an employer makes a contribution for a plan year before that year's valuation date, that contribution (and any interest on the contribution for the period between the contribution date and the valuation date, determined using the effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year) must be subtracted from plan assets in determining the value of plan assets as of the valuation date. If the result of this subtraction is a number less than zero, the value of plan assets as of the valuation date is equal to zero.
