####### Special rules for certain acquisitions of subsidiary stock.

(ii)The following rules apply with respect to a successor described in paragraph (g)(24)(i)(C) of this section:

(A) The seller is a successor to the acquirer only to the extent of the value (adjusted as described in paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(C) of this section) of the expanded group stock acquired from the seller in exchange for property (other than expanded group stock) in the acquisition described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.

(B) A distribution or acquisition by either the seller or a successor seller to or from either the acquirer, the seller, or a successor seller is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section to a covered debt instrument of the acquirer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term successor seller means a member of the expanded group that receives property (other than expanded group stock) in a distribution or acquisition from the seller or another successor seller and is controlled by the acquirer as determined under the principles of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. A successor seller is treated as a successor to the acquirer to the extent of the value of the property received in a distribution or acquisition described in the preceding sentence and, for purposes of applying this paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(B).

(C) To the extent that a covered debt instrument of the acquirer is treated as funding a distribution or acquisition by the seller or successor seller described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, or would be treated but for the exceptions described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the value of the expanded group stock described in paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(A) of this section is reduced by an amount equal to the distribution or acquisition for purposes of any further application of paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to the acquirer and seller.
