####### Consequences of nondiversification,In general.

(a)-(1)Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for purposes of subchapter L, section 72, and section 7702(a), a variable contract (as defined in section 817(d)), other than a pension plan contract (as defined in section 818(a)), which is based on one or more segregated asset accounts shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any calendar quarter period for which the investments of any such account are not adequately diversified. For this purpose, a variable contract shall be treated as based on a segregated asset account for a calendar quarter period if amounts received under the contract (or earnings thereon) are allocated to the segregated asset account at any time during the period. In addition, a variable contract that is not treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period by reason of this paragraph (a)(1) shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any subsequent period even if the investments are adequately diversified for such subsequent period. If a variable contract which is a life insurance or endowment contract under other applicable (e.g., State or foreign) law is not treated as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702(a), the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder is treated as ordinary income received or accrued by the policyholder during such year in accordance with section 7702 (g) and (h). Likewise, if a variable contract is not treated as an annuity contract under section 72, the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder shall be treated as ordinary income received or accrued by the policyholder during such year in the same manner as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702 (g) and (h).
