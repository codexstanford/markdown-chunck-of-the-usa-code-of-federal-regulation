####### Binding written contract.

(i)A written contract is binding only if it is enforceable under State law against both the taxpayer and the party that physically carries out the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide, or a predecessor or successor of either, and does not limit damages to a specified amount (for example, by use of a liquidated damages provision). For this purpose, a contractual provision that limits damages to an amount equal to at least five percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting damages to a specified amount. For additional guidance regarding the definition of a binding written contract, see ยง 1.168(k)-1(b)(4)(ii)(A)-(D).
