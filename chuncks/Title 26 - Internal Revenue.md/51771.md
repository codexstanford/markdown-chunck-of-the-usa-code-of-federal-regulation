####### Contracts producing dividend equivalent payments.

(B)In the case of any contract that results in the payment of a dividend equivalent as defined in section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder (including as part of a termination payment), such contract shall be treated as property that is described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, without regard to whether the taxpayer is a foreign person subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such transaction. To the extent that the proceeds from a termination payment include the payment of a dividend equivalent, the gross amount of such proceeds will not include the amount of such dividend equivalent.
