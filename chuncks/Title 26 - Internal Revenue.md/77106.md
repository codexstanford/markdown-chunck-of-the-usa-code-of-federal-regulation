###### ยง 509.118 Credit against United States tax for Swiss tax.
####### Similar credit requirement.

(2)(i) Article XV(1)(a) further provides that, by virtue of the provisions of Article XV(1)(b) of the convention, relating to the exclusion from basis for computing the Swiss tax, Switzerland satisfies the similar credit requirement set forth in section 901(b)(3), Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to alien residents of the United States, etc.

(ii) This provision of Article XV(1)(a) shall be taken to mean that, solely by reason of the exclusion granted by it under Article XV(1)(b) and without reference to concessions otherwise made by such country, Switzerland satisfies the similar credit requirement only with respect to taxes paid to Switzerland, and not with respect to taxes paid to another foreign country. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed, however, to prevent Switzerland from otherwise satisfying the similar credit requirement, in accordance with section 901 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations thereunder, with respect to taxes paid to another foreign country. Thus, if pursuant to a convention between Switzerland and another foreign country, Switzerland were to exempt from its income taxes the income received from sources within such other foreign country by a United States citizen residing in Switzerland, then Switzerland would, in accordance with such regulations under section 901, satisfy the similar credit requirement of section 901(b)(3) with respect to income taxes paid to such other country by a Swiss citizen residing in the United States.
