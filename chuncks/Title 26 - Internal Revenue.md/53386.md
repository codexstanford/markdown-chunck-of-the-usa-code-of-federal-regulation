####### Analysis,Consolidated tested income and GILTI allocation ratio.

(ii)-(A)USS1 has no aggregate tested income; USS2's aggregate tested income is $200x, its pro rata share (determined under ยง 1.951A-1(d)(2)) of CFC2's tested income; and USS3's aggregate tested income is $600x, its pro rata share (determined under ยง 1.951A-1(d)(2)) of CFC4's tested income. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the P consolidated group's consolidated tested income is $800x ($200x + $600x). As a result, the GILTI allocation ratios of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are 0 ($0/$800x), 0.25 ($200x/$800x), and 0.75 ($600x/$800x), respectively.
