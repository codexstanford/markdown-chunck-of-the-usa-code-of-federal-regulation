####### General method of consolidation,Subgroup method.

(2)-(i)The regulations adopt a subgroup method to determine consolidated taxable income. One subgroup is the group's nonlife companies. The other subgroup is the group's life insurance companies. Initially, the nonlife subgroup computes nonlife consolidated taxable income and the life subgroup computes consolidated LICTI. A subgroup's income may in effect be reduced by a loss of the other subgroup, subject to the limitations in sections 172 and 1503(c). The life subgroup losses consist of life consolidated net operating loss, consolidated operations loss carryovers from taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (consolidated operations loss carryovers), and life consolidated net capital loss. The nonlife subgroup losses consist of nonlife consolidated net operating loss and nonlife consolidated net capital loss. Consolidated taxable income is therefore defined in pertinent part as the sum of nonlife consolidated taxable income and consolidated LICTI, reduced by life subgroup losses and/or nonlife subgroup losses.
