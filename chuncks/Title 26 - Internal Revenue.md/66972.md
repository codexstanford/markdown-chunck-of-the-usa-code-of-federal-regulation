## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter D - Miscellaneous Excise Taxes
#### PART 48 - MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS EXCISE TAXES
##### Subpart M - Special Provisions Applicable to Manufacturers Taxes
###### ยง 48.4216(e)-2 Limitation on aggregate of exclusions and price readjustments.
####### In general.

(a)The sum of the amount excluded from taxable price in respect of charges for local advertising, as provided in section 4216(e)(1) and ยง 48.4216(e)-1, plus the amount of the readjustments for which credits or refunds may be claimed in respect of local advertising, as provided in section 6416(b)(1) and paragraph (c) of ยง 48.6416(b)-1, is subject to an over-all 5 percent limitation. This limitation applies to each manufacturer, as of the close of each calendar quarter, in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 which were sold by such manufacturer in such quarter (and the preceding quarter of quarters, if any, in the calendar year). For example, a manufacturer selling articles taxable under section 4061 (relating to automobiles, trucks, buses, etc.), and also selling articles taxable under section 4111 (relating to refrigerators, quick-freeze units, etc.), who makes separate charges for local advertising in connection with his sales, or who makes reimbursement of local advertising expenses to his vendees out of moneys previously included in taxable price, in respect of any one or more articles in each of the two groups must apply the limitation separately in relation to the articles taxable under section 4061 and in relation to the articles taxable under section 4111. However, in such case, no breakdown of the separate articles taxable under section 4061, or of the separate articles taxable under section 4111, is required.
