###### ยง 1.6042-4 Statements to recipients of dividend payments.
####### Enclosure restrictions.,de minimis

(i)To qualify as a statement mailing, the mailing cannot contain any enclosures except those listed in this paragraph (d)(2)(i). Moreover, no promotional or advertising material is permitted in the mailing of the written statement. Even aamount of promotional or advertising material violates the statement mailing requirement. However, a logo on the envelope containing the written statement and on nontax enclosures described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section does not violate the written statement requirement. The written statement required under section 6042(c) and paragraph (a) of this section may be perforated to a check or to a statement of the recipient-payee's specific account with the payor described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (A) or (C) of this section. The enclosure to which the written statement is perforated must contain, in a bold and conspicuous type, the legend: "Important Tax Return Document Attached." The enclosures permitted in a mailing are limited to-

(A) A check with respect to the account reported on the written statement;

(B) A letter explaining why a check with respect to such account is not enclosed with the written statement (for example, because a dividend has not been declared payable);

(C) A statement of the taxpayer-recipient's specific account with the payor if payments on such account are reflected on the written statement;

(D) A letter limited to an explanation of the tax consequences of the information set forth on the enclosed written statement;

(E) Payee statements related to other Forms 1099, Form 1098, and Form 5498 (or the account balance on a Form 5498), Forms W-2 and W-2G; and
