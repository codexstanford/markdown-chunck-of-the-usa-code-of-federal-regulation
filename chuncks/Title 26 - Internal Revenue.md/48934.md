###### § 1.1402(a)-2 Computation of net earnings from self-employment.
####### Aggregate net earnings.

(c)Where an individual is engaged in more than one trade or business within the meaning of section 1402(c) and § 1.1402(c)-1, his net earnings from self-employment consist of the aggregate of the net income and losses (computed subject to the special rules provided in §§ 1.1402(a)-1 to 1.1402(a)-17 inclusive) of all such trades or businesses carried on by him. Thus, a loss sustained in one trade or business carried on by an individual will operate to offset the income derived by him from another trade or business.
