####### Example.

(ii)L, a calendar-year taxpayer, has an ownership change on December 31, 2021. For 2022, L has taxable income of $300,000 and a regular tax liability of $63,000. L has no pre-change losses, but it has a business credit carryforward from 2020 of $25,000. L has a section 382 limitation for 2022 of $50,000. L's section 383 credit limitation is $10,500, an amount equal to the excess of L's regular tax liability ($63,000) over its regular tax liability calculated by allowing an additional deduction of $50,000 ($52,500). Pursuant to the limitation contained in section 38(c), however, L is entitled to use only $9,500 (($63,000-$25,000) x 25 percent) of its business credit carryforward in 2022. The unabsorbed portion of L's section 382 limitation, $1,000 (computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section), is carried forward under section 382(b)(2). The unused portion of L's business credit carryforward, $14,500, is carried forward to the extent provided in section 39.
