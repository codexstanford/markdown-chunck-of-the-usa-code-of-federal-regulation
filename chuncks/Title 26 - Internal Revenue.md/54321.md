(ii)The $50x dividend is reflected on the books and records of DE3and, therefore, is attributable to P's interest in DE3pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-5(c)(3)(i). In addition, the $25x section 78 gross-up is attributable to P's interest in DE3pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-5(c)(4)(iv). The distribution of $50x from DE3to DE1is generally disregarded for U.S. tax purposes and, therefore, does not give rise to an item that is taken into account for purposes of calculating income or a dual consolidated loss. This is the case even though the item would be reflected on the books and records of DE1. In addition, pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-5(c)(1)(iii), each separate unit must calculate its own income or dual consolidated loss, and each item of income, gain, deduction, and loss must be taken into account only once. As a result, the dual consolidated loss of $75x attributable to P's Country X separate unit in year 1 is not reduced by the amount of dividend income attributable to P's indirect interest in DE3.
