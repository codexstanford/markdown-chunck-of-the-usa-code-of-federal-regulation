() Under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section, the rent received from FP throughout Year 3 is characterized as 100% passive income. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section and section 954(c)(2)(A), the rent received from the unrelated person is characterized as 100% non-passive income. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the 40% of the office building rented to FP has a value of 25% (($100x x 4)/(($100x x 4) + ($300x x 4))) of the value of the office building and that 25% is a passive asset, and the 60% of the office building rented to the unrelated person has a value of 75% (($300x x 4)/(($100x x 4) + ($300x x 4))) of the value of the office building and is a non-passive asset for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC.
