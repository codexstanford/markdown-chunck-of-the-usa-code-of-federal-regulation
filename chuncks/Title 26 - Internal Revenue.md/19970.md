###### ยง 1.401(a)(4)-7 Imputation of permitted disparity.
####### Overall permitted disparity.,Example 4.

(3)The annual overall permitted disparity limits of ยง 1.401(l)-5(b) apply to the employer-provided contributions and benefits for an employee under all plans taken into account under ยง 1.401(l)-5(a)(3). Thus, if an employee who benefits under the plan for the current plan year also benefits under a section 401(l) plan for the plan year ending with or within the current plan year, permitted disparity may not be imputed for that employee for the plan year. See ยง 1.401(l)-5(b)(9),Similarly, if an employee who benefits under the plan for the current plan year also benefits under another plan of the employer for the plan year ending with or within the current plan year, disparity may be imputed for that employee under only one of the plans.
