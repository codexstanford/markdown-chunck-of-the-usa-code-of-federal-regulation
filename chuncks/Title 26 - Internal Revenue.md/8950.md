###### ยง 1.167(a)-7 Accounting for depreciable property.

(a) Depreciable property may be accounted for by treating each individual item as an account, or by combining two or more assets in a single account. Assets may be grouped in an account in a variety of ways. For example, assets similar in kind with approximately the same useful lives may be grouped together. Such an account is commonly known as a group account. Another appropriate grouping might consist of assets segregated according to use without regard to useful life, for example, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, or transportation equipment. Such an account is commonly known as a classified account. A broader grouping, where assets are included in the same account regardless of their character or useful lives, is commonly referred to as a composite account. For example, all the assets used in a business may be included in a single account. Group, classified, or composite accounts may be further broken down on the basis of location, dates of acquisition, cost, character, use, etc.

(b) When group, classified, or composite accounts are used with average useful lives and a normal retirement occurs, the full cost or other basis of the asset retired, unadjusted for depreciation or salvage, shall be removed from the asset account and shall be charged to the depreciation reserve. Amounts representing salvage ordinarily are credited to the depreciation reserve. Where an asset is disposed of for reasons other than normal retirement, the full cost or other basis of the asset shall be removed from the asset account, and the depreciation reserve shall be charged with the depreciation applicable to the retired asset. For rules with respect to losses on normal retirements, see ยง 1.167 (a)-8.

(c) A taxpayer may establish as many accounts for depreciable property as he desires. Depreciation allowances shall be computed separately for each account. Such depreciation preferably should be recorded in a depreciation reserve account; however, in appropriate cases it may be recorded directly in the asset account. Where depreciation reserves are maintained, a separate reserve account shall be maintained for each asset account. The regular books of account or permanent auxiliary records shall show for each account the basis of the property, including adjustments necessary to conform to the requirements of section 1016 and other provisions of law relating to adjustments to basis, and the depreciation allowances for tax purposes. In the event that reserves for book purposes do not correspond with reserves maintained for tax purposes, permanent auxiliary records shall be maintained with the regular books of accounts reconciling the differences in depreciation for tax and book purposes because of different methods of depreciation, bases, rates, salvage, or other factors. Depreciation schedules filed with the income tax return shall show the accumulated reserves computed in accordance with the allowances for income tax purposes.

(d) In classified or composite accounts, the average useful life and rate shall be redetermined whenever additions, retirements, or replacements substantially alter the relative proportion of types of assets in the accounts. See example (2) in paragraph (b) of ยง 1.167(b)-1 for method of determining the depreciation rate for a classified or composite account.
