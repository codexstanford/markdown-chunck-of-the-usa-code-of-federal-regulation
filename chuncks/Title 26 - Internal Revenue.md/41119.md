(B)Because USP indirectly owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) all of the stock of FC2 at the end of Year 1, USP's aggregate tentative section 956 amount with respect to FC2 for Year 1 is $100x, the lesser of USP's pro rata share of the average amounts of United States property held by FC2 ($100x) and its pro rata share of FC2's applicable earnings ($120x). Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, USP's section 956 amount with respect to FC2 for Year 1 is its aggregate tentative section 956 amount with respect to FC2 reduced by the deduction under section 245A that USP would be allowed if USP received an amount equal to its aggregate tentative section 956 amount as a distribution with respect to the FC2 stock that USP owns indirectly within the meaning of section 958(a)(2). For purposes of determining the consequences of this hypothetical distribution, under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A)() of this section, USP is treated as owning the FC2 stock directly. In addition, under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A)() of this section, the holding period requirement of section 246(c) is applied by reference to the period during which USP owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) the stock of FC2. Therefore, with respect to the hypothetical distribution from FC2 to USP, USP would satisfy the holding period requirement under section 246(c) with respect to the 70% of the FC2 stock that USP indirectly owned for three years through FC1, but not with respect to the 30% of the FC2 stock that USP indirectly owned through FC1 for a period of less than 365 days. Accordingly, USP's section 956 amount with respect to FC2 for Year 1 is $30x, its aggregate tentative section 956 amount ($100x) reduced by the amount of the deduction that USP would have been allowed under section 245A with respect to the hypothetical distribution ($70x).
