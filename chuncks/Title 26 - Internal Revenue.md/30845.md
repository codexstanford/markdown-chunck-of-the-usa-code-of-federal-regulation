(d)-(1)For transfers to pooled income funds made after November 30, 1983, for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, the present value of the remainder interest at the time of the transfer of property to the fund is determined by computing the present value (at the time of the transfer) of the life income interest in the transferred property (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and subtracting that value from the fair market value of the transferred property on the valuation date. The present value of a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual is computed by use of Table G in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. For purposes of the computation under this section, the age of an individual is to be taken as the age of the individual at the individual's nearest birthday.
