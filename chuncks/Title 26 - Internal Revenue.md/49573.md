####### Change in circumstances,1,Defined.,1

(D)-()A certificate or documentation becomes invalid from the date of a change in circumstances affecting the correctness of the certificate or documentation to the extent provided in this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D). For purposes of this section, a person is considered to have a change in circumstances only if such change affects the person's claim of chapter 3 status. Thus, for example, a change of address is not a change in circumstances with respect to a claim of only foreign status under this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D) if the change is to another address outside the United States, but is a change in circumstances if the change is to an address in the United States. However, see paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)() of this section for a special rule for a change of address for purposes of reliance on a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for the absence of a foreign TIN) included on a beneficial owner withholding certificate.
