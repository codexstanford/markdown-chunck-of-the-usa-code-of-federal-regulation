####### Employee's request for an early W-2.

(4)If an employee's employment is terminated prior to the end of a calendar year and the employee requests an early W-2 under section 6051 and ยง 31.6051-1(d), a tip allocation under section 6053(c) is not required to be shown on such early W-2. However, the employer may include on such early W-2 the employee's actual tip allocation under section 6053(c), if known, or a good faith estimate of such allocation. A good faith estimate of an allocation shall be signified by placing the word "estimate" next to the allocation on the employee's copy of the early W-2. An amended W-2 must be furnished to each employee to whom an amount is allocated under section 6053(c), during January of the calendar year following the calendar year for which the statement is made, if there is no tip allocation on the early W-2 or if the estimated allocation is found to vary from the actual allocation by more than 5 percent of the amount of the actual allocation.
