####### Result.

(ii)The year 1 dual consolidated loss of DRCoffsets the income of FPunder the laws of Country X. Pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-3(a), the offset constitutes a foreign use because the items constituting such income are considered under U.S. tax principles to be items of a foreign corporation. This is the case even though the United States does not recognize such items as income in year 1. Therefore, DRCcannot make a domestic use election with respect to its year 1 dual consolidated loss pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-6(d)(2). As a result, such loss will be subject to the domestic use limitation rule of ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b).
