###### ยง 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Carryovers.

(ii)The portion of the offsettable nonlife consolidated net operating loss or nonlife consolidated net capital loss that has not been used as a nonlife subgroup loss setoff against consolidated LICTI in the year it arose may be carried over to succeeding taxable years under the principles of ยง 1.1502-21 (relating to net operating loss deduction) or ยง 1.1502-22 (as appropriate) (relating to net capital loss carryovers). However, in any particular succeeding year, the losses will be used under paragraph (f) of this section in computing nonlife consolidated taxable income before being used in that year as a nonlife subgroup loss that sets off consolidated LICTI. Additionally, the amount of consolidated LICTI that may be offset by nonlife consolidated net operating loss carryovers may be subject to limitation (see section 172 and ยง 1.1502-21).
