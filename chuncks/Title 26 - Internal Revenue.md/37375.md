Guarantor receives a profits interest in the partnership that is reasonable in light of Guarantor's management activity. Guarantor has no direct or indirect ownership in PRS assets, and the partnership agreement provides that upon dissolution, PRS assets would be distributed to Fund. Guarantor serves as the general partner of PRS and has discretionary authority to buy and sell PRS assets without approval from Fund. On June 1, 2027, PRS sells the stock in Company A, realizing a gain of $100x.
