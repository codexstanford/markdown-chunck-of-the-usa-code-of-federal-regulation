####### Example 5: Industrial 3D printer and generator.

(5)(i) E owns a building that it uses in its trade or business of manufacturing airplane parts. The building includes an industrial 3D printer that can print airplane wings and an electrical generator that serves the building and the 3D printer in a backup capacity. The 3D printer weighs 12 tons, is designed to remain in place indefinitely once installed in the building, and its removal would be time-consuming and very costly, and would cause significant damage to the building. The 3D printer was installed during the building's construction. The generator also was installed during construction and is designed to remain in place indefinitely once installed. Although costly and time-consuming to remove, removal of the generator will not result in substantial damage to the generator or the building.
