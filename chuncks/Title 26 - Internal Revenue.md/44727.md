###### ยง 1.1082-3 Reduction of basis of property by reason of gain not recognized under section 1081(b).
####### General rule.

(b)(1) Section 1082 (a)(2) sets forth seven categories of property, the basis of which for determining gain or loss shall be reduced in the order stated.

(2) If any of the property in the first category has a basis capable of reduction, the reduction must first be made before applying an amount in reduction of the basis of any property in the second or in a succeeding category, to each of which in turn a similar rule is applied.

(3) In the application of the rule to each category, the amount of the gain not recognized shall be applied to reduce the cost or other basis of all the property in the category as follows: The cost or other basis (at the time immediately after the transfer or, if the property is not then held but is thereafter acquired, at the time of such acquisition) of each unit of property in the first category shall be decreased (but the amount of the decrease shall not be more than the amount of the adjusted basis at such time for determining gain, determined without regard to this section) in an amount equal to such proportion of the unrecognized gain as the adjusted basis (for determining gain, determined without regard to this section) at such time of each unit of property of the taxpayer in that category bears to the aggregate of the adjusted basis (for determining gain, computed without regard to this section) at such time of all the property of the taxpayer in that category. When such adjusted basis of the property in the first category has been thus reduced to zero, a similar rule shall be applied, with respect to the portion of such gain which is unabsorbed in such reduction of the basis of the property in such category, in reducing the basis of the property in the second category. A similar rule with respect to the remaining unabsorbed gain shall be applied in reducing the basis of the property in the next succeeding category.
