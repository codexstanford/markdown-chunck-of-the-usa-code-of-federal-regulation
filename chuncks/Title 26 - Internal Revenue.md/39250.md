####### A-7.

A DISC or former DISC will recognize no income, gain, or loss on a transfer of its qualified assets (as defined in section 993(b)) to a FSC or small FSC if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) The assets transferred were held by the DISC on August 4, 1983, and were transferred by the DISC or former DISC to the FSC or small FSC in a transfer completed before January 1, 1986; and

(ii) The assets are transferred in a transaction which would qualify for nonrecognition under subchapter C of chapter 1 of the Code, or would so qualify but for section 367 of the Code.

In such case, section 367 shall not apply to the transfer.

In addition, other provisions of subchapter C will apply to the transfer, such as section 358 (basis to shareholders), section 362 (basis to corporations), and section 381 (carryovers in corporate acquisitions). In determining whether a transfer by a DISC to a FSC or small FSC qualifies for nonrecognition under subchapter C, a liquidation of the assets of the DISC into a parent corporation followed by a transfer by the parent of those assets to the FSC or small FSC will be treated as a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(D).

Notwithstanding the foregoing answer, a taxpayer which transfers a right to use its corporate name to a FSC in a transaction described in sections 332, 351, 354, 356 and 361 shall not be treated as having sold that right under section 367(d) or as having transferred that right to an entity that is not a corporation under section 367(a) provided that the corporate name is used only by the FSC and is not licensed or otherwise made available to others by the FSC.
