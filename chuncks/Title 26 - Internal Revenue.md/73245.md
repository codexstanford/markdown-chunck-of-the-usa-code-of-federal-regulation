####### ยง 301.6227-3 Adjustments requested in an administrative adjustment request taken into account by reviewed year partners.
######## Example 1.

(i)In 2022, partner A, an individual, received a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section from Partnership with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Both A and Partnership are calendar year taxpayers and A is not claiming any refundable tax credit in 2020. The only adjustment shown on the statement is an increase in ordinary loss. Taking into account the adjustment, A determines that his additional reporting year tax for 2022 (the reporting year) is -$100 (that is, a reduction of $100.) A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 (without regard to any additional reporting year tax) is $150. Applying the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 is reduced to $50 ($150 chapter 1 tax without regard to the additional reporting year tax plus -$100 additional reporting year tax).
