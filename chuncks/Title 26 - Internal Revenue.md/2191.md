####### Application of paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1.

(2)(i) If a taxpayer treats, under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the cost of any used section 38 property which was not originally selected as having been selected in place of the cost of used section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, then, not withstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2 (relating to "disposition" and "cessation"), paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph to the extent of the cost of the newly selected used section 38 property.

(ii) If the cost of the used section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph exceeds the cost of the newly selected used section 38 property, then the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall cease to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer to the extent of such excess.

(iii) If the newly selected used section 38 property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of the estimated useful life of the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, then, unless he reselects other used section 38 property, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall apply with respect to such newly selected used section 38 property. For purposes of recomputing qualified investment with respect to such newly selected used section 38 property the actual useful life shall be deemed to be the period beginning with the date on which the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph was placed in service by the taxpayer and ending with the date of the disposition or cessation with respect to such newly selected used section 38 property. See paragraph (c) of § 1.47-1, relating to date placed in service and date of disposition or cessation.
