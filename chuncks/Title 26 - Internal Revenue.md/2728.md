####### Treatment of successor-employers.

(h)In the case of a successor-employer referred to in section 3306(b)(1), the determination of the amount of credit under this section with respect to wages paid by such successor-employer shall be made in the same manner as if such wages were paid by the predecessor-employer referred to in such section. Thus, the 1-year period referred to in ยง 1.51-1(b)(2)(i) will be considered to begin with the day the employee first began work for the transferor-employer, and the amount of qualified first-year wages and qualified second-year wages paid or incurred with respect to the employee must be reduced by the amount of any such wages paid or incurred by the transferor-employer. (See examples 10 and 11 in paragraph (j) of this section.) Also, see paragraph (d)(10) of this section for rules concerning the viability of the employee's certification.
