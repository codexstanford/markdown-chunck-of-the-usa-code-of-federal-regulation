####### Partner-level allocations.

(iii)Because PRS is not subject to section 163(j) by reason of section 163(j)(3), PRS's $40 of business interest expense does not retain its character as business interest expense for purposes of section 163(j). As a result, such business interest expense is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the level of either the partnership or partner. Additionally, pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-6(m)(1), each partner includes its share of non-excepted trade or business items of income, gain, loss, and deduction (including business interest expense and business interest income) of PRS when calculating its ATI. As a result, X and Y each increase their ATI by $35.60. Further, because PRS is not subject to section 163(j) by reason of section 163(j)(3), the excess business interest expense from Year 1 is treated as paid or accrued by the partners pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-6(m)(3). As a result, X and Y each treat their $5 of excess business interest expense from Year 1 as paid or accrued in Year 2, and increase their business interest expense by $5.
