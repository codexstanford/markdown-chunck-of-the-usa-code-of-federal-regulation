####### Secured indebtedness defined.

(ii)An indebtedness to the seller is secured by the real property for purposes of this section whenever the seller has the right to take title or possession of the property or both if there is a default with respect to such indebtedness. A sale of real property may give rise to an indebtedness to the seller although the seller is limited in his recourse to the property for payment of the indebtedness in the case of a default.
