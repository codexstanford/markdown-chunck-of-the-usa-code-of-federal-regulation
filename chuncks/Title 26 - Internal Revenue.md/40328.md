()The transfer of Asset A is a disqualified transfer of Asset A because it is a transfer of property (other than property described in section 1221(a)(1)) by CFC1; CFC1 and CFC2 are related persons; and the transfer occurs during the disqualified period, the period that begins on January 1, 2018, and ends the last day before the first CFC inclusion year of CFC1 (November 30, 2018). Accordingly, under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the disqualified basis in Asset A immediately after the disqualified transfer is $60x, the excess of CFC2's adjusted basis in Asset A immediately after the disqualified transfer ($100x), over the sum of CFC1's adjusted basis in Asset A immediately before the transfer ($10x) and USP's pro rata share of the gain recognized by CFC1 on the transfer of the property taken into account by USP under section 951(a)(1)(A) ($30x).
