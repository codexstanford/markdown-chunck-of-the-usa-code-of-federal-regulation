##### information returns
###### ยง 1.6049-4 Return of information as to interest paid and original issue discount includible in gross income after December 31, 1982.
####### Transaction defined.

(4)For purposes of this paragraph (e), a transaction means a payment at one time on one or more obligations. For example, if an individual who is exempt from withholding under section 3406 presents at one time five Series EE bonds on each of which $3 of interest has accrued, $15 of interest will be paid as part of the transaction. Accordingly, an information return is required under ยง 1.6049-4 (a)(2)(iii) because the interest paid in the transaction exceeds $10. If only three of the savings bonds were presented, however, no return would be required even if the remaining two bonds were redeemed the following day. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the requirement that an information return be made if any amount of tax is withheld under section 3406.
