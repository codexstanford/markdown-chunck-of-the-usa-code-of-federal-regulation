####### Assets held by eligible funds.

(ii)For purposes of paragraph (e)(13)(i) of this section, an identifiable pool of assets of an eligible fund is treated as maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients, and hence as a qualified segregated account, only if the terms applicable to the eligible fund or the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates require that all the assets in the pool, and all the income earned with respect to such assets, be used exclusively to fund the provision of qualified benefits to qualified recipients or to satisfy necessary reasonable expenses of the eligible fund, and that such assets or income may not inure to the benefit of a person other than a qualified recipient. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(13)(ii), the fact that assets or income may inure to the benefit of a governmental unit by operation of escheat or similar laws, or may revert (such as upon plan termination or dissolution (after all obligations to qualified recipients and creditors have been satisfied) or the qualified recipients' benefits failing to vest) to the governmental unit or employer in accordance with applicable foreign law is ignored, so long as contributions to the plan are not more than reasonably necessary to fund the qualified benefits to be provided to qualified recipients.
