####### Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate of a QI that assumes primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3.

(D)A QI that assumes primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 for a payment may not make an election to be withheld upon, as described in ยง 1.1471-2(a)(2)(iii), with respect to that payment. Thus, if a QI assumes primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, in addition to the other requirements described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a valid withholding certificate only when the QI has also indicated on the intermediary withholding certificate that it will assume primary withholding responsibility for that payment for purposes of chapter 4.
