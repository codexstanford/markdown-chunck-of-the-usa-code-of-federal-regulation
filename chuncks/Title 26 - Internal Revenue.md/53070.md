####### 2,Allocation and application of attribute reduction amount not applied to lower-tier subsidiary stock.,2

()Any portion of S's attribute reduction amount not applied to reduce S's Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes and not allocated to lower-tier subsidiary stock is allocated to S's Category D assets other than lower-tier subsidiary stock in the manner provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B)(). Such amount is first allocated to S's bases (if any) in its assets identified as Class VII assets in ยง 1.338-6(b)(2)(vii). If the attribute reduction amount allocated to Class VII assets is less than S's aggregate basis in those assets, it is applied proportionately (by basis) to reduce the bases of such assets. If the attribute reduction amount allocated to Class VII assets equals or exceeds S's aggregate basis in those assets, it is applied to reduce the bases of such assets to zero. Any remaining attribute reduction amount is then allocated and applied in the same manner to reduce S's bases (if any) in assets identified as Class VI assets in ยง 1.338-6(b)(2)(vi), and then to reduce S's bases (if any) in its assets identified in ยง 1.338-6(b)(2) as Class V, Class IV, Class III, and Class II, successively.
