####### Types of determinations.

(8)For purposes of this paragraph-

(i) The term "inconsistent" refers to a determination that is inconsistent with section 46(f) (1) or (2) (as the case may be). Thus, for example, a determination to reduce the taxpayer's cost of service by more than a ratable portion of the credit would be a determination that is inconsistent with section 46(f)(2). As a further example, such a determination would also be inconsistent if section 46(f)(1) applied because no reduction in cost of service is permitted under section 46(f)(1).

(ii) The term "consistent" refers to a determination that is consistent with section 46(f) (1) or (2) (as the case may be).

(iii) The term "final determination" means a determination with respect to which all rights to appeal or to request a review, a rehearing, or a redetermination have been exhausted or have lapsed.

(iv) The term "first final inconsistent determination" means the first final determination put into effect after December 10, 1971, that is inconsistent with section 46(f) (1) or (2) (as the case may be).
