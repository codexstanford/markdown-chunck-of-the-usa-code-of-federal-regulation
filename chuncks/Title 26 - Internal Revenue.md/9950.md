() Because the father and his son are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and ยง 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of December 15, 2019, the son's acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, the son's acquisition of the machine is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
