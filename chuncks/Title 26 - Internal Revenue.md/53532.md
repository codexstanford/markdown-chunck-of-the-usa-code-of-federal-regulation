###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Analysis.

(ii)B's acquisition of Equipment #3 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement as a result of the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule. In a series of related transactions, G became a member of the Parent group and B acquired Equipment #3. Because G had a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period, B is treated as having a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 under the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule. Thus, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #3 in 2019.
