####### Inclusion of S's remaining deferred gain in 2026.

(D)B continues to own the Q stock through 2026, and, treating S and B as divisions of a single entity for purposes of section 1400Z-2, the single entity would include its remaining deferred gain in income on December 31, 2026. See section 1400Z-2(b)(1), ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(b). On a single-entity basis, the amount includible pursuant to ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $85x (the lesser of the remaining deferred gain of $100x and the fair market value of the qualifying investment of $300x, over the single entity's basis in Q, $15x). B does not otherwise have an income event with respect to its Q stock in 2026. Therefore, under ยง 1.1502-13(c), all $85x of S's remaining deferred gain is taken into account in 2026. In addition, S's $150x of capital gain on its Q stock sale continues to be deferred, and B's basis in Q remains $250x.
