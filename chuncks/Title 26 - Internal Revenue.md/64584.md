###### ยง 31.3402(c)-1 Wage bracket withholding.
####### Period or elapsed time less than 1 week.

(d)(1) It is the general rule that if wages are paid for a payroll period or other period of less than 1 week, the tax to be deducted and withheld under the wage bracket method shall be the amount computed for a daily payroll period, or for a miscellaneous payroll period containing the same number of days (including Sundays and holidays) as the payroll period, or other period, for which such wages are paid. In the case of wages paid without regard to any period, if the elapsed time computed as provided in paragraph (c) of this section is less than 1 week, the same rule is applicable.

(2) If the payroll period, other period or elapsed time where wages are paid without regard to any period, is less than one week, the employer may, under certain conditions, elect to deduct and withhold the tax determined by the application of the wage table for a weekly payroll period to the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week. The election to use the weekly wage table in such cases is subject to the limitations and conditions prescribed in Circular E with respect to employers using the percentage method in similar cases.

(3) As used in this paragraph the term "calendar week" means a period of seven consecutive days beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday.
