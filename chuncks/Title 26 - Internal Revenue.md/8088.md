####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (b) of this section, all of X's interest expense is considered business interest expense, all of X's interest income is considered business interest income, and all of X's other income is considered to be properly allocable to a trade or business. Because X's $50x of business interest income exceeds the $20x of business interest expense from the 2022 taxable year and the $7x of disallowed business interest expense carryforward from the 2021 taxable year, X may deduct $27x of business interest expense in the 2022 taxable year. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, X must reduce its current earnings and profits for the 2022 taxable year by the full amount of the deductible business interest expense ($27x).
