####### Large food or beverage establishment.

(7)A food or beverage operation is a "large food or beverage establishment" if:

(i) The employer at the food or beverage operation normally employed more than 10 employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year, and

(ii) The tipping of food or beverage employees of the food or beverage operation is customary. Generally, tipping would not be considered customary for a cafeteria style operation (as defined in paragraph (j)(18) of this section) or for a food or beverage operation where at least 95 percent of its total sales are nonallocable receipts, within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3) of this section, by reason of the addition of a service charge of 10 percent or more. Total sales shall include only gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) and nonallocable receipts (other than carryout receipts) from the provision of food or beverages. In the case of an operation such as a restaurant that is a cafeteria style operation at lunch and that has full service with tipping customary at dinner, the entire operation is generally a large food or beverage establishment if the employer meets the 10-employee test. However, if the gross receipts of the cafeteria style operation at lunch are recorded separately from the dinner operation gross receipts the employer may treat the dinner operation as a large food or beverage establishment and the lunch operation as a separate food or beverage operation that is not a large food or beverage establishment due to the fact that tipping is not considered customary for cafeteria style operations.
