####### Example 2.

(ii)During the taxable year, an electricity generating facility emits 600,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Carbon capture equipment located at the facility captures a total of 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. 50,000 metric tons of the captured carbon dioxide are utilized in a manner consistent with section 45Q(f)(5) and § 1.45Q-4, and 400,000 metric tons of the carbon dioxide are disposed of in secure geological storage. The electricity generating facility is not a qualified facility under section 45Q(d)(2)(B) during the taxable year because it did not capture at least 500,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide during the taxable year. Further, because the electricity generating facility emitted greater than 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide during the taxable year, but only captured 450,000 metric tons, it is not a qualified facility under section 45Q(d)(2)(A) and § 1.45Q-2(g)(1)(ii).
