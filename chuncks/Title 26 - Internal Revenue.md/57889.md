####### Examination.

(c)Within the 45-day period described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service shall make, to the extent it deems practicable in such period, a limited examination of the application to discover omissions and errors therein. The Service shall calculate the adjustment, which calculation must be set forth in the application for such adjustment, in the manner provided in section 6425(c)(2) for the determination by the corporation of such adjustment. The Service, however, may correct any material error or omission that is discovered upon examination of the application. In determining the adjustment, the Service may correct any mathematical error appearing on the application, and it may likewise make any modification required by the law to correct the corporation's computation of the adjustment. If the required modification has not been made by the corporation and the Service has available the necessary information to make such modification within the 45- day period, it may make such modification. The examination of the application and the allowance of the adjustment shall not prejudice any right of the Service to claim later that the adjustment was improper.
