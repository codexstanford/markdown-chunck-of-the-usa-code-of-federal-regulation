()-()For purposes of determining the extent to which a partner's adjusted basis in its partnership interest is allocable to an excepted or non-excepted trade or business, the partner may look through to such partner's share of the partnership's basis in the partnership's assets, taking into account any adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b), and adjusted to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such partner's share of partnership assets is determined using a reasonable method taking into account special allocations under section 704(b). Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(7) of this section, if a partner's direct and indirect interest in a partnership is greater than or equal to 80 percent of the partnership's capital or profits, the partner must apply the rules in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)() to look through to the partnership's basis in the partnership's assets. If a partner elects or is required to apply the rules in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)() to look through to a partnership's basis in the partnership's assets, the partner allocates the basis of its partnership interest between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses based on the ratio in which the partner's share of the partnership's adjusted tax basis in its trade or business assets is allocated between excepted and non-excepted trade or business assets.
