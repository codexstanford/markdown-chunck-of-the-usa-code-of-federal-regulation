####### Partner-level analysis.

(iii)For the 2022 taxable year, each partner treats its $5x of excess business interest expense from PRS as paid or accrued in that year. See ยง 1.163(j)-6(m)(3). This amount becomes business interest expense that each partner must subject to its own section 163(j) limitation, if any. With this $5x, each partner has $25x of business interest expense for the 2022 taxable year ($20x from its sole proprietorship, plus $5x of excess business interest expense treated as paid or accrued in the 2020 taxable year). X deducts $22x of its business interest expense pursuant to its section 163(j) limitation and carries forward the remainder ($3x) as a disallowed business interest expense carryforward to the taxable year ending December 31, 2023. Y is not subject to section 163(j) because Y qualifies for the small business exemption. Y therefore deducts all $25x of its business interest expense for the 2022 taxable year.
