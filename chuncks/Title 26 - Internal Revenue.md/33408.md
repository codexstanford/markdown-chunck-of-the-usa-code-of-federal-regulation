##### distributions to shareholders
###### ยง 1.815-3 Shareholders surplus account.
####### Special rule; distributions in 1958.

(2)There shall be subtracted from the shareholders surplus account (to the extent thereof) for any taxable year beginning in 1958 the amount of the distributions to shareholders made by the company during 1958. For example, assume S, a stock life insurance company, had additions to its shareholders surplus account (as determined under section 815(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section) for the taxable year 1958 of $10,000, and actually distributed as dividends to its shareholders $8,000 during the year 1958. The balance in S's shareholders surplus account as of January 1, 1959, shall be $2,000. If S had distributed $12,000 as dividends in 1958, the balance in its shareholders surplus account as of January 1, 1959, would be zero and the other accounts referred to in section 815(a)(3) and paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of ยง 1.815-2 would be reduced by $2,000.
