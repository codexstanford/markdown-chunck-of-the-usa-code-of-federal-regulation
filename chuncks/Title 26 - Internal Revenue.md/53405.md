###### ยง 1.1502-55 Computation of alternative minimum tax of consolidated groups.
####### Computational rules,1,Member's contribution to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation.,2

(B)-()Except as provided in the special rule of paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)() of this section, a member's contribution to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation for a consolidated return year equals the member's share of the consolidated net regular tax liability minus its share of consolidated tentative minimum tax. The group computes the member's shares by applying to the respective consolidated amounts the principles of section 1552 and the percentage method under ยง 1.1502-33(d)(3), assuming a 100% allocation of any decreased tax liability. The group makes proper adjustments so that taxes and credits not taken into account in computing the limitation under section 53(c) are not taken into account in computing the member's share of the consolidated net regular tax, etc. (See, for example, the taxes described in section 26(b) that are disregarded in computing regular tax liability.)
