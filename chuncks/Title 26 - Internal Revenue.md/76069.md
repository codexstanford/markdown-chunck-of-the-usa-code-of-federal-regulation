(c)-(1) An "investment" trust will not be classified as a trust if there is a power under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the certificate holders.122 F. 2d 545 (2d Cir. 1941),314 U.S. 701 (1942). An investment trust with a single class of ownership interests, representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust, will be classified as a trust if there is no power under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the certificate holders. An investment trust with multiple classes of ownership interests ordinarily will be classified as a business entity under ยง 301.7701-2; however, an investment trust with multiple classes of ownership interests, in which there is no power under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the certificate holders, will be classified as a trust if the trust is formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of the trust and the existence of multiple classes of ownership interests is incidental to that purpose. See ยง 1.1001-6(f) of this chapter for additional rules that may apply to an investment trust that holds one or more contracts that provide for a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR, as defined in ยง 1.1001-6(h)(4) of this chapter, and for additional rules that may apply to an investment trust with one or more ownership interests that reference a discontinued IBOR.
