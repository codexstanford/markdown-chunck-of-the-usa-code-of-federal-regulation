###### ยง 1.642(h)-2 Excess deductions on termination of an estate or trust.
####### Example.

(2)Assume that a trust distributes all its assets to B and terminates on December 31, Year X. As of that date, it has excess deductions of $18,000, all characterized as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income under section 67(e). B, who reports on the calendar year basis, could claim the $18,000 as a deduction allowable in arriving at B's adjusted gross income for Year X. However, if the deduction (when added to other allowable deductions that B claims for the year) exceeds B's gross income, the excess may not be carried over to any year subsequent to Year X.
