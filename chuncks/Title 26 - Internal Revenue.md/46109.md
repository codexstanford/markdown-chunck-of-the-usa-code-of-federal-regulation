####### Special rules for section 332 transfers.

(4)In the case of a distribution in complete liquidation of a subsidiary to which section 332 applies, the limitation provided in this paragraph (c) is confined to instances in which the basis of the natural resource recapture property in the hands of the transferee is determined, under section 334(b)(1), by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor. Thus, for example, the limitation may apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of natural resource recapture property by a subsidiary corporation to the parent corporation, but does not apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of natural resource recapture property to a minority shareholder. This paragraph (c) does not apply to a liquidating distribution of natural resource recapture property by a subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined under section 334(b)(2) (as in effect before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), by reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary. This paragraph (c) does not apply to a liquidating distribution under section 332 of natural resource recapture property by a subsidiary to its parent if gain is recognized and there is a corresponding increase in the parent's basis in the property (e.g., certain distributions to a tax-exempt or foreign corporation).
