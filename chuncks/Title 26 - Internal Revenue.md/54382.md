###### ยง 1.1504-3 Treatment of stock in a QOF C corporation for purposes of consolidation.
####### Failure of continued qualification.

(3)Consolidation of a subsidiary QOF C corporation is contingent upon continued satisfaction of all of the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section continue to apply (with appropriate modifications to reflect single-entity treatment) following any intercompany transfer of the QOF member stock that is subject to ยง 1.1502-14Z(c)(3)(ii). For example, following an intercompany transfer of the QOF member stock that is subject to ยง 1.1502-14Z(c)(3)(ii), the buying member must maintain a direct investment in the QOF member. On the failure to satisfy any condition of paragraph (b)(2), the QOF member will deconsolidate, and ยง 1.1502-14Z(g) will apply with respect to such deconsolidation.
