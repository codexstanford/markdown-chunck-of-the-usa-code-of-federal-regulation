####### Ascertainment of deduction dependent upon operations loss carryback.

(d)If a life insurance company is entitled in computing its operations loss deduction to a carryback which it is not able to ascertain at the time its return is due, it shall compute the operations loss deduction on its return without regard to such operations loss carryback. When the life insurance company ascertains the operations loss carryback, it may within the applicable period of limitations file a claim for credit or refund of the overpayment, if any, resulting from the failure to compute the operations loss deduction for the taxable year with the inclusion of such carryback; or it may file an application under the provisions of section 6411 for a tentative carryback adjustment.
