###### ยง 1.362-3 Basis of importation property acquired in loss importation transaction.
####### Adjustment to basis of subsidiary stock in triangular reorganizations.

(2)If a corporation (P) computes its basis in stock of a subsidiary (whether S or T) under ยง 1.358-6 (stock basis in certain triangular reorganizations), P's basis in property treated as acquired by P in ยง 1.358-6(c) is determined under section 362(e)(1) and this section to the extent such property, if actually acquired by P, would be importation property acquired in a loss importation transaction. See ยง 1.358-6(c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(2)(ii)(B), and (c)(3)(i). The subsidiary's basis in the property actually acquired in the transaction is determined under applicable law (including this section), without regard to the amount of any adjustment to P's basis in the subsidiary's stock. Thus, the basis of the property in S's or T's hands may differ from the amount of the adjustment to P's basis in its stock of S or T.
