(ii) For purposes of this section, the term "ownership interest" includes fee simple interests, life estates, reversions, remainders, and perpetual easements. In addition, the term "ownership interest" includes any previously created rights to possession or use for all or a portion of any particular year (a leasehold, easement, or "timeshare"), with a remaining term of at least 30 years, including any period for which such rights may be renewed at the option of the holder of the rights, as determined on the date of closing (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section). Thus, for example, a pre-existing leasehold on a building with an original term of 99 years is an ownership interest in real estate for purposes of this section if it has a remaining term of 35 years as of the date of closing, but not if it has a remaining term of only 10 years as of the date of closing. However, the term "ownership interest" does not include an option to acquire otherwise reportable real estate. Further, the term "ownership interest" includes any contractual interest in a sale or exchange of standing timber for a lump-sum payment that is fixed and not contingent.
