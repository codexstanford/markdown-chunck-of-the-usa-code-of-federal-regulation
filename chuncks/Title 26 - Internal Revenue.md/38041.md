###### ยง 1.904-2 Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax.
####### Deduction years.

(ii)Excess limitation for a taxable year absorbs unused foreign tax, regardless of whether the taxpayer chooses to claim a credit under section 901 for the year. In such case, the amount of the excess limitation, if any, for the year is determined in the same manner as though the taxpayer had chosen to claim a credit under section 901 for that year. For purposes of this determination, if the taxpayer has an overall foreign loss account, the excess limitation in a deduction year is determined based on the amount of the overall foreign loss the taxpayer would have recaptured if the taxpayer had chosen to claim a credit under section 901 for that year and had not made an election under ยง 1.904(f)-2(c)(2) to recapture more of the overall foreign loss account than is required under ยง 1.904(f)-2(c)(1).
