###### § 1.401(a)(9)-6 Required minimum distributions for defined benefit plans and annuity contracts.
####### General rule.

A-12. (a)Prior to the date that an annuity contract under an individual account plan is annuitized, the interest of an employee or beneficiary under that contract is treated as an individual account for purposes of section 401(a)(9). Thus, the required minimum distribution for any year with respect to that interest is determined under § 1.401(a)(9)-5 rather than this section. See A-1(e) of § 1.401(a)(9)-5 for rules relating to the satisfaction of section 401(a)(9) in the year that annuity payments commence, A-3(d) of § 1.401(a)(9)-5 for rules relating to qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLACs), defined in A-17 of this section, and A-2(a)(3) of § 1.401(a)(9)-8 for rules relating to the purchase of an annuity contract with a portion of an employee's account balance.
