####### § 301.6692-1 Failure to file actuarial report.
######## Penalty.

(a)In each case in which the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g)) of a defined benefit plan to which the minimum funding standards of section 412 apply fails to file the actuarial report described in section 6059 and § 301.6059-1 within the time prescribed, the plan administrator shall pay a penalty of $1,000. A failure to provide a material item of information called for in the actuarial report is considered a failure to file the report. For this purpose, the signature of an enrolled actuary (see § 301.6059-1(d)) is considered a material item of information.

Further, for any report filed for a plan year ending after January 25, 1982, if the actuary seeks to materially qualify a statement required by § 301.6059-1(c) (4) or (5) there is a failure to provide a material item of information called for in the report. For rules relating to statements not considered as materially qualifying the required statements, see § 301.6059-1(d).
