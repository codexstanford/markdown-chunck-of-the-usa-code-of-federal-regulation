()The result with respect to F1's proportionate share of the income of F2 is the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)() of this section (paragraph (B)() of this Example 1). Because the assets of F1 are measured on the basis of adjusted basis under ยง 1.1297-1(d)(1)(v)(C), F1's proportionate share of the passive assets of F2 is equal to $500x (100% of $500x adjusted bases). Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets that may be treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $375x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's passive assets ($500x) multiplied by 75% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $750x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,000x); and zero, which is F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2 that are treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2, $375x is treated as non-passive, and $125x is treated as passive.
