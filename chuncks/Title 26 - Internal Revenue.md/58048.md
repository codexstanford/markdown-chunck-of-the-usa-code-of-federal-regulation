####### Example 1.

(1)Short year of less than 4 months.

Corporation A is a calendar year taxpayer that was acquired by corporation B, a member of a consolidated group (as defined in ยง 1.1502-1(h)) on April 16, 2009, resulting in A having a short taxable year from January 1, 2009, through April 16, 2009. Because A has a taxable year of less than four full calendar months, no estimated tax payments are required by A for the short taxable year.
