####### Basis of undischarged indebtedness.

(2)The basis of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which was secured by the reacquired real property described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, to the extent that such indebtedness is not discharged upon the reacquisition of such property, shall be zero. Therefore, to the extent not discharged upon the reacquisition of the real property, indebtedness on the original obligation of the purchaser, a substituted obligation of the purchaser, a deficiency judgment entered in a court of law into which the purchaser's obligation has merged, or any other obligation of the purchaser to the seller, shall be zero if such indebtedness constitutes an indebtedness to the seller which was secured by such property.
