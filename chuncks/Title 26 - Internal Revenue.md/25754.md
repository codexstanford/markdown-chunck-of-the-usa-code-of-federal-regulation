####### Carryover of character; disqualified agreements.

(iii)If an agreement (as in effect before its modification) is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement as the result of a determination (whether occurring before or after the modification) under ยง 1.467-3(b)(1)(ii) and the post-modification agreement is a section 467 rental agreement (or the entire agreement (as modified) would be a section 467 rental agreement), the post-modification agreement will, notwithstanding its treatment as a new agreement under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, be subject to constant rental accrual unless the Commissioner determines that, because of the absence of tax avoidance potential, the post-modification agreement should not be treated as a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement.
