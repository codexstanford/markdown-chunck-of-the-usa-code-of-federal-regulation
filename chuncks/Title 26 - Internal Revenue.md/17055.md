####### Stock transferred for services.

(c)For purposes of sections 351(g)(1), 354(a)(2)(C)(i), 355(a)(3)(D), and 356(e)(2), preferred stock containing a right or obligation described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of section 351(g)(2)(A) that is exercisable only upon the holder's separation from service from the issuer or a related person (as described in section 351(g)(3)(B)) will be treated as transferred in connection with the performance of services (and representing reasonable compensation) within the meaning of section 351(g)(2)(C)(i)(II), if such preferred stock is received in exchange for (or in a distribution with respect to) existing stock containing a similar right or obligation (exercisable only upon separation from service) and the existing stock was transferred in connection with the performance of services for the issuer or a related person (and represented reasonable compensation when transferred). In applying the rules relating to NQPS, the preferred stock received will continue to be treated as transferred in connection with the performance of services (and representing reasonable compensation) in subsequent transactions involving such stock, and the principles of this paragraph (c) apply to such transactions.
