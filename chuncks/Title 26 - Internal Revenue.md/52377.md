##### Computation of Separate Taxable Income
###### § 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Tiering-up of investment adjustments provided by section 1400Z-2.

(d)Basis increases in a qualifying investment in a QOF under sections 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii), 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iv), and 1400Z-2(c) are treated as satisfying the requirements of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(A) and thus qualify as tax-exempt income to the QOF owner. Therefore, if the QOF owner is a member of a consolidated group and is owned by other members of the same consolidated group (upper-tier members), the upper-tier members increase their bases in the shares of the QOF owner under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii). However, there is no basis adjustment under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) in shares of upper-tier members with regard to a basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(c) and § 1.1400Z2(c)-1 unless and until the basis of the qualifying investment is adjusted to its fair market value, as provided in section 1400Z-2(c) and § 1.1400Z2(c)-1.
