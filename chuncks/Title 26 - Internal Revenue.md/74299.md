####### Limitation.

(2)The amount of any credit allowed for the taxable year pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the product of the amount of the resident tax against which the credit is allowed, as computed without subtracting any such credit, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by both the State imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed and the other jurisdiction whose tax is being credited, and the denominator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by the State imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "income subject to tax" means the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income which is taken into account for purposes of computing tax liability; in the case of a qualified resident tax, an appropriate modification shall be made to take into account any adjustments which are made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) and (3) of ยง 301.6362-2, or pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(1)(ii) of ยง 301.6362-3.
