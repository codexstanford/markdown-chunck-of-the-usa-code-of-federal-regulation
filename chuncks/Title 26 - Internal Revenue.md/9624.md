###### § 1.168(i)-7 Accounting for MACRS property.
####### Required use of single asset accounts.

(b)A taxpayer must account for an asset in a single asset account if the taxpayer uses the asset both in a trade or business or for the production of income and in a personal activity, or if the taxpayer places in service and disposes of the asset during the same taxable year. Also, if general asset account treatment for an asset terminates under § 1.168(i)-1(c)(1)(ii)(A), (e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(v), (e)(3)(vii), (g), or (h)(1), as applicable, the taxpayer must account for the asset in a single asset account beginning in the taxable year in which the general asset account treatment for the asset terminates. If a taxpayer accounts for an asset in a multiple asset account or a pool and the taxpayer disposes of the asset, the taxpayer must account for the asset in a single asset account beginning in the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. See § 1.168(i)-8(h)(2)(i). If a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and § 1.168(i)-8(d)(1) applies to that disposition, the taxpayer must account for the disposed portion in a single asset account beginning in the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. See § 1.168(i)-8(h)(3)(i).
