####### Manufacturing, producing, constructing, or assembling activity.

(iii)If a person who manufactures, produces, constructs, or assembles property is liable with regard to the consumption or use of such property, such liability will be considered to result from the activity performed of manufacturing, producing, constructing, or assembling such property. If such person manufactures, produces, constructs, or assembles more than one type of product, the liability with regard to the consumption or use of one of such products will be considered to result from the activity performed of manufacturing, producing, constructing, or assembling that particular product. For example, the liability of a building contractor, which constructs apartment buildings only in the United States, for the improper construction of, or the failure to construct, an apartment building, will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States. In further illustration, the liability (which is covered by a single policy of insurance) of a domestic corporation, which assembles refrigerators exclusively in the United States and manufactures automobiles both in a foreign country and in the United States through substantial activity carried on in each of such countries, for the negligent manufacturing of a part for one of the automobiles by the foreign branch, will be considered to result from an activity ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States.
