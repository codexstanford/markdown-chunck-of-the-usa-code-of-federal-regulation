####### 2,Conclusion.

()Because the compensation paid by all affiliated group members is aggregated for purposes of section 162(m)(1), $2,000,000 of the aggregate compensation paid is nondeductible. Corporations N and O each are treated as paying a ratable portion of the nondeductible compensation. Thus, two thirds of each corporation's payment will be nondeductible. Corporation N has a nondeductible compensation expense of $1,400,000 ($2,100,000 x $2,000,000/$3,000,000). Corporation O has a nondeductible compensation expense of $600,000 ($900,000 x $2,000,000/$3,000,000).
