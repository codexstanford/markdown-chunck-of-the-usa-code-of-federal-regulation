####### Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.

(ii)The IRS may determine in its discretion that the trustee may not have substantially complied with the requirements applicable to a trustee of a trustee-documented trust. This determination is based on the information reporting forms filed with the IRS by a trustee with respect to any trustee-documented trust subject to a Model 2 IGA for each calendar year (or the absence of such reporting), the certification described in paragraph (l)(2) of this section (or the absence of such certification), or any other information related to the trustee's compliance with respect to any trustee-documented trust for purposes of satisfying the trust's applicable Model 2 IGA requirements. In such a case, the IRS may request from the responsible officer information necessary to verify the trustee's compliance with such requirements. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the circumstances surrounding the trustee's potential failure to comply with the requirements of an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to one or more trustee-documented trusts. The IRS may notify the applicable Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that the trustee has not complied with its requirements as a trustee of one or more trustee-documented trusts.
