######## Deposit insurance.

(d)Deposit insurance payable to depositors shall not be treated as an asset of the bank and shall be disregarded in determining the sufficiency of the assets to meet the claims of depositors. For taxable years ending on or after April 22, 1992, deposit insurance does not include Federal Financial Assistance (as defined in section 597) and other payments described in section 597(a) prior to its amendment by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 and, therefore, such payments must be taken into account to determine whether a bank's assets are sufficient to meet claims of depositors.
