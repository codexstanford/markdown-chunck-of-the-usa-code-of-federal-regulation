####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, in the case of a disposition of assets undertaken with a principal purpose of artificially shifting the amount of basis allocable to excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses on a determination date, the additional basis or change in use will not be taken into account. Because V's sale of farming equipment to U for storage in Business F's facilities is undertaken with a principal purpose of shifting basis from Business L to Business F, the additional basis Business F receives from these transactions will not be taken into account for purposes of this section. Instead, the basis of the farming equipment will be allocated as though the farming equipment continued to be used in Business L.
