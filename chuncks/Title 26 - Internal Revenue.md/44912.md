####### Scope of rules.

(v)The rules provided by this subparagraph are for the purpose of computing the amount of the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year pursuant to the provisions of section 1212(b)(3) and this subparagraph. More specifically, their operation permits the limited use of a long-term capital loss carried to the taxable year from a taxable year beginning before December 31, 1969, in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis in computing the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year. These rules have no application to, or effect upon, a determination of the character or amount of capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) reportable in the taxable year. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section and ยง 1.1212-1 for the determination of the amount and character of capital gains and losses reportable in the taxable year. Further, except to the extent that their application may affect the amount of the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year and thus the amount to be treated as short-term capital loss for carryover purposes under section 1212(b) and ยง 1.1212-1(b)(2), these rules have no effect upon a determination of the character or amount of capital losses carried to or from the taxable year pursuant to section 1212(b) and ยง 1.1212-1(b).
