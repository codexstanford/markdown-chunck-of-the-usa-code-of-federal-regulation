###### § 48.6421-3 Time for filing claim for credit or payment.
####### In general.

(a)A claim for credit or payment described in § 48.6421-1 with respect to gasoline used in a qualified business use or as a fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation) or in § 48.6421-2 with respect to gasoline used either in an intercity or local bus while engaged in furnishing (for compensation) passenger land transportation available to the general public or in school bus transportation operations, shall cover only gasoline used during the taxable year, or when paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, gasoline used during the calendar quarter. Therefore, gasoline on hand at the end of a taxable year, or, if applicable, a calendar quarter, such as gasoline in fuel supply tanks of vehicles or in storage tanks or drums, must be excluded from a claim filed for the taxable year or calendar quarter, as the case may be. However, this gasoline may be included in a claim filed for a later taxable year or a later calendar quarter if it is used during that later year or quarter in a qualified business use, as fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation), or in intercity, local, or school buses. Gasoline used during the taxable year or calendar quarter may be covered by the claim for that period although the gasoline was not paid for at the time the claim is filed. For purposes of applying this section, a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6421-1(c) or § 48.6421-2(c) is considered to have as its taxable year, the calendar year or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books; see § 48.6421-4(g).
