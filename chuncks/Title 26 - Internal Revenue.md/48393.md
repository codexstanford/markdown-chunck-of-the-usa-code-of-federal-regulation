####### Gain arising from an inclusion event,In general.

(iv)-(A)Gain that is otherwise required to be included in gross income under ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(1), whether from the disposition of an entire interest in a QOF or a disposition of a partial interest, may be eligible for deferral under section 1400Z-2(a)(1), provided that all of the requirements to elect to defer gain under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) are met. For purposes of determining whether such gain is eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) and this paragraph (b)(11)(iv)(A), the eligible taxpayer should treat such inclusion gain as if it was originally realized upon the occurrence of the inclusion event rather than on the sale or exchange that gave rise to the eligible gain to which the inclusion event relates.
