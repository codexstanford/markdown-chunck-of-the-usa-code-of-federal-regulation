####### In general.

(a)A corporation that issues fast-pay stock in a fast-pay arrangement described in § 1.7701(l)-3(b)(1) is a withholding agent with respect to payments made on the fast-pay stock and payments deemed made under the recharacterization rules of § 1.7701(l)-3. Except as provided in this paragraph (a) or in paragraph (b) of this section, the withholding tax rules under section 1441 and section 1442 apply with respect to a fast-pay arrangement described in § 1.7701(l)-3(c)(1)(i) in accordance with the recharacterization rules provided in § 1.7701(l)-3(c). In all cases, notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if at any time the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that the Commissioner has exercised the discretion under either § 1.7701(l)-3(c)(1)(ii) to apply the recharacterization rules of § 1.7701(l)-3(c), or § 1.7701(l)-3(d) to depart from the recharacterization rules of § 1.7701(l)-3(c) for a taxpayer, the withholding agent must withhold on payments made (or deemed made) to that taxpayer in accordance with the characterization of the fast-pay arrangement imposed by the Commissioner under § 1.7701(l)-3.
