####### Taxable year 2023.

(C)The payment received during 2023 meets the definition of an advance payment under ยง 1.451-8(a)(1). Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, D must determine the amount that is required to be included in gross income in 2023 under the rules in ยง 1.451-8. Because D uses the deferral method under ยง 1.451-8(b), D is required to include $20x of the $25x payment in gross income in 2023 as $20x of such payment was treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" as of the end of 2023.
