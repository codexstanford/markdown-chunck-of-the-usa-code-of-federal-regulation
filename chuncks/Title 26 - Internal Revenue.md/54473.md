##### Regulations Applicable to Taxable Years Before January 1, 1997
###### § 1.1502-15A Limitations on the allowance of built-in deductions for consolidated return years beginning before January 1, 1997.
####### Limitation on built-in deductions,General rule.

(a)-(1)Built-in deductions (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) for a taxable year shall be subject to the limitation of § 1.1502-21A(c) (determined without regard to such deductions and without regard to net operating loss carryovers to such year) and the limitation of § 1.1502-22A(c) (determined without regard to such deductions and without regard to capital loss carryovers to such year). If as a result of applying such limitations, built-in deductions are not allowable in such consolidated return year, such deductions shall be treated as a net operating loss or net capital loss (as the case may be) sustained in such year and shall be carried to those taxable years (consolidated or separate) to which a consolidated net operating loss or a consolidated net capital loss could be carried under §§ 1.1502-21A, 1.1502-22A and 1.1502-79A, (or §§ 1.1502-21T and 1.1502-22T, as appropriate) except that such losses shall be treated as losses subject to the limitations contained in §§ 1.1502-21T(c) or 1.1502-22T(c) (or §§ 1.1502-21A(c), 1.1502-22A(c), as appropriate), as the case may be. Thus, for example, if member X sells a capital asset during a consolidated return year at a $1,000 loss and such loss is treated as a built-in deduction, then such loss shall be subject to the limitation contained in § 1.1502-22(c), which, in general, would allow such loss to be offset only against X's own capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977). Assuming X had no capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) reflected in such year (after taking into account its capital losses, other than capital loss carryovers and the built-in deduction), such $1,000 loss shall be treated as a net capital loss and shall be carried over for 5 years under § 1.1502-22, subject to the limitation contained in § 1.1502-22(c) for consolidated return years.
