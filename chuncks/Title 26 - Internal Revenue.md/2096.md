#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### ยง 1.46-9 Requirements for taxpayers electing an extra one-half percent additional investment credit.
####### Effect of section 415.

(4)In applying the limitations of section 415 to limitation years beginning after January 19, 1979, allocations of TRASOP securities are considered in the following order: first, allocations under ยง 1.46-8; second, allocations under this section. See ยง 1.46-8(d)(6)(v) concerning the allocation of amounts under any other defined contribution plan. No suspense or escrow account may be maintained to hold contributions under this section that are unallocated because of section 415. Thus, section 415 in effect limits the availability of an extra additional credit in a particular year. However, if the plan so provides, a potential extra additional credit is treated as an investment credit carryover under the carryover option described in ยง 1.46-8(c)(1)(ii) to the extent that it is not used in a particular year because of section 415.
