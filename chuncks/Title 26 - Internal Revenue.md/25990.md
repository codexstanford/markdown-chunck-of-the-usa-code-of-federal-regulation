(2)For purposes of this paragraph (b), the termmeans any act described in section 4951(d), except-

(i) A payment by a nuclear decommissioning fund for the purpose of satisfying, in whole or in part, the liability of the electing taxpayer for decommissioning costs of the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates, whether such payment is made to an unrelated party in satisfaction of the decommissioning liability or to the plant operator or other otherwise disqualified person as reimbursement solely for actual expenses paid by such person in satisfaction of the decommissioning liability;

(ii) A withdrawal of an excess contribution by the electing taxpayer pursuant to the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

(iii) A withdrawal by the electing taxpayer of amounts that have been treated as distributed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section;

(iv) A payment of amounts remaining in a nuclear decommissioning fund to the electing taxpayer after the termination of such fund (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section);

(v) Any act described in section 4951(d)(2)(B) or (C). Whether payments under section 4951(c)(2)(C) are not excessive is determined under ยง 1.162-7. See ยง 53.4941(d)-3(c)(1). The fact that the amount of such payments that are not excessive are also more than the disqualified person's actual expenses for such personal services does not cause the payments to constitute acts of self-dealing, even if the difference is properly characterized as profit, or direct or indirect overhead;

(vi) Any act that is described in ยง 53.4951-1(c) of this chapter and is undertaken to facilitate the temporary investment of assets or the payment of reasonable administrative expenses of the nuclear decommissioning fund; or

(vii) A payment by a nuclear decommissioning fund for the performance of trust functions and certain general banking services by a bank or trust company that is a disqualified person if the banking services are reasonable and necessary to carry out the purposes of the fund and the compensation paid to the bank or trust company for such services, taking into account the fair interest rate for the use of the funds by the bank or trust company, is not excessive.
