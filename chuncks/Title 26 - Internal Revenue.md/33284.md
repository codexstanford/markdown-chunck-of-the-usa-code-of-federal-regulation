###### ยง 1.807-4 Adjustment for change in computing reserves.
####### Analysis.

(ii)IC must take into account under section 481 and the administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner the $10x difference between the reserves for the relevant contracts issued prior to 2021 computed under the old basis ($110x) and the reserves for such contracts computed under the new basis ($120x). For purposes of determining any net increase or net decrease in reserves in taxable year 2021 under section 807(a) or (b), IC's closing balance of life insurance reserves computed under section 807(d) with respect to the relevant contracts is $110x for contracts issued prior to 2021 (computed on the old basis) and $15x for contracts issued during 2021 (computed on the new basis). IC's opening balance in 2022 for life insurance reserves for the relevant contracts is $135x (computed on the new basis).
