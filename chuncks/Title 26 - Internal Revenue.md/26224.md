####### Intercompany transactions,In general.

(6)-(i)Section 1.1502-13 applies to determine the treatment under section 469 of intercompany items and corresponding items from intercompany transactions between members of a consolidated group. For example, the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c) treats the selling member (S) and the buying member (B) as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining whether S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items are from a passive activity. Thus, for purposes of applying § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iii) and § 1.469-2T(d)(5)(ii) to property sold by S to B in an intercompany transaction-

(A) S and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation for determining the uses of the property during the 12-month period preceding its disposition to a nonmember, and generally have an aggregate holding period for the property; and

(B) § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iv) does not apply.
