####### Reduction of existing partners' bases.

(C)Each existing partner's basis in each existing partnership oil or gas property is reduced by the percentage of the partnership's aggregate basis in the property that is allocated to the contributing partner. Thus, if one-third of the partnership's aggregate basis in a property is allocated to a contributing partner because the contributing partner has a one-third interest in partnership capital, after the admission of the contributing partner each existing partner's basis (including the contributing partner's pre-existing basis if such partner is also an existing partner) in each property equals the partner's basis (prior to the admission) reduced by one-third.
