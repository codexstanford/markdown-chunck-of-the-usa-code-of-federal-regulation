####### Pre-tax deductions of CFC1 and CFC2.

(ii)For both U.S. and Country X tax purposes, in 2019, CFC1 incurs 1,500,000u of deductible expenses other than current year taxes that are allocable to all gross income. For U.S. tax purposes, under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T, 750,000u of such deductions are apportioned to each of CFC1's foreign oil and gas extraction income and interest income. Under Country X law, 1,000,000u of deductions are allocated and apportioned to the 4,000,000u treated as a dividend, and 500,000u of deductions are allocated and apportioned to the 2,000,000u of foreign oil and gas extraction income. Under Country X law, no deductions are allocable to the interest income. Country X imposes eligible current year tax of 900,000u on a base of 4,500,000u (6,000,000u gross income-1,500,000u deductions) consisting of 3,000,000u (4,000,000u-1,000,000u) attributable to CFC1's section 959(b) distribution and 1,500,000u (2,000,000u-500,000u) attributable to CFC1's foreign oil and gas extraction income. In 2019, CFC2 has no expenses (including current year taxes).
