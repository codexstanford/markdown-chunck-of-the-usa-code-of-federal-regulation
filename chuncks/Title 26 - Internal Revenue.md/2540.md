###### ยง 1.48-12 Qualified rehabilitated building; expenditures incurred after December 31, 1981.
####### Special rule for certain rehabilitations begun before an area is designated as a registered historic district.

(6)In general, the exclusion from the definition of qualified rehabilitation expenditure in paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section applies to any rehabilitation expenditures that are incurred after a building becomes a certified historic structure within the meaning of section 48 (g)(3)A) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the area in which a building is located becomes a registered historic district within the meaning of section 48 (g)(3)(B) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Rehabilitation expenditures incurred prior to such date, however, are not disqualified. In addition, rehabilitation expenditures made after the date the area in which a building is located becomes a registered historic district shall not be disqualified under paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section in any case in which physical work on the rehabilitation of a building begins prior to the date the taxpayer knows or has reason to know of an intention to nominate the area in which such building is located as a registered historic district. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(6), the taxpayer knows or has reason to know of such an intention if there is (A) a communication (written or oral) to the owner of any building within the district from the Department of the Interior, or any agency or instrumentality of the appropriate state or local government (or a designee of such agency or instrumentality) that the district in which the building is located is being considered for designation as a registered historic district, (B) a legal notice of such consideration published in a newspaper, or (C) a public meeting held to discuss such consideration. In order to take advantage of the special rule of this paragraph (d)(6), the taxpayer must attach to the Form 3468 filed for the taxable year in which the credit is claimed a statement that the taxpayer in good faith did not know, or have reason to know, of an intention to nominate the area in which the building is located as a registered historic district.
