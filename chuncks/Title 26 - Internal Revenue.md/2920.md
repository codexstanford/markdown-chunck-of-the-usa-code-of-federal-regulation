(3)The phrase "deduction allowable for the taxable year for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, or amortization" and references in this paragraph to "allowable depreciation or amortization" include deductions allowable for the taxable year under sections 162, 167 (including depreciation allowable under section 167 by reason of section 179), 169, 184, 185, 212, or 611 for the depreciation or amortization of section 1245 property. Such phrase does not include depreciation allowable in the year in which the section 1245 property is disposed of. Amortization of certified pollution control facilities under section 169, and amortization of railroad rolling stock under section 184 are not to be treated as amortization for purposes of section 57(a)(3) to the extent such amounts are treated as an item of tax preference under section 57(a) (4) or (5) (see paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section). For the determination of "allowable depreciation or amortization" for taxable years in which the taxpayer has taken no deduction, see ยง 1.1016-3(a)(2).
