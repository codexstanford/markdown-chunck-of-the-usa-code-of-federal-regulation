###### § 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Intercompany transfers of a qualifying investment,In general.

(3)-(i)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(3), when one member (S) transfers its qualifying investment to another member (B), the transaction is not treated as an intercompany transaction within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(b)(1) for purposes of applying the rules of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Therefore, § 1.1502-13(c) does not apply to treat S and B as divisions of a single entity for purposes of section 1400Z-2. For example, if S transfers its qualifying investment to B in a section 351 transaction, the transfer is an inclusion event for S under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). In addition, because the transfer is not an intercompany transaction for purposes of section 1400Z-2, § 1.1502-13 does not apply to continue S's deferral under § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(a)(1).
