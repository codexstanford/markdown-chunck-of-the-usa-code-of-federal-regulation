####### Partial dispositions.

(ii)A partial disposition by the U.S. transferor of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation received in the initial transfer in a transaction otherwise described in paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section shall reduce the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement based on the relative fair market value of the stock disposed of (measured at the time of the disposition) compared to the fair market value of all of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation received in the initial transfer (measured at the time of the disposition). For determining whether the basis condition of paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section is satisfied in the case of a partial disposition, the aggregate basis of the stock disposed of is compared to a proportionate amount (based on fair market value, as measured at the time of the partial disposition) of the amounts described in paragraphs (o)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. For an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (o)(1)(ii), see paragraph (q)(2)(xv) of this section.
