####### Analysis.

(B)Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. X is not eligible for the de minimis exception in paragraph (j)(2)(i) because X is not leasing at least 90 percent of the building, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control that operates an excepted trade or business and/or unrelated parties. Under the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 60 percent of the building that is subleased to unrelated parties, determined by adding 40 percent (50 percent of the 80 percent leasehold interest) from Z's sublease to an unrelated party and 20 percent from Y's sublease to unrelated parties (40 + 20). X is not eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 40 percent of the building subleased to Z, because Z is a related party that does not operate an excepted trade or business.
