####### Special rule.

(vi)Solely for the purpose of meeting the 75 percent requirement of this subparagraph (4), the walls of an uncovered internal shaft designed solely to bring light or air into the center of a building which are completely surrounded by external walls of the building and which enclose space not designated for occupancy or other use by people (other than for maintenance or emergency) are not considered external walls. Thus, a wall of a light well in the center of an office building is not an external wall. However, walls surrounding an uncovered courtyard which is usable by the building's occupants, (e.g., at lunch time) are external walls.
