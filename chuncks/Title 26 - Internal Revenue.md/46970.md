####### Dividends paid out of accumulated earnings and profits.

(C)To the extent that a dividend from a related person is treated as paid out of the related person's accumulated earnings and profits, the dividend is treated as paid ratably out of accumulated earnings and profits of the related person for prior taxable years (beginning with the most recently accumulated) that are attributable to passive income and to non-passive income, which may be determined in the same manner as in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. Alternatively, the accumulated earnings and profits may be allocated based on the ratio of accumulated earnings and profits that are attributable to passive income and to non-passive income during either the related party period or the three-year period. The related party period is the entire period during which the related person was related to the recipient. The three-year period is the three taxable years immediately preceding the related person's taxable year that ends with or within the current taxable year of the recipient. The three-year period may be used only if the related person has been related to the recipient for a period longer than the three taxable years immediately preceding the recipient's taxable year.
