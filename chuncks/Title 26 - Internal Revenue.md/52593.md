() When the Year 3 CNOL is carried back to Year 1, the P group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for Year 1 is the lesser of $46 (the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to Year 1) or $41 ($16 + $25; see the computation in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F)() of this section). Thus, the total amount of the P group's Year 1 income that may be offset by the P group's Year 2 and Year 3 CNOLs is $41 ($16 from Year 2 + $25 from Year 3). As a result, the P group reports $4 of income ($45-$41) in Year 1 that is ineligible for offset by any other NOLs. The P group carries over its remaining $5 CNOL ($46-$41) to future years.
