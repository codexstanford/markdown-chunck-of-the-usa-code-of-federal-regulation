####### Example 20: Airline reward miles,Facts.

(xx)-(A)On January 1, 2021, W, a passenger airline company, sells a customer a $700 airline ticket to fly roundtrip in 2021. As part of the purchase, the customer receives 7,000 reward points (air miles) from W to be used for future air travel. The reward points are not redeemable for cash and have a 2-year expiration date. W tracks the issue date, redemption date, and expiration date of each customer's reward points. Under the terms of U's reward program, when the customer redeems reward points they are deemed to use the earliest issued points first. In its AFS, W treats the rewards points as a separate performance obligation and allocates $35 of the $700 ticket price to the reward points. W is able to determine the extent to which a payment that is allocated to a reward point is taken into account in AFS revenue in the year of receipt. W takes into account all $35 as AFS revenue in 2023 when the customer redeems the air miles.
