######## Effect of inconsistent treatment,Determination of underpayment of tax resulting from inconsistent treatment.

(b)-(1)If a partner fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, unless the partner provides notice in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the IRS may adjust the inconsistently reported partnership-related item on the partner's return to make it consistent with the treatment of such item on the partnership return (or where no partnership return was filed, remove any treatment of such items from the partner's return) and determine any underpayment of tax that results from that adjustment. For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the underpayment of tax is the amount by which the correct tax, as determined by making the partner's return consistent with the partnership return, exceeds the tax shown on the partner's return.
