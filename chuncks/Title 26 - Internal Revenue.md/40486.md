####### Liability from service or driving activity-(a) In general.

(v)If a person is liable with regard to any service activity performed, or is liable with regard to driving activity performed in connection with a motor vehicle, ship or boat, aircraft, or railroad rolling stock, whether or not exclusively used in the commercial transportation of persons or property, such liability will be considered to result from such service or driving activity. For example, if an oil company which drills for oil exclusively in a foreign country is liable with regard to the negligent handling by its employees of explosives in the course of such drilling there, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States and will be considered a liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States. In further illustration, if a corporation which services machinery exclusively in a foreign country under servicing contracts is liable with regard to the negligent repairing of a machine under such a contract, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States and will be considered a liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States.
