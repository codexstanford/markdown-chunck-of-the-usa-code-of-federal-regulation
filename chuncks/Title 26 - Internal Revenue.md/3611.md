####### Space-available flight.

(2)The commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h) is available to value a space-available flight. The term "space-available flight" means a flight on a commercial aircraft-

(i) Which is subject to the same types of restrictions customarily associated with flying on an employee "stand-by" or "space-available" basis, and

(ii) Which meets the definition of a no-additional-cost service under section 132(b), except that the flight is provided to an individual other than the employee or an individual treated as the employee under section 132(f). Thus, a flight is not a space-available flight if the employer guarantees the employee a seat on the flight or if the nondiscrimination requirements of section 132(h)(1) and ยง 1.132-8 are not satisfied. A flight may be a space-available flight even if the airline that is the actual carrier is not the employer of the employee.
