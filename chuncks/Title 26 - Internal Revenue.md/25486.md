####### Application,Required use by certain pass-through entities,General rule.

(4)-(i)- (A)The simplified marginal impact method is required to be used with respect to income reported from domestic contracts by a pass-through entity that is either a partnership, an S corporation, or a trust, and that is not closely held. With respect to contracts described in the preceding sentence, the simplified marginal impact method is applied by the pass-through entity at the entity level. The pass-through entity determines the amount of any hypothetical underpayment or overpayment for a redetermination year using the highest rate of tax in effect for corporations under section 11. However, for redetermination years beginning before January 1, 2018, the pass-through entity uses the highest rates of tax in effect for corporations under section 11 and section 55(b)(1). Further, the pass-through entity uses the highest rates of tax imposed on individuals under section 1 and section 55(b)(1) if, at all times during the redetermination year involved (that is, the year in which the hypothetical increase or decrease in income arises), more than 50 percent of the interests in the entity were held by individuals directly or through 1 or more pass-through entities.
