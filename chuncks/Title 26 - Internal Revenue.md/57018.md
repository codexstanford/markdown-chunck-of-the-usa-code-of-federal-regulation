####### Transitional rule for certain obligations existing on December 31, 1984,In general.

(ii)-(A)An obligation that existed on December 31, 1984, is not a mortgage if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, the interest recipient reasonably classified the obligation as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation. A reasonable classification of an obligation must be consistent with industry practices and determined according to the purpose of the obligation, the property securing the obligation, and any other reasonable factor. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), an obligation was not reasonably classified as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, more than one-half of the obligations in the particular class in which the obligation was classified were secured primarily by real property.
