###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Example 1.

(A)CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC1. CFC1 and CFC2 are incorporated in Country M. In Year 1, USP sells tractors to CFC2, which CFC2 sells to X, an unrelated foreign corporation organized in Country M. The tractors are to be used in Country M. CFC2 uses a substantial part of its assets in its trade or business located in Country M. CFC2 has uncollected trade receivables from X that it factors to CFC1. The income is not related person factoring income because it is described in section 864(d)(7) (income eligible for the same country exception) and is tested income. If section 864(d)(1) applied, the income CFC1 derived from the receivables would meet the definition of export financing interest. The income, therefore, is considered to be export financing interest and is general category income to CFC1 and may be section 951A category income to USP.
