() Under section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the P group's CNOL deduction for 2021 equals the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 plus the group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit. The P group has $60 of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 ($90-$30). Because no member of the P group is a nonlife insurance company, paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section applies to determine the computation of the group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for 2021. See also section 172(a)(2)(B). Therefore, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit of the P group for 2021 is $48, which equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to 2021 ($100), or 80 percent of the excess of the P group's consolidated taxable income for that year computed without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250 ($120) over the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 ($60) (that is, 80 percent x $60). Thus, the P group's CNOL deduction for 2021 equals $108 ($60 pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 + $48 post-2017 CNOL deduction limit). See section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The P group offsets $108 of its $120 of 2021 consolidated taxable income, resulting in $12 of consolidated taxable income in 2021. The remaining $52 of the P group's 2020 CNOL ($100-$48) is carried over to future taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II).
