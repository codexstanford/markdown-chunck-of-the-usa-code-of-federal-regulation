####### Cost of other benefits.

(4)If a benefit described in this paragraph is provided under a policy under which both the employer and his employees contribute, then, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the employer and the employees will be treated as contributing toward the payment of such benefit at the same rate as they contribute toward the cost of group-term life insurance on the employees' lives. A separate allocation of employer and employee contributions for such benefits is permissible only if-

(i) Such separate allocation is set forth in the group policy and is applicable to all the employees covered under such policy;

(ii) Such separate allocation is followed in transactions between the insurer and the group-policyholder; and

(iii) The allocation set forth in the policy satisfies the requirements of the law of the jurisdiction which is applicable to the contract regarding any minimum or maximum contribution rate by the employer or the employees.
