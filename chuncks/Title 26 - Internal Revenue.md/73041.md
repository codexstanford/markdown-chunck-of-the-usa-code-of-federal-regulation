######## Effect of modification,In general.

(b)-(1)A modification of an imputed underpayment under this section that is approved by the IRS may result in an increase or decrease in the amount of an imputed underpayment set forth in the NOPPA. A modification under this section has no effect on the amount of any partnership adjustment determined under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C of chapter 63). See paragraph (e) of this section for the effect of modification on adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment. A modification may increase or decrease an imputed underpayment by affecting the extent to which adjustments factor into the determination of the imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the tax rate that is applied in calculating the imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), and the number and composition of imputed underpayments, including the placement of adjustments in groupings and subgroupings (if applicable) (as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section), as well as to the extent of other modifications allowed under rules provided in forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS (as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section). If a partnership requests more than one modification under this section, modifications are taken into account in the following order:

(i) Modifications that affect the extent to which an adjustment factors into the determination of the imputed underpayment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

(ii) Modification of the number and composition of imputed underpayments under paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

(iii) Modifications that affect the tax rate under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
