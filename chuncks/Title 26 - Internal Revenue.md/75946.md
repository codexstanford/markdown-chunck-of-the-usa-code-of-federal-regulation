######## Net collections.

(1)(i) In determining net collections for a taxable year, appropriate adjustment between the two jurisdictions shall be made on a proportionate basis for underpayments of income taxes for such taxable year, credits allowed against the income tax for such taxable year (other than the credit for taxes withheld under section 3402 on wages), and refunds made of income taxes paid with respect to such taxable year. Thus, if a net operating loss results in a carryback to an earlier taxable year which gives rise to a refund for that earlier year, an adjustment must be made based upon the proportion which the amount of tax covered by one jurisdiction into the treasury of the other jurisdiction for that earlier year bears to the total amount of tax paid for that earlier year, even though the loss may have resulted from activities in one jurisdiction and the income, against which the loss was offset, was earned in the other jurisdiction. Similar adjustments must be made for foreign tax credit carrybacks even though different jurisdictions are involved. If, for example, an individual pays income tax of $30,000 to the United States for 1974 and $10,000 of such tax is covered into the treasury of Guam, and if for 1975 such individual has a net operating loss attributable to a trade or business carried on in the United States which loss is carried back to 1974 and gives rise to a refund of $15,000 by the United States, Guam must cover into the Treasury of the United States the amount of $5,000 which is the adjustment based upon the refund ($15,000 x $10,000/$30,000 = $5,000).

(ii) Tax withheld from the compensation of any member of the Armed Forces described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section which is paid to Guam pursuant to section 7654(d) and paragraph (e) of this section shall be taken into account in determining the amount required to be covered into the treasury of Guam under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, any underpayment of tax is treated as attributable on a pro rata basis to income from sources within the United States, Guam, and sources other than within the United States or Guam, respectively, and is divided between the United States and Guam under the rules in paragraph (b) of this section.
