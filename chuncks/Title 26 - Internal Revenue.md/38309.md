() Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $150x related person interest payment is allocable to CFC's passive category foreign personal holding company income. Therefore, the $150x interest payment is passive category income to USP. Because the entire related person interest payment is allocated to passive category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, none of the related person interest payment is apportioned to general category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the entire amount of the related person debt is allocable to passive category assets ($1,500x = $1,500x x $150x/$150x). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, $20x of the interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to passive category income ($20x = $100x x ($2,000x - $1,500x)/($4,000x - $1,500x)), and $80x of the interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to general category income ($80x = $100x x $2,000x/($4,000x - $1,500x)).
