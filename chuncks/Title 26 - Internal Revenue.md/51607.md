####### Late-joining sponsored FFIs.

(ii)In general, with respect to a certification period, a sponsoring entity is not required to make a certification for a sponsored FFI that first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity during the six-month period before the end of the sponsoring entity's certification period, provided that the sponsoring entity makes certifications for such sponsored FFI for subsequent certification periods and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the sponsoring entity during which such FFI was sponsored by the sponsoring entity. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to a sponsored FFI that, immediately before the FFI agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity, was a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or sponsored, closely held investment vehicle of another sponsoring entity. The sponsoring entity may certify for a sponsored FFI described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the sponsoring entity before the date that the FFI first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity if the sponsoring entity obtains from the FFI (or the FFI's sponsoring entity, if applicable) a written certification that the FFI has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: the sponsoring entity does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the sponsored FFI for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period during which such FFI was sponsored by the sponsoring entity.
