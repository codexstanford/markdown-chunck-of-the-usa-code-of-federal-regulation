####### § 31.3121(a)(1)-1 Annual wage limitation.
######## In general.

(a)(1) The term "wages" does not include that part of the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee within any calendar year-

(i) After 1954 and before 1959 which exceeds the first $4,200 of remuneration,

(ii) After 1958 and before 1966 which exceeds the first $4,800 of remuneration,

(iii) After 1965 and before 1968 which exceeds the first $6,600 of remuneration,

(iv) After 1967 and before 1972 which exceeds the first $7,800 of remuneration,

(v) After 1971 and before 1973 which exceeds the first $9,000 of remuneration,

(vi) After 1972 and before 1974 which exceeds the first $10,800 of remuneration,

(vii) After 1973 and before 1975 which exceeds the first $13,200 of remuneration, or

(viii) After 1974 which exceeds the amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) which is effective for such calendar year

(2) The annual wage limitation applies only if the remuneration received during any 1 calendar year by an employee from the same employer for employment performed after 1936 exceeds the amount of such limitation. The limitation in such case relates to the amount of remuneration received during any 1 calendar year for employment after 1936 and not to the amount of remuneration for employment performed in any 1 calendar year.

(3) If during a calendar year the employee receives remuneration from more than one employer, the annual wage limitation does not apply to the aggregate remuneration received from all of such employers, but instead applies to the remuneration received during such calendar year from each employer with respect to employment after 1936. In such case the first remuneration received in any calendar year after 1974 up to the amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) (the first $13,200 received in 1974, the first $10,800 received in 1973, the first $9,000 received in 1972, the first $7,800 received in any calendar year after 1967 and before 1972, the first $6,600 received in any calendar year after 1965 and before 1968, the first $4,800 received in any calendar year after 1958 and before 1966, or the first $4,200 received in any calendar year after 1954 and before 1959) from each employer constitutes wages and is subject to the taxes, even though, under section 6413(c), the employee may be entitled to a special credit or refund of a portion of the employee tax deducted from his wages received during the calendar year. In this connection and in connection with the two examples immediately following, see § 31.6413(c)-1, relating to special credits or refunds of employee tax. In connection with the annual wage limitation in the case of remuneration paid for services performed in the employ of the United States or a wholly owned instrumentality thereof, see § 31.3122. In connection with the annual wage limitation in the case of remuneration paid for services performed in the employ of the Government of Guam, the Government of American Samoa, the District of Columbia, a political subdivision of the Government of Guam, or the Government of American Samoa, or any instrumentality of any of the foregoing which is wholly owned thereby, see § 31.3125. In connection with the application of the annual wage limitation, see also paragraph (b) of this section, relating to the circumstances under which wages paid by a predecessor employer are deemed to be paid by his successor. In connection with the annual wage limitation in the case of remuneration paid after December 31, 1978, from two or more related corporations that compensate an employee through a common paymaster, see § 31.3121(s)-1.
