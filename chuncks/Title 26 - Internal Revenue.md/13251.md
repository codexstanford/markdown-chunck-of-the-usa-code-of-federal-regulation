(B)-()Because all of DC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A and B is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI for Year 1, Asset A and Asset B are sole use partnership property within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is equal to the sum of DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1 and DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1, respectively.
