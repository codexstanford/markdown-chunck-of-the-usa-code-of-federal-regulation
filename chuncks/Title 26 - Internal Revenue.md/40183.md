()To compute CFC1X's tentative tested income items, the principles of § 1.960-1(d)(3) apply by treating each of CFC1X's tentative gross tested income items as income in a separate tested income group (the "CFC1X income group" and the "FDE1Y income group") and allocate and apportion its deductions among those income groups under federal income tax principles. Because CFC1X uses the modified gross income method under § 1.861-9(j) and § 1.861-9T(j) to allocate and apportion interest expense, it must allocate and apportion its interest expense between the CFC1X income group and the FDE1Y income group based on a combined gross income amount that includes both the gross income of CFC1X (including the gross income attributable to both the CFC1X tested unit and the FDE1Y tested unit) and the gross income of CFC3Z, adjusted as provided under § 1.861-9(j) and § 1.861-9T(j). Under § 1.861-9(j) and § 1.861-9T(j), the adjusted combined gross income of CFC1X comprises the CFC1X tentative gross tested income item (€3,000x), or 60% of the combined adjusted gross income amount, the FDE1Y tentative gross tested income item (€1,000x), or 20% of the combined adjusted gross income amount, and the CFC3Z gross tentative tested income item (€1,000x), or 20% of the combined adjusted gross income amount. Under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section, interest expense of CFC1X that is allocated and apportioned to the gross income of CFC3Z under § 1.861-9(j) and § 1.861-9T(j) is not allocated and apportioned to either the CFC1X income group or the FDE1Y income group. Therefore, €600x of interest expense (60% of the €1,000x of interest expense) is allocated and apportioned to the CFC1X income group, and €200x of interest expense (20% of the €1,000x of interest expense) is allocated and apportioned to the FDE1Y income group. The €200x of interest expense that is allocated and apportioned to the €1,000x of gross tentative tested income of CFC3Z is allocated and apportioned to the residual income group for purposes of paragraph (c)(7) of this section, but can still be allocated and apportioned to a statutory grouping of tested income of CFC1X for purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section.
