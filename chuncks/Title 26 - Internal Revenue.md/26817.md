A taxpayer that is an individual, estate, or trust may regroup its activities for any taxable year that begins during 2013, if the individual, estate, or trust meets the Eligibility Criteria for such year. A taxpayer may regroup activities only once pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(iv), and a regrouping made pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(iv) will apply to the taxable year for which the regrouping is done and all subsequent years.
