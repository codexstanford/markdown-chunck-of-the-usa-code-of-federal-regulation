####### Corporations.

(4)A receiver, trustee in dissolution, trustee in bankruptcy, or assignee, who, by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, by operation of law or otherwise, has possession of or holds title to all or substantially all the property or business of a corporation, shall make the return of income for such corporation in the same manner and form as corporations are required to make such returns. Such return shall be filed whether or not the receiver, trustee, or assignee is operating the property or business of the corporation. A receiver in charge of only a small part of the property of a corporation, such as a receiver in mortgage foreclosure proceedings involving merely a small portion of its property, need not make the return of income. See also § 1.6041-1, relating to returns regarding information at source; §§ 1.6042-1 to 1.6042-3, inclusive, relating to returns regarding payments of dividends; §§ 1.6044-1 to 1.6044-4, inclusive, relating to returns regarding payments of patronage dividends; and §§ 1.6049-1 and 1.6049-2, relating to returns regarding certain payments of interest.
