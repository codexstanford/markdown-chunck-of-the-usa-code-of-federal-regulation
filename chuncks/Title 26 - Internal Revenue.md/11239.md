(7)Solely for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6, the termmeans the first commercial exhibition or broadcast of a production to an audience. However, the term "initial release or broadcast" does not include limited exhibition prior to commercial exhibition to general audiences if the limited exhibition is primarily for purposes of publicity, marketing to potential purchasers or distributors, determining the need for further production activity, or raising funds for the completion of production. For example, the term initial release or broadcast does not include exhibition to a test audience to determine the need for further production activity, or exhibition at a film festival for promotional purposes, if the exhibition precedes commercial exhibition to general audiences.
