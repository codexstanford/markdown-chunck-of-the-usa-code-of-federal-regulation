####### Partnership interests.,2

(ii)If a REIT described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section holds an interest in a partnership, in applying the partnership look-through rule described in ยง 1.163(j)-10(c)(5)(ii)(A)(), the REIT treats assets of the partnership that meet the definition of real property under ยง 1.856-10 as assets of an excepted trade or business. This application of the definition of real property under ยง 1.856-10 does not affect the characterization of the partnership's assets at the partnership level or for any non-REIT partner. However, no portion of the adjusted basis of the REIT's interest in the partnership is allocated to a non-excepted trade or business if the partnership makes an election under paragraph (h)(7) of this section and if all of the partnership's assets are treated as assets of an excepted trade or business under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
