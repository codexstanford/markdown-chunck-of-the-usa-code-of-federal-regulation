()-()Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, FC is treated as conferring benefits on a person located within the United States to the extent that R's operations that will benefit from FC's service are located within the United States. Further, because FC's service confers a benefit on R's operations located within and outside the United States, the price paid by R to FC ($100x) is allocated proportionately based on the locations of R that benefit from the services provided by FC under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, because 10 percent of R's operations that will benefit from FC's services are located within the United States, persons located within the United States are treated as paying $10x ($100x x 0.10) for FC's services for purposes of applying the test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
