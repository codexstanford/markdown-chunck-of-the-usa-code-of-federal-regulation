###### § 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Positive basis in the deconsolidating QOF resulting from § 1.1502-32.

(ii)Consolidated group members retain any positive basis in the deconsolidating QOF resulting from investment adjustments under § 1.1502-32 following its deconsolidation. However, following the deconsolidation, for purposes of determining the amount includible under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e), the amount of basis referred to in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(A)(ii) is computed by applying only those rules applicable to corporations that do not file a consolidated return (that is, the basis rules under subchapter C and section 1400Z-2). Therefore, any positive basis resulting from § 1.1502-32 adjustments is not taken into account in computing the amount includable under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e).
