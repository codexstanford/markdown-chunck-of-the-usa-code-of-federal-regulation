(3)-(i)If the transaction price amount includes a reduction for amounts described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)() or () of this section, or has been reduced because a significant financing component is deemed to exist under the standards the taxpayer uses to prepare its AFS, the taxpayer must determine the specific performance obligation to which such reduction relates and increase the transaction price amount allocable to the corresponding item of gross income by the amount of such reduction (specific identification approach). If it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to use the specific identification approach, the taxpayer may use any reasonable method to allocate the reduction amount to the items of gross income in the contract. A pro-rata allocation of the reduction amount across all items of gross income under the contract based on the relative transaction price amounts allocated to such items under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is a reasonable method.
