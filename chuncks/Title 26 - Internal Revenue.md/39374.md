(ii) For purposes of the U.S. statute of limitations under section 6501(a), an income tax return filed with the Virgin Islands by an individual who takes the position that he or she is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section (or an individual who files a joint return with such an individual under paragraph (d) of this section) will be deemed to be a U.S. income tax return, provided that the United States and the Virgin Islands have entered into an agreement for the routine exchange of income tax information satisfying the requirements of the Commissioner. The working arrangement announced in Notice 2007-31 satisfies the condition of the preceding sentence. See Notice 2007-31 (2007-16 IRB 971) (applicable to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2006, unless and until arrangement terminates). In the absence of such an agreement, individuals to whom this paragraph (c) applies generally must file an income tax return for the taxable year with the United States to begin the period of limitations for Federal income tax purposes as provided in section 6501(a), and in such circumstances the Commissioner may by revenue procedure, notice, or other administrative pronouncement specify U.S. filing and other information reporting requirements for such individuals. For taxable years ending before December 31, 2006, the rules provided in section 3 of Notice 2007-19 (2007-11 IRB 689) will apply. See ยง 601.601(d)(2)(ii)().
