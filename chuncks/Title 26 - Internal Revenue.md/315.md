####### Allocation of common costs. Costs for developing and making available the designated drug for both the disease or condition for which it is designated and one or more other diseases or conditions.,i.e.,

(D)In the case where the costs incurred or expected to be incurred in developing and making available the designated drug for the disease or condition for which it is designated are also incurred or expected to be incurred in developing and making available in the United States the same drug for one or more other diseases or conditions (whether or not they are also designated or expected to be designated), the costs shall be allocated between the cost of developing and making available the designated drug for the disease or condition for which the drug is designated and the cost of developing and making available the designated drug for the other diseases or conditions. The amount of the common costs to be allocated to the cost of developing and making available the designated drug for the disease or condition for which it is designated is determined by multiplying the common costs by a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of the expected amount of sales in the United States of the designated drug for the disease or condition for which the drug is designated and the denominator of which is the total expected amount of sales in the United States of the designated drug. For example, if prior to designation, the taxpayer incurs (among other costs) costs of $100,000 in testing the designated drug for its toxic effect on animals (without reference to any disease or condition), and if the taxpayer expects to recover $500,000 from sales in the United States of the designated drug for disease X, the disease for which the drug is designated, and further expects to recover another $1.5 million from the sales in the United States of the designated drug for disease Y, the taxpayer must allocate a proportionate amount of the common costs of $100,000 to the cost of developing and making available the designated drug for both disease X and disease Y. Since the ratio of the expected amount of sales in the United States of the designated drug for disease X to the total of both the expected amount of sales in the United States of the designated drug for disease X and the expected amount of sales in the United States of the designated drug for disease Y is $500,000/$2,000,000, 25% of the common costs of $100,000 ($25,000) is allocated to the cost of developing and making available the designated drug for disease X.
