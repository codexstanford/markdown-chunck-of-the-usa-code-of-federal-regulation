####### Actual use.

(2)(i) A single purpose agricultural or horticultural structure also must actually be used for the permissible purpose by reason of which it qualifies for the credit. "Actual use" means "placed in service" (as defined in ยง 1.46-3(d)). Mere vacancy, on a temporary basis, will not disqualify the structure. Thus, for example, a structure that is designed and constructed as a hog-raising structure will not qualify if it is never placed in service for raising hogs. However, a turkey-raising facility will not be disqualified if the turkeys are all sent to a packing plant in November and the structure remains vacant until the next spring when newly hatched turkeys are placed in the structure to be raised.

(ii) For purposes of this section, "vacancy on a temporary basis" includes temporary vacancy caused by market fluctuations or other economic considerations and vacancy on a seasonal basis.
