No. A taxpayer is precluded from raising a spousal defense at a CDP hearing when the Commissioner has made a final determination (under section 66 or section 6015) as to spousal defenses in a final determination letter or statutory notice of deficiency. However, a taxpayer may raise spousal defenses in a CDP hearing when the taxpayer has previously raised spousal defenses, but the Commissioner has not yet made a final determination regarding this issue.
