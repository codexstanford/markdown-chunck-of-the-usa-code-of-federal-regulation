##### ยง 1.402(c)-3 Eligible rollover distributions; Qualified plan loan offsets.
###### 2,Example 1

() The conclusion is the same as in paragraph (a)(2)(v)(A) of this section (), except that the $3,000 plan loan offset amount is not a qualified plan loan offset amount (because the offset did not occur within the 12-month period beginning on the date that Employee A severed from employment). Accordingly, Employee A may roll over up to the $3,000 plan loan offset amount to an eligible retirement plan within the 60-day period provided in section 402(c)(3)(A) (rather than within the period that ends on Employee A's tax filing due date (including extensions) for the taxable year in which the offset occurs).
