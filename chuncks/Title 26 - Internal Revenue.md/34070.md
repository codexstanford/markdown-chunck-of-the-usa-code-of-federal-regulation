###### ยง 1.856-8 Revocation or termination of election.
####### Effective date.

(3)Section 856(g)(3) does not apply to the termination of an election that was made by a taxpayer pursuant to section 856(c)(1) on or before October 4, 1976, unless the taxpayer is a qualified real estate investment trust for a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, for which the pre-October 5, 1976, election is in effect. For example, assume that Trust X, a calendar year taxpayer, files a timely election under section 856(c)(1) with respect to its taxable year 1974, and is a qualified real estate investment trust for calendar years 1974 and 1975. Assume further that Trust X is not a qualified real estate investment trust for 1976 and 1977 because it willfully fails to meet the asset diversification requirements of section 856(c)(5) for both years. The failure (whether or not willful) to meet these requirements in 1977 terminates the election to be a real estate investment trust made with respect to 1974. (See paragraph (b) of this section.) The termination is effective for 1977 and all succeeding taxable years. However, under section 1608(d)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Trust X is not prohibited by section 856(g)(3) from making a new election under section 856(c)(1) with respect to 1978.
