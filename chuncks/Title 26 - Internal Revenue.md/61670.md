# Title 26 - Internal Revenue
## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 15 - TEMPORARY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS RELATING TO EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN THE CASE OF MINING
##### ยง 15.1-1 Elections to deduct.
###### Exception.

(ii)The last sentence of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply if all mining exploration expenditures which are paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and which are deducted by him in his income tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, during which he pays or incurs such expenditures are outside the scope of section 617(a). For example, assume that, in his return for his first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, a taxpayer deducts mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and does not attach to his return the statement described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. However, all of the exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and before the end of the taxable year were paid or incurred with respect to minerals located neither in the United States nor on the Outer Continental Shelf. The taxpayer will be deemed to have made an election under section 615(e) by deducting all or part of those expenditures as expenses in his income tax return.
