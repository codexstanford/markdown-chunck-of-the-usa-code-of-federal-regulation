###### ยง 1.861-8 Computation of taxable income from sources within the United States and from other sources and activities.
####### Apportionment.

(B)For purposes of computing the foreign tax credit limitation, USP's income is comprised of one statutory grouping, foreign source foreign branch category gross income, and one residual grouping, gross income from sources within the United States. The state income tax deduction of $69,000x must be apportioned between these two groupings. Corporation USP calculates the apportionment on the basis of the relative amounts of foreign source foreign branch category taxable income and U.S. source taxable income subject to state taxation. In this case, state income taxes are presumed to be imposed on $800,000x of domestic source income and $150,000x of foreign source general category income.
