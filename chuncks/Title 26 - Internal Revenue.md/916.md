####### Inspection standard.

(2)For the on-site inspections of buildings and low-income units required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the Agency must review any local health, safety, or building code violations reports or notices retained by the owner under paragraph (b)(3) of this section and must determine-

(i) Whether the buildings and units are suitable for occupancy, taking into account local health, safety, and building codes (or other habitability standards); or

(ii) Whether the buildings and units satisfy, as determined by the Agency, the uniform physical condition standards for public housing established by HUD (24 CFR 5.703). The HUD physical condition standards do not supersede or preempt local health, safety, and building codes. A low-income housing project under section 42 must continue to satisfy these codes and, if the Agency becomes aware of any violation of these codes, the Agency must report the violation to the Service. However, provided the Agency determines by inspection that the HUD standards are met, the Agency is not required under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) to determine by inspection whether the project meets local health, safety, and building codes.
