(iii) An electing taxpayer can maintain only one nuclear decommissioning fund for each nuclear power plant with respect to which the taxpayer elects the application of section 468A. If a nuclear power plant is subject to the ratemaking jurisdiction of two or more public utility commissions and any such public utility commission requires a separate fund to be maintained for the benefit of ratepayers whose rates are established or approved by the public utility commission, the separate funds maintained for such plant (whether or not established and maintained pursuant to a single trust agreement) shall be considered a single nuclear decommissioning fund for purposes of section 468A and §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-4, this section and §§ 1.468A-7 through 1.468A-9. Thus, for example, the IRS will issue one schedule of ruling amounts with respect to such nuclear power plant, the nuclear decommissioning fund must file a single income tax return (§ 1.468A-4(d)(1)), and, if the IRS disqualifies the nuclear decommissioning fund, the assets of each separate fund are treated as distributed on the date of disqualification (paragraph (c)(3) of this section).

(iv) If assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund are (or will be) invested through an unincorporated organization, within the meaning of § 301.7701-2 of this chapter, the IRS will rule, if requested, whether the organization is an association taxable as a corporation for Federal tax purposes. A request for this ruling may be made by the electing taxpayer as part of its request for a schedule of ruling amounts or as part of a request under § 1.468A-8 for a schedule of deduction amounts.
