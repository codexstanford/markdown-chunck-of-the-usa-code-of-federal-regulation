####### Example 3: Addition of a fallback waterfall that is a qualified rate,1,Facts.,1,Example 1

(C)-()The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)() of this section (), except that the new fallbacks provide for a fallback waterfall. The first tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of six-month USD LIBOR, six-month USD LIBOR will be replaced by a fallback rate equal to six-month CME Term SOFR plus a fixed spread that will be determined at the time of six-month USD LIBOR's discontinuation. The second tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of six-month CME Term SOFR, B will select a replacement for the fallback rate in the first tier of the fallback waterfall based on the industry standard at the time of selection. At the time of the fallback waterfall's addition, the likelihood that six-month CME Term SOFR will be discontinued is remote.
