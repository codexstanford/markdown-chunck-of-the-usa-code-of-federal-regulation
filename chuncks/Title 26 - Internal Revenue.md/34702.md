()Under paragraph (e)(8)(iii) of this section, because the loan from US1 to Bank is made with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules of this paragraph (e)(8), the rules of this paragraph (e)(8) apply as if the loan by US1 to Bank was made directly to PRS. Accordingly, the loan by US1 to Bank is a downstream partnership loan and US1 is a DPL lender. Under paragraph (e)(8)(vi)(B) of this section, the matching income amount is $140x, the lesser of the DPL interest income included by US1 with respect to the loan for the taxable year ($150x) and US1's distributive share of the DPL interest expense ($140x). Under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, US1 assigns $126x of the DPL interest income to U.S. source income and $14x of the DPL interest income to foreign source foreign branch category income. The source and separate category of the remaining $10x of US1's DPL interest income is determined under the generally applicable rules. Under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, the disregarded portion of the downstream partnership loan is $2,800x ($3,000x x $140x/$150x).
