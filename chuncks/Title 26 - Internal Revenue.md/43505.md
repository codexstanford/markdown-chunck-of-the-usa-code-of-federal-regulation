(v)() In lieu of establishing an account receivable in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for all or part of an amount due a related supplier, the related supplier and DISC are permitted to treat all or part of any distribution which was made by the DISC out of its previously taxed income with respect to the year to which the determination or redetermination relates as an additional payment of transfer price or repayment of commission (and not as a distribution) made as of the date the distribution was made. Any additional amount arising on the determination or redetermination due the related supplier after this treatment shall be represented by an account receivable established under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. To the extent that a distribution is so treated under this subdivision (v), it shall cease to qualify as distribution for any Federal income tax purpose, and the DISC's account for previously taxed income shall be adjusted accordingly. If all or part of any distribution made to a shareholder other than the related supplier is recharacterized under this subdivision (v), the related supplier shall establish an account receivable from that shareholder for the amount so recharacterized. Such account receivable shall be paid in the time and manner set forth in this paragraph (e)(5). In order to obtain the relief provided by this subdivision (v), the conditions and procedures prescribed by Revenue Procedure 84-3 must be met. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(5)(v) shall apply to all open taxable years ending after December 31, 1971.
