####### Agreements with other parties.

(10)With the exception of sales described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if a hospital facility sells or refers an individual's debt related to care to another party, the hospital facility will have made reasonable efforts to determine whether the individual is FAP-eligible for the care only if it first enters into (and, to the extent applicable, enforces) a legally binding written agreement with the party that is reasonably designed to ensure that no ECAs are taken to obtain payment for the care until reasonable efforts have been made to determine whether the individual is FAP-eligible for the care. At a minimum, such an agreement must provide the following:

(i) If the individual submits a FAP application after the referral or sale of the debt but before the end of the application period, the party will suspend ECAs to obtain payment for the care as described in paragraph (c)(8) of this section.

(ii) If the individual submits a FAP application after the referral or sale of the debt but before the end of the application period and is determined to be FAP-eligible for the care, the party will do the following in a timely manner:

(A) Adhere to procedures specified in the agreement that ensure that the individual does not pay, and has no obligation to pay, the party and the hospital facility together more than he or she is required to pay for the care as a FAP-eligible individual.
