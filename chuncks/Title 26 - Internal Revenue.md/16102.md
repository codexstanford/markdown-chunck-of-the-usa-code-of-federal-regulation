####### Liabilities of old Target,In general.

(d)-(1)In general, the liabilities of old Target are measured as of the beginning of the day after the disposition date. However, if a Target for which a section 336(e) election is made engages in a transaction outside the ordinary course of business on the disposition date after the event resulting in the qualified stock disposition of Target or a higher-tier corporation, Target and all persons related thereto (either before or after the qualified stock disposition) under section 267(b) or section 707 must treat the transaction for all Federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the day following the transaction and after the deemed disposition by old Target. In order to be taken into account in ADADP, a liability must be a liability of Target that is properly taken into account in amount realized under general principles of tax law that would apply if old Target had sold its assets to an unrelated person for consideration that included the discharge of its liabilities. See ยง 1.1001-2(a). Such liabilities may include liabilities for the tax consequences resulting from the deemed asset disposition.
