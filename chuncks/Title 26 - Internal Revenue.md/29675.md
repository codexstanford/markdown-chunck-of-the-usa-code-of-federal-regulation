(a)-(1)(i) In computing undistributed personal holding company income for any taxable year, there shall be allowed as a deduction the amount by which Federal income and excess profits taxes accrued during the taxable year exceed the credit provided by section 33 (relating to taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States), and the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States accrued during the taxable year (to the extent provided by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph), except that no deduction shall be allowed for () the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531 (or a corresponding section of a prior law), () the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541 (or a corresponding section of a prior law), and () the excess profits tax imposed by subchapter E, chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1940. The deduction is for taxes for the taxable year, determined under the accrual method of accounting, regardless of whether the corporation uses an accrual method of accounting, the cash receipts and disbursement method, or any other allowable method of accounting. In computing the amount of taxes accrued, an unpaid tax which is being contested is not considered accrued until the contest is resolved.

(ii) However, the taxpayer shall deduct taxes paid, rather than taxes accrued, if it used that method with respect to Federal taxes for each taxable year for which it was subject to the tax imposed by section 500 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, unless an election is made under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to deduct taxes accrued.
