()CFC1's holding of Asset B as of the November 30, Year 1 tested quarter close does not satisfy the safe harbor under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section because the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section are not satisfied. Because CFC1 held Asset B for less than 12 months (from October 30, Year 1, until December 30, Year 1), the presumption in paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(A) of this section applies such that CFC1 is presumed to have held Asset B temporarily with a principal purpose of increasing the deemed tangible income return of USP for the taxable year, and the facts and circumstances do not clearly establish that CFC1 did not acquire Asset B with a principal purpose of increasing the deemed tangible income return of USP. Because CFC1 holds Asset B as of November 30, Year 1, the adjusted basis in Asset B would be, without regard to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, taken into account for purposes of determining USP's deemed tangible income return for its Year 1 taxable year as of two quarter closes (CFC1's quarter close on November 30, Year 1, and CFC2's quarter close on December 31, Year 1). If instead CFC2 had acquired Asset B directly from R, the adjusted basis in Asset B would have been taken into account for purposes of determining USP's deemed tangible income return for its Year 1 taxable year as of only one quarter close (CFC2's quarter close on December 31, Year 1). Accordingly, under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis in Asset B is disregarded in determining CFC1's aggregate adjusted basis in specified tangible property as of November 30, Year 1.
