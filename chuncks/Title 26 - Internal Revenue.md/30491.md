####### Transfer after election by transferee.

(c)(1) If a transferee who makes an election under section 617(a) receives before January 1, 1970, mineral property in a transaction in which the basis of such property in his hands is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor and the transferor had in effect at the time of the transfer an election under section 615(e), an amount equal to the total of the amounts allowed as deductions to the transferor under section 615 with respect to the transferred mineral property shall be treated as expenditures allowed as deductions under section 617(a) to the transferee. The preceding sentence shall not apply to expenditures which would not have been reflected in the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor had the transferor not made the section 615(e) election.

(2) Any expenditures with respect to the transferred property deferred by the transferor under section 615(b) which are not allowed as deductions to him prior to transfer of the property may not be deducted by the transferee and in his hands shall be charged to capital account.
