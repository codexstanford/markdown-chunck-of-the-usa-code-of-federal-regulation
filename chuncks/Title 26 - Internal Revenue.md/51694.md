####### Active NFFEs.

(iv)A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) (and thus constitutes an active NFFE) if it is an entity and for the preceding calendar or fiscal year less than 50 percent of its gross income is passive income and the weighted average of the percentage of assets held by it that produce or are held for the production of passive income (weighted by total assets and measured quarterly) is less than 50 percent, as determined after the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section (passive assets). For purposes of the calculations described in the preceding sentence, a NFFE may use any accounting method permitted under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) of this section but must apply a uniform method for measuring assets for the calendar or fiscal year.
