####### Deduction for amounts allocated from income not derived from patronage.,income not derived from patronage

(d)There is allowable as a deduction from the gross income of a cooperative association operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and ยง 1.521-1 amounts allocated during the taxable year to patrons with respect to its income not derived from patronage (whether or not such income was derived during such taxable year) whether such amounts are paid in cash, merchandise, capital stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice, or in some other manner that discloses to each patron the dollar amount allocated to him. For this purpose, allocations made after the close of the taxable year and on or before the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year shall be considered as made on the last day of such taxable year to the extent that such allocations are attributable toincome derived during the taxable year or during years prior to the taxable year. As used in this paragraph, the termmeans incidental income derived from sources not directly related to the marketing, purchasing, or service activities of the cooperative association. For example, income derived from the lease of premises, from investment in securities, from the sale or exchange of capital assets, constitutes income not derived from patronage. Business done with the United States shall constitute income not derived from patronage. In order that the deduction for income not derived from patronage may be applicable, it is necessary that the amount sought to be deducted be allocated on a patronage basis in proportion, insofar as is practicable, to the amount of business done by or for patrons during the period to which such income is attributable. Thus, if capital gains are realized from the sale or exchange of capital assets acquired and disposed of during the taxable year, income realized from such gains must be allocated to patrons of such year in proportion to theamount of business done by such patrons during the taxable year. Similarly, if capital gains are realized by the association from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for a period of more than one taxable year income realized from such gains must be allocated, in proportion insofar as is practicable, to the patrons of the taxable years during which the asset was owned by the association, and to the amount of business done by such patrons during such taxable years.
