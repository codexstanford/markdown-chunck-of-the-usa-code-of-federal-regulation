####### Analysis.

(ii)Under §§ 1.1502-13(f)(2) and 1.1502-32, the intercompany distribution from Q2 to S of $20x reduces S's basis in Q2 to $30x ($50x-$20x). Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, because the distribution does not create or increase an ELA in Q2 stock, the distribution is not an inclusion event.
