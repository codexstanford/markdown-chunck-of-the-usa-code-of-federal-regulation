() Deductions, including those that create or increase a net operating loss for the taxable year by reason of the section 965(n) election, are allocated and apportioned under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-17 to the relevant statutory and residual groupings, taking into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. The source and separate category of the net operating loss carryover or carryback to the taxable year, if any, is determined under the rules of § 1.904(g)-3(b), taking into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Therefore, if the amount of the net operating loss carryover or carryback to the taxable year (as reduced by reason of the section 965(n) election) exceeds the U.S. source loss component of the net operating loss that is carried over under § 1.904(g)-3(b)(3)(i), but such excess is less than the potential carryovers (or carrybacks) of the separate limitation losses that are part of the net operating loss, the potential carryovers (or carrybacks) are proportionately reduced as provided in § 1.904(g)-3(b)(3)(ii) or (iii), as applicable.
