####### 4,Transfer of assets in a nonrecognition transaction to which section 351 applies.,1,1,1,1,4,1

()The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(A)() of this section, except that, rather than sell Asset X to an unrelated third party in 2024, A transfers Asset X to B (A's wholly owned subsidiary) in 2024 in a transaction to which section 351 applies. The section 351 transaction is treated as a "sale or other disposition" for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(C) and (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section, and it is treated as a taxable disposition for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section. See paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A)() and () of this section. However, the negative adjustments under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(C) and (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section are both subject to the negative adjustment cap in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(F) of this section. Thus, A must subtract $20x from its tentative taxable income in computing its ATI for its 2024 taxable year.
