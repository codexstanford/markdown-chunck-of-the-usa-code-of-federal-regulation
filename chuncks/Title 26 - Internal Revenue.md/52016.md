####### Computation of penalty on consolidated basis.

(2)(i) This paragraph (b)(2) gives the rules for computing the penalty under section 6655 on a consolidated basis.

(ii) The tax and facts shown on the return for the preceding taxable year referred to in section 6655(d) (1) and (2) are, if a consolidated return was filed for that preceding year, such items shown on the consolidated return for that preceding year or, if one was not filed for that preceding year, the aggregate taxes and the facts shown on the separate returns of the common parent and any other corporation that was a member of the same affiliated group as the common parent for that preceding year.

(iii) If estimated tax was not paid on a consolidated basis, then the amount of the group's payments of estimated tax for the taxable year is the aggregate of the payments made by all members for the year.

(iv) Section 6655(d)(1) applies only if the common parent's consolidated return, or each member's separate return, for the preceding taxable year (as the case may be) was a taxable year of 12 months.
