() The numerator of the fraction equals the interest, other than original issue discount, allocable to the accrual period. The denominator of the fraction equals the interest, other than original issue discount, allocable to the accrual period plus the remaining interest, other than original issue discount, as of the end of that accrual period. The interest allocable to each accrual period and the remaining interest are calculated by taking into account events which have occurred before the close of the accrual period and the prepayment assumption, if any, determined as of the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9)) of the REMIC or the issue date (as defined in section 1275(a)(2)) of the collateralized debt obligaition that would be made in computing original issue discount if the debt instrument had been issued with original issue discount.
