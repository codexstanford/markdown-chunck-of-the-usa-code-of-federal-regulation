####### Example 7: Diverted Profits Tax,Facts.

(vii)-(A)Country X imposes a 20% net income tax ("Income Tax") and a 25% "Diverted Profits Tax" on nonresident corporations. Under Country X tax law, taxable income under the Diverted Profits Tax is determined first by attributing gross receipts of the nonresident corporation to a hypothetical permanent establishment in Country X. Country X applies the same computational rules that apply under the Income Tax to determine the taxable income attributable to a hypothetical permanent establishment under the Diverted Profits Tax.
