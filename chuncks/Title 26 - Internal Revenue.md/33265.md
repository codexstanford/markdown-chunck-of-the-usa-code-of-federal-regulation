() From the compulsory or involuntary conversion (as a result of destruction, in whole or in part, theft or seizure, or an exercise of the power of requisition or condemnation or the threat or imminence thereof) of property used in the trade or business (as so defined).

(iii) Any item, to the extent attributable to the carrying on of the insurance business, shall not be taken into account. For example, if a life insurance company operates a radio station primarily to advertise its own insurance services, a portion of the expenses of the radio station shall not be allowed as a deduction. The portion disallowed shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total expenses of the station as the value of advertising furnished to the insurance company bears to the total value of services rendered by the station.

(iv) The deduction for net operating losses provided in section 172, and the special deductions for corporations provided in part VIII, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, shall not be allowed.
