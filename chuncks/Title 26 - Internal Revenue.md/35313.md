####### 2,Attribution of U.S. gross income to a taxable unit.,2,1,1,1,2

()This paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)() provides attribution rules to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the statutory and residual groupings in order to apply paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)() of this section to assign foreign gross income items arising from a reattribution payment to the groupings. In the case of a taxpayer that is an individual or a domestic corporation, the attribution rules in § 1.904-4(f)(2) apply to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the separate categories (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v)) in order to apply paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)() of this section for purposes of § 1.904-6(b)(2)(i). In the case of a taxpayer that is a foreign corporation, the attribution rules in § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B) apply to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the statutory and residual groupings in order to apply paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)() of this section for purposes of §§ 1.951A-2(c)(3), 1.951A-2(c)(7), and 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii). For purposes of other operative sections (as described in § 1.861-8(f)(1)), the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) or § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B), as applicable, apply to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the statutory and residual groupings. The rules and principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) or § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B), as applicable, apply to determine the extent to which a disregarded payment made by the taxable unit is a reattribution payment and the reattribution amounts that constitute a reattribution payment, and to adjust the U.S. gross income initially attributed to each taxable unit to reflect the reattribution payments that the taxable unit makes and receives. The rules in this paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)() limit the amount of a disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment to the U.S. gross income of the payor taxable unit that is recognized in the U.S. taxable year in which the disregarded payment is made.
