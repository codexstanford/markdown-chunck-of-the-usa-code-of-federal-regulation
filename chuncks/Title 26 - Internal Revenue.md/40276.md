FC3 has an adjusted basis of $50x in its partnership interest. PRS has a section 754 election in effect.

Asset H and Asset J are tangible property, but Asset I is not tangible property. PRS distributes Asset I to FC3 in liquidation of FC3's interest in PRS. None of FC1, FC2, FC3, or PRS recognizes gain on the distribution. Under section 732(b), FC3's adjusted basis in Asset I is $50x. PRS's adjusted basis in Asset H is increased by $50x to $50x under section 734(b)(1)(B), which is the amount by which PRS's adjusted basis in Asset I immediately before the distribution exceeds FC3's adjusted basis in Asset I.
