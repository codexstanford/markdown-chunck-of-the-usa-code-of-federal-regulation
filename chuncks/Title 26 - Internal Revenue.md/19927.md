####### Employer-provided benefits under the general test.

(C)For purposes of applying the general test of § 1.401(a)(4)-3(c) with respect to employer-provided benefits, an employee's normal and most valuable accrual rates otherwise determined under § 1.401(a)(4)-3(d) (without applying any of the options under § 1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(3) other than the fresh-start alternative of § 1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(3)(iii)) are each reduced by subtracting the product of the employee's contributions (expressed as a percentage of plan year compensation) and the factor determined under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section from the respective accrual rates. A plan may then apply the optional rules in § 1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(3) (i) and (ii) to this resulting accrual rate.
