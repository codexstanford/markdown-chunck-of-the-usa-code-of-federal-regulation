##### Pension, Profit-Sharing, Stock Bonus Plans, etc.
###### ยง 1.401(a)(4)-3 Nondiscrimination in amount of employer-provided benefits under a defined benefit plan.
####### Section 401(l) permitted disparity.

(ii)The plan takes permitted disparity into account in a manner that satisfies section 401(l) in form. Thus, differences in employees' benefits under the plan attributable to uniform disparities permitted under ยง 1.401(l)-3 (including differences in disparities that are deemed uniform under ยง 1.401(l)-3(c)(2)) do not cause a plan to fail to satisfy this paragraph (b).
