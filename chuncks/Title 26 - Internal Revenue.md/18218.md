###### ยง 1.381(c)(1)-1 Net operating loss carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
####### Division of taxable income.

(5)The taxable income for such taxable year (computed with the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) but without any net operating loss deduction) of the acquiring corporation shall be divided between the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year in proportion to the number of days in each. Thus, if in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies Y Corporation acquires the assets of X Corporation on June 30, 1960, and Y Corporation has taxable income (computed in the manner so prescribed) of $36,600 for its calendar year 1960, then the preacquisition part year taxable income would be $18,200 ($36,600 x 182/366) and the postacquisition part year taxable income would be $18,400 ($36,600 x 184/366).
