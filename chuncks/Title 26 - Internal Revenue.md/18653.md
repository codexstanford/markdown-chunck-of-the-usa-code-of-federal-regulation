###### ยง 1.382-2T Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary).
####### Ownership interest structured to avoid the section 382 limitation.

(4)For purposes of this section, if the ownership interests in a loss corporation are structured by a person with a direct or indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation to avoid treating a person as a 5-percent shareholder (or to permit the loss corporation to rely on the presumption provided in paragraph (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section) for a principal purpose of circumventing the section 382 limitation, then-

(i) Paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section shall not apply with respect to the ownership interests so structured and the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section shall thus apply to attribute stock from any entity without regard to the amount of stock it owns in the loss corporation or any other corporation,

(ii) Paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section shall be modified with respect to the ownership interests so structured so that the ownership interest of a person includes all of an individual's direct and indirect ownership in the loss corporation, without regard to whether each such interest represents five percent or more of the stock of the loss corporation, and

(iii) Paragraph (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section shall not apply with respect to the ownership interests so structured so that the ownership interest of a person takes into account his actual ownership interest in the loss corporation.
