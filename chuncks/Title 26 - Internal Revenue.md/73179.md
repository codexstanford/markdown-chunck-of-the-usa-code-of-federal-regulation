####### ยง 301.6226-3 Adjustments taken into account by partners.
######## Affected partner must take into account the adjustments.

(iv)A statement furnished to an affected partner in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section is treated as if it were a statement described in ยง 301.6226-2. An affected partner that is a pass-through partner must take into account the adjustments reflected on such a statement in accordance with this paragraph (e). An affected partner that is not a pass-through partner must take into account the adjustments reflected on such a statement in accordance with this section by treating references to "reviewed year partner" as "affected partner". For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv), an affected partner that is not a pass-through partner takes into account the adjustments in accordance with this section by determining its reporting year based on the date upon which the audited partnership furnished its statements to its reviewed year partners (as described in paragraph (a) of this section). No addition to tax under section 6651 related to any additional reporting year tax will be imposed if an affected partner that is not a pass-through partner reports and pays the additional reporting year tax within 30 days of the extended due date for the return for the adjustment year of the audited partnership (as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section).
