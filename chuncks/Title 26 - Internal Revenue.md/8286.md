###### ยง 1.163(j)-6 Application of the section 163(j) limitation to partnerships and subchapter S corporations.
####### Partner-level allocations.

(iii)Because PRS's business interest expense is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation, such business interest expense is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the level of either the partnership or partner. Additionally, pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-6(m)(1), each partner includes its share of non-excepted trade or business items of income, gain, loss, and deduction (including business interest expense and business interest income) of PRS when calculating its ATI. Therefore, each partner increases its ATI by $10 (each partner's share of $20 of non-excepted income less each partner's share of $10 of non-excepted loss).
