###### ยง 1.826-1 Election by reciprocal underwriters and interinsurers.
####### In general.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in section 826(c), any mutual insurance company which is an interinsurer or reciprocal underwriter taxable under section 821(a) may elect under section 826(a) to limit its deductions for amounts paid or incurred to its attorney-in-fact to the deductions of its attorney-in-fact which are allocable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal during the taxable year. See ยง 1.826-4 for rules relating to allocation of expenses. In no case may such an election increase the amount deductible by the reciprocal for amounts paid or due its attorney-in-fact for the taxable year. The election allowed by section 826(a) and this section in effect increases the income of the reciprocal by the net income of the attorney-in-fact attributable to its business with the reciprocal. A reciprocal making the election is allowed a credit for the amount of tax paid by the attorney-in-fact for the taxable year which is attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal. See section 826(e) and ยง 1.826-5.
