(3)The estimated gross income from fishing is the estimated income resulting from the catching, taking, harvesting, cultivating or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish (for example, clams and mussels), crustacea (for example, lobsters, crabs, and shrimps), sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life. The estimated gross income from fishing includes the income expected to be received by an officer or member of the crew of a vessel while the vessel is engaged in any such activity, whether or not the officer or member of the crew is himself so engaged, and, in the case of an individual who is engaged in any such activity in the employ of any person, the income expected to be received by such individual from such employment. In addition, income expected to be received for services performed as an ordinary incident to any such activity is estimated gross income from fishing. Similarly, for example, the estimated gross income from fishing includes income expected to be received from the shore services of an officer or member of the crew of a vessel engaged in any such activity, if such services are an ordinary incident to any such activity. Services performed as an ordinary incident to such activities include, for example, services performed in such cleaning, icing, and packing of fish as are necessary for the immediate preservation of the catch.
