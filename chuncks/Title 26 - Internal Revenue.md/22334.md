####### Determining the employees of a qualified separate line of business.

(3)In order to apply certain provisions under these regulations, it is necessary to determine the employees of a qualified separate line of business. For these purposes, the employees of a qualified separate line of business consist of all employees who are substantial-service employees with respect to the qualified separate line of business, and all other employees who are assigned to the qualified separate line of business. Rules for making these determinations are provided in ยง 1.414(r)-7. These rules apply solely for the purposes specified in these regulations (see ยง 1.414(r)-7(a)(2) for a comprehensive listing of these purposes). These rules do not apply for any other purpose (e.g., the determination under ยง 1.414(r)-3 of whether a line of business is organized and operated separately from the remainder of the employer).
