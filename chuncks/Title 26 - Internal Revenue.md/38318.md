(E)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section (the facts in), except that CFC uses the modified gross income method to apportion interest expense. As in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section (), $100x of the interest payment to USP is allocated to passive category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the additional $50x of related person interest expense is apportioned to general category income ($150x-100x x $100x/$100x). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, none of the unrelated person interest expense and none of the G & A is apportioned to passive category income, because after the application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, no income remains in the passive category.
