####### Covered debt instrument treated as stock that leaves the expanded group,Events that cause a covered debt instrument to cease to be treated as stock.

(2)-(i)Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, this paragraph (d)(2)(i) applies with respect to a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under this section when the holder and issuer of a covered debt instrument cease to be members of the same expanded group, either because the covered debt instrument is transferred to a person that is not a member of the expanded group that includes the issuer or because the holder or the issuer ceases to be a member of the same expanded group, or in the case of a holder that is a controlled partnership, when the holder ceases to be a controlled partnership with respect to the expanded group of which the issuer is a member, either because the partnership ceases to be a controlled partnership or because the issuer ceases to be a member of the same expanded group with respect to which the holder is a controlled partnership. In such a case, the covered debt instrument ceases to be treated as stock under this section. For this purpose, immediately before the transaction that causes the holder and issuer of the covered debt instrument to cease to be members of the same expanded group, or, if the holder is a controlled partnership, that causes the holder to cease to be a controlled partnership with respect to the expanded group of which the issuer is a member, the issuer is deemed to issue a new covered debt instrument to the holder in exchange for the covered debt instrument that was treated as stock in a transaction that is disregarded for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
