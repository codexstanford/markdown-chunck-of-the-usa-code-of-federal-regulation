####### Transfers for less than fair market value.

(h)If property is transferred by a corporation to a shareholder for an amount less than its fair market value in a sale or exchange, such shareholder is treated as having received a distribution to which section 301 applies. In such case, the amount of the distribution is the excess of the fair market value of the property over the amount paid for such property at the time of the transfer. For example, on January 3, 2021, A, a shareholder of Corporation X, purchased property from X for $20 when the fair market value of such property was $100. The amount of the distribution to A determined under section 301(b) is $80.
