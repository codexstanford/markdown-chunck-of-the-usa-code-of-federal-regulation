(4)(i) If a special transfer is made to any qualified nuclear decommissioning fund, there is a subsequent transfer of the fund or the assets of the fund (a fund transfer), and ยง 1.468-6 applies to the fund transfer, any amount of the deduction under paragraph (b) of this section allocable to taxable years ending after the date of the fund transfer will be allowed as a current deduction to the transferor for the taxable year that includes the date of the fund transfer.ยง 468A-6(c) for additional rules concerning transfers of decommissioning funds, including the transfer of a portion of the taxpayer's interest in a nuclear power plant. If a taxpayer transfers only part of the fund or the fund's assets, the rules in this paragraph (b)(4) apply only to the corresponding portion of the deduction under paragraph (b) of this section.

(ii) If a deduction is allowed to the transferor under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section and the transferee is related to the transferor, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not approve the transferee's schedule of ruling amounts for taxable years beginning after the date of the transfer unless the ruling amounts are deferred in a manner that results in recapture of the acceleration amount. For this purpose-

(A) The acceleration amount is the difference between the deduction allowed under this paragraph (b)(4) and the present value as of the beginning of the acceleration period of the deductions that, but for the transfer, would have been allowed under this paragraph (b) for taxable years during the acceleration period;

(B) The acceleration amount is recaptured if the aggregate present value of the ruling amounts at the beginning of the acceleration period is equal to the amount by which the aggregate present value of the ruling amounts that would have been approved but for this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) exceeds the acceleration amount;

(C) The acceleration period is the period from the first day of the transferor's first taxable year beginning after the date of the transfer until the end of the plant's remaining useful life;

(D) Present values will be determined using the assumptions that are used in determining the transferee's first schedule of ruling amounts; and

(E) A transferor and a transferee are related if their relationship is specified in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) or they are treated as a single taxpayer under section 41(f)(1)(A) or (B).
