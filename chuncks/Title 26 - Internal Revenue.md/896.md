()The Agency must select the low-income units to inspect and low-income certifications to review in a manner that does not give advance notice that a particular low-income unit (or low-income certifications for a particular low-income unit) will or will not be inspected (or reviewed) for a particular year. The Agency may notify the owner of the low-income units for on-site inspection only on the day of inspection. However, the Agency may give an owner reasonable notice that an inspection of the project and of not-yet-identified low-income units or review of low-income certifications will occur. The notice serves to enable the owner to assemble needed documentation for low-income certifications for review and to notify tenants of the possibility of physical inspection of their units.
