###### ยง 1.279-3 Corporate acquisition indebtedness.
####### Convertible obligation.

(d)An obligation which is issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in section 279 (b)(1) is convertible within the meaning of section 279(b)(3) if it is either-(1) Convertible directly or indirectly into stock of the issuing corporation, or (2) Part of an investment unit or other arrangement which includes, in addition to such bond or other evidence of indebtedness, an option to acquire directly or indirectly stock in the issuing corporation. Stock warrants or convertible preferred stock included as part of an investment unit constitute options within the meaning of the preceding sentence. Indebtedness is indirectly convertible if the conversion feature gives the holder the right to convert into another bond of the issuing corporation which is then convertible into the stock of the issuing corporation. In any case where the corporation which in fact issues an obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) is a member of an affiliated group, the provisions of section 279(b)(3) and this paragraph are deemed satisfied if the stock into which either the obligation or option which is part of an investment unit or other arrangement is convertible, directly or indirectly, is stock of any member of the affiliated group.
