####### Yield for purposes of applying paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(3)For purposes of applying paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the yield of the section 467 loan balance of any party, or prior party, to a section 467 rental agreement for a period is the same for all parties and is the yield that results in the net accrual of positive or negative interest for that period equal to the amount of such interest that accrues under the terms of the rental agreement for that period. For example, if property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is sold (transferred) and the beginning section 467 loan balance of the transferor (as described in ยง 1.467-7(e)(2)(i)) is positive and the beginning section 467 loan balance of the transferee (as described in ยง 1.467-7(e)(2)(ii)) is negative, the yield on each of these loan balances for any period is the same for all parties and is the yield that results in the net accrual of positive or negative interest, taking into account the aggregate positive or negative interest on the section 467 loan balances of both the transferor and transferee, equal to the amount of such interest that accrues under the terms of the rental agreement for that period.
