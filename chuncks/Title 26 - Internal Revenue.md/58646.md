####### Coordination with State requirements,Contracts issued in a State that imposes more stringent requirements.

(b)-(1)If a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C, then, under section 4980C(f), compliance with the more stringent requirement of State law is considered compliance with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C. The principles of paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply to any case in which a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C (as described in this paragraph (b)(1)), but in which there has been a failure to comply with that State requirement.
