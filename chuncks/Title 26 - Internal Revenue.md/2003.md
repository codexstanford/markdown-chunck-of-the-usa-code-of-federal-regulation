If a TRASOP security is not allocated to a participant's account for a plan year because of section 415 and section 301(d)(3) of the 1975 TRA, no other amount may be allocated for that participant under any defined contribution plan of the same employer after the actual allocation date for that TRASOP plan year, until all unallocated TRASOP securities have been allocated as provided in paragraphs (d)(6) (vi) and (vii) of this section. This subdivision (v) applies to a TRASOP when, under section 415(f)(1)(B), the TRASOP is treated along with an employer's other defined contribution plans as one plan for purposes of section 415.
