Thus, amounts deposited for the taxable year with respect to amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and ยง 3.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels) shall be treated as a deduction in arriving at the party's taxable income from sources without the United States (subject to the apportionment rules and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) and the party's entire taxable income for the taxable year.
