####### Account or instrument automatically acquired on the maturity or termination of an account.

(ii)When an account is opened, or an instrument is acquired, automatically on the maturity or termination of an account that was in existence or an instrument that was held before January 1, 1984 (or considered to have been in existence or held before that date by operation of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)), without the participation of the payee, the new account or instrument, in the discretion of the payor, may be considered a pre-1984 account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payee is not considered to have participated in the acquisition of the new account or instrument solely because the payee failed to exercise a right to withdraw funds at the maturity or termination of the old account or instrument.
