###### ยง 1.1371-2 Impact of Audit PTTP on ETSC Period.
####### Effect on corporation.

(B)Pursuant to ยง 1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii), X's AAA is reduced by $49,000 to $0. Following the initial PTTP, even if X satisfies the requirements of section 481(d)(2) of the Code and ยง 1.481-5(b) to be an ETSC, X does not have an ETSC period because its AAA balance is zero at the end of its initial PTTP. Therefore, section 1371(f) of the Code and ยง 1.1371-1 will not apply to any subsequent distributions by X.
