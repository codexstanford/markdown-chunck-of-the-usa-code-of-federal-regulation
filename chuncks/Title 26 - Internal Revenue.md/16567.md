####### Effect of section 338 election on section 846(e) election,In general.

(e)-(1)New target and old target are treated as the same corporation for purposes of an election by old target to use its historical loss payment pattern under section 846(e). See ยง 1.338-1(b)(2)(vii). Therefore, if old target has a section 846(e) election in effect on the acquisition date, new target will continue to use the historical loss payment pattern of old target to discount unpaid losses incurred in accident years covered by the election, unless new target elects to revoke the section 846(e) election. In addition, new target may consider old target's historical loss payment pattern when determining whether to make the section 846(e) election for a determination year that includes or is subsequent to the acquisition date.
