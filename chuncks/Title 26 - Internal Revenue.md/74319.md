####### Domicile defined.

(3)For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the term "domicile" shall mean an individual's fixed or permanent home. An individual acquires a domicile in a place by living there; even for a brief period of time, with no definite present intention of later removing therefrom. Residence without the requisite intention to remain indefinitely will not suffice to change domicile, nor will intention to change domicile effect such a change until accompanied by actual removal. A domicile, once acquired, is maintained until a new domicile is acquired.
