######## Entities filing a partnership return.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C) and the regulations thereunder shall apply with respect to any taxable year of an entity for which such entity files a partnership return as well as to such entity's items for that taxable year and to any person holding an interest in such entity at any time during that taxable year. Any final partnership administrative adjustment or judicial determination resulting from a proceeding under subchapter C with respect to such taxable year may include a determination that the entity is not a partnership for such taxable year as well as determinations with respect to all items of the entity that would be partnership items, as defined in section 6231(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder, if such entity had been a partnership in such taxable year (including, for example, any amounts taxable to an entity determined to be an association taxable as a corporation). For example, a final determination under subchapter C that an entity that filed a partnership return is an association taxable as a corporation will serve as a basis for a computational adjustment reflecting the disallowance of any loss or credit claimed by a purported partner with respect to that entity.
