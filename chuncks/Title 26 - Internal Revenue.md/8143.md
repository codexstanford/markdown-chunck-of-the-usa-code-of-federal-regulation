###### ยง 1.163(j)-5 General rules governing disallowed business interest expense carryforwards for C corporations.
####### Example 1: Determination of SRLY limitation,Facts.

(i)-(A)Individual A owns P. In 2021, A forms T, which pays or accrues a $100x business interest expense for which a deduction is disallowed under section 163(j) and that is carried forward to 2022. P does not pay or accrue business interest expense in 2021, and P has no disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from prior taxable years. At the close of 2021, P acquires all of the stock of T, which joins with P in filing a consolidated return beginning in 2022. Neither P nor T pays or accrues business interest expense in 2022, and the P group has a section 163(j) limitation of $300x in that year. This limitation would be $70x if determined by reference solely to T's items for all consolidated return years of the P group.
