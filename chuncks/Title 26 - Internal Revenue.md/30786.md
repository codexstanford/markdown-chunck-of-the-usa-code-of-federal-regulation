Under § 1.652(b)-3(a), the $2,000 of rental real estate expenses is allocated to the $2,000 of rental income. In the exercise of the executor's discretion pursuant to § 1.652(b)-3(b), D's executor allocates $3,500 of personal property taxes and $1,000 of section 67(e) deductions to the remaining income. As a result, the excess deductions on termination of the estate are $11,000, all consisting of section 67(e) deductions.
