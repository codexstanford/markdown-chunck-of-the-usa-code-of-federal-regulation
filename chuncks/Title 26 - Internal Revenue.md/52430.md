####### S sells the stock of Q after 10 years.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, except that in 2029, instead of P selling all of the stock of S, S sells all of the stock of Q to X for its fair market value of $800x. At the time of the sale, S has owned the Q stock for over 10 years, and S elects under section 1400Z-2(c) to adjust its stock basis in Q from $500x (see the analysis in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) to $800x, the fair market value of Q on the date of the sale. As a result of the election, S has no gain on the sale of Q stock. Additionally, the $300x basis increase in Q is treated as tax-exempt income to S pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, P increases its basis in P's S stock by $300x under ยง 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii).
