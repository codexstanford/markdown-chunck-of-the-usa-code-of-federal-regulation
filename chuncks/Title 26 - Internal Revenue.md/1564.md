Increasing the amount of carbon dioxide captured without physically modifying existing carbon capture equipment or adding new equipment, for example, by merely operating the existing carbon capture equipment above the carbon dioxide capture capacity, does not constitute the installation of additional carbon capture equipment. For purposes of this section, the termmeans capture design capacity.
