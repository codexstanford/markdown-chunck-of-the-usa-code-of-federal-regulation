###### ยง 1.337(d)-6 New transitional rules imposing tax on property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT.
####### Property subject to the rules of section 1374 owned by a RIC, REIT, or S corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT.

(ii)If property subject to the rules of section 1374 owned by a RIC, a REIT, or an S corporation (the predecessor) becomes the property of a RIC or REIT (the successor) in a continuation transaction, the rules of section 1374 apply to the successor to the same extent that the predecessor was subject to the rules of section 1374 with respect to such property, and the 10-year recognition period of the successor with respect to such property is reduced by the portion of the 10-year recognition period of the predecessor that expired before the date of the continuation transaction. For this purpose, a continuation transaction means the qualification of the predecessor as a RIC or REIT or the transfer of property from the predecessor to the successor in a transaction in which the successor's basis in the transferred property is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the predecessor's basis in that property.
