####### Rules for determining whether a termination of employment has occurred.

(ii)For purposes of this section, the taxpayer is deemed to have terminated the employment of any WIN employee (as defined in paragraph (h) of ยง 1.50B-1) if the employment relationship (as determined under common law principles) has terminated. A layoff for any reason is considered a termination of employment for purposes of the preceding sentence. However, a temporary suspension of employment of any WIN employee necessitated by the installation of new equipment or by the retooling of existing equipment (such as for a model changeover in the automobile industry) shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment if such suspension is for a period of time no longer than 60 days. For purposes of this section, the death of the taxpayer is considered a termination of the employment relationship between the taxpayer and any WIN employee.
