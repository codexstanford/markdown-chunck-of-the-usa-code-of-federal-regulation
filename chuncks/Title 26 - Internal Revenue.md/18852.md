####### Introduction.

(a)This section provides rules to adjust the value of a loss corporation that is a member of a controlled group of corporations on a change date so that the same value is not included more than once in computing the limitations under section 382 for the loss corporations that are members of the controlled group. In general, the adjustment is made under paragraph (c) of this section by reducing the value of the loss corporation by the value of the stock of each component member of the controlled group that the loss corporation owns immediately after the ownership change. The loss corporation's value may, however, be increased under paragraph (c) of this section by any amount of value that the other member elects to restore to the loss corporation.
