####### v,Effective foreign tax rate.

()The effective foreign tax rate is determined under paragraph (c)(7)(vi) of this section by dividing the U.S. dollar amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to each respective tentative tested income item by the U.S. dollar amount of the tentative tested income item increased by the U.S. dollar amount of the relevant foreign income taxes. Therefore, the effective foreign tax rate with respect to the FDE1Y tentative tested income item is 25%, computed by dividing $20x (the U.S. dollar amount of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to the FDE1Y tentative tested income item under paragraph (c)(7)(vii) of this section) by $80x (the sum of $60x, the U.S. dollar amount of the FDE1Y tentative tested income item, and $20x, the U.S. dollar amount of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to the FDE1Y tentative tested income item). The CFC1X tentative tested income item is not subject to any foreign income tax, so is subject to an effective foreign tax rate of 0%, calculated as $0 (the U.S. dollar amount of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to the CFC1X tentative tested income item) divided by $20x (the U.S. dollar amount of the CFC1X tentative tested income item).
