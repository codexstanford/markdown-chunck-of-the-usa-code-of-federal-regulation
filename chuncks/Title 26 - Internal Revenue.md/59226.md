(11)The termmay be construed to mean, to the extent that it is impossible to determine the actual amount of such depreciation from the books and records, that amount which is obtained by (i) deducting the "cost of reproduction new less depreciation" from the "cost of reproduction new", as ascertained as of the valuation date by the Interstate Commerce Commission under the provisions of section 19a of part I of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 19a), and then (ii) making such retroactive adjustments to the remainder as are required, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to properly reflect the depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913. For this purpose, any retirement-straight line property held on March 1, 1913, and retired on or before the valuation date shall be taken into account.
