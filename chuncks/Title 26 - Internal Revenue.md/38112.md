###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Example 9.

(ix)USP, a domestic corporation, earns $100x of passive royalty income from sources within the United States. Under the laws of Country X, however, that royalty is considered to be from sources within Country X, and Country X imposes a 5% withholding tax on the payment of the royalty. USP also earns $100x of foreign source passive dividend income from Country Y subject to a 10% withholding tax to which $15x of expenses are allocated. In determining whether USP's passive income is high-taxed, the $5x withholding tax on USP's royalty income is allocated to passive income, and to the group of passive income described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (passive income subject to a withholding tax of less than 15% (but greater than zero)). For purposes of determining whether the income is high-taxed, however, only the $85x of foreign source dividend income (and not the $100x of U.S. source royalty income) is taken into account. The foreign source dividend income is treated as passive category income because the foreign taxes paid on the passive income in the group ($15x) do not exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $85x of net foreign source income in the group ($15x < $17.85x ($100x - $15x) x 21%).
