####### Example 3: Sale of partnership interest,1,Facts.

(C)-()USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3, each a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 and CFC2 are equal partners in PRS, a partnership. PRS owns Asset B with an adjusted basis of $20x and a fair market value of $100x. PRS has a section 754 election in effect. USP, CFC2, and CFC3 all use the calendar year as their taxable year. CFC1 uses a taxable year ending November 30. On November 1, 2018, before the start of its first CFC inclusion year, CFC1 sells its interest in the partnership to CFC3 for $50x of cash. CFC1 has an adjusted basis of $10x in its partnership interest, and thus CFC1 recognizes $40x of gain as a result of the sale ($50x - $10x), none of which is foreign base company income or otherwise subject to U.S. tax. As a result of the sale, there is a $40x adjustment to the adjusted basis in Asset B with respect to CFC3 under section 743(b).
