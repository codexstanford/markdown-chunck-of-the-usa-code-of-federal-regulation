######## Example 3.

(C)On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported $200 of non-cash charitable contributions related to its contribution of merchandise. Partnership has two equal partners for the 2020 tax year: C and D, both individuals. Partnership correctly reports $100 in non-cash charitable contributions to both C and D for the 2020 taxable year. On her return for the 2020 taxable year, C erroneously deducts the entire $100 of non-cash charitable contributions, even though C's deduction for charitable contributions would be limited by section 170(b)(1)(A) to $50 because of C's income. The $100 of non-cash charitable contribution reported by Partnership to C is a partnership-related item. However, the amount of the deduction taken by C on her return for 2020 and the amount of that deduction allowed after application of the limitation contained in section 170(b)(1)(A) to the $100 in non-cash charitable contributions reported by Partnership to C is not a partnership-related item under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section because it is not with respect to the partnership.
