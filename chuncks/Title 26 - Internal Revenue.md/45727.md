###### ยง 1.1250-1 Gain from dispositions of certain depreciable realty.
####### Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1250.

(4)Section 1250 does not prevent gain which is not recognized under section 1250 from being considered as gain under another provision of the Code, such as, for example, section 1239 (relating to gain from sale of depreciable property between certain related persons). Thus, for example, if section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $10,000 is sold for $17,500 in a transaction to which section 1239 applies, and if $5,000 of the gain would be recognized under section 1250(a) then the remaining $2,500 of the gain would be treated as ordinary income under section 1239.
