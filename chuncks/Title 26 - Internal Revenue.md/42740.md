###### § 1.987-12 Deferral of section 987 gain or loss.
####### Deemed remittance when a successor QBU ceases to be owned by a member of the deferral QBU owner's controlled group.

(iii)For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), in a taxable year of the deferral QBU owner in which a successor QBU ceases to be owned by a member of a controlled group that includes the deferral QBU owner, the successor QBU owner is treated as having a remittance proportion of 1. Accordingly, if there is only one successor QBU with respect to a deferral QBU and that successor QBU ceases to be owned by a member of the controlled group that includes the deferral QBU owner, all outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss with respect to that deferral QBU will be recognized. This paragraph (c)(2)(iii) does not affect the application of §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-11 to the successor QBU owner with respect to its ownership of the successor QBU.
