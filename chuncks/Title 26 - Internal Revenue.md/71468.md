##### ยง 57.7 Notification and fee payment.
###### Differences in preliminary fee calculation and final calculation.

(c)A covered entity's final fee calculation may differ from the covered entity's preliminary fee calculation because of changes made pursuant to the error correction process described in ยง 57.6 or because the IRS discovered additional information relevant to the fee calculation through other information sources as described in ยง 57.4(b)(1). Even if a covered entity did not file a corrected Form 8963 described in ยง 57.6, a covered entity's final fee may differ from a covered entity's preliminary fee because of information discovered about that covered entity through other information sources. In addition, a change in aggregate net premiums written for health insurance of United States health risks can affect every covered entity's fee because each covered entity's fee is equal to a fraction of the aggregate fee collected from all covered entities.
