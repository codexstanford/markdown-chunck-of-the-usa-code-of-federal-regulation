See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for additional rules relating to the employer excise tax on amounts distributed more than 2months (6 months in the case of certain plans that include an eligible automatic contribution arrangement within the meaning of section 414(w)) after the end of the plan year. See also ยง 1.402(c)-2, A-4, prohibiting rollover of distributions that are excess aggregate contributions.
