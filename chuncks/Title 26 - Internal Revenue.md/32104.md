()If one or more assets owned by a partnership are relevant foreign assets (or RFAs) with respect to a foreign income tax, then, solely for purposes of applying the safe harbor provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(viii)()() of this section to allocations of CFTEs with respect to that foreign income tax, the net income in a CFTE category that includes partnership items of income, deduction, gain, or loss attributable to the RFA shall be increased by the amount described in paragraph (b)(4)(viii)()()() of this section and reduced by the amount described in paragraph (b)(4)(viii)()()() of this section. Similarly, a partner's CFTE category share of income shall be increased by the portion of the amount described in paragraph (b)(4)(viii)()()() of this section that is allocated to the partner under § 1.901(m)-5(d) and reduced by the portion of the amount described in paragraph (b)(4)(viii)()()() of this section that is allocated to the partner under § 1.901(m)-5(d).
