####### Special rule for downstream partnership loans,In general.

(8)-(i)For purposes of apportioning interest expense that is not directly allocable under paragraph (e)(4) of this section or ยง 1.861-10T, the disregarded portion of a downstream partnership loan is not considered an asset of a downstream partnership loan lender (DPL lender). The disregarded portion of a downstream partnership loan is the portion of the value of the loan (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section) that bears the same proportion to the total value of the loan as the matching income amount that is included by the DPL lender for a taxable year with respect to the loan bears to the total amount of downstream partnership loan interest income (DPL interest income) that is included directly or indirectly in gross income by the DPL lender with respect to the loan during that taxable year.
