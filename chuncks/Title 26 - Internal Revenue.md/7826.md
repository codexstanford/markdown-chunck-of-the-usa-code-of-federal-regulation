####### ii,Adjustments in 2025.,1,2,3,2,i,2

()Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(C)() of this section, P's stock in T is treated as a successor asset for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) and (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section. Moreover, P's sale of its T stock causes both T and S to deconsolidate. Thus, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A)() of this section, the transaction is treated as a taxable disposition of all of the T stock and all of the S stock held by all members of the P group. Under the anti-duplication rule in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(D) of this section, the total amount of gain recognized for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)()() of this section is $40x, the greater of the gain on the disposition of the T stock ($40x) or on the disposition of the S stock ($25x). However, the negative adjustments under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section are subject to the negative adjustment cap in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(F) of this section. Thus, the P group must subtract $20x from its tentative taxable income in computing its ATI for its 2025 taxable year.
