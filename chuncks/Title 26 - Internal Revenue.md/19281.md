###### § 1.385-4 Treatment of consolidated groups.
####### Treatment of consolidated groups,Members treated as one corporation.

(b)-(1)For purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, and except as otherwise provided in this section and § 1.385-3, all members of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)) that file (or that are required to file) a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return are treated as one corporation. Thus, for example, when a member of a consolidated group issues a covered debt instrument that is not a consolidated group debt instrument, the consolidated group generally is treated as the issuer of the covered debt instrument for purposes of this section and § 1.385-3. Also, for example, when one member of a consolidated group issues a covered debt instrument that is not a consolidated group debt instrument and therefore is treated as issued by the consolidated group, and another member of the consolidated group makes a distribution or acquisition described in § 1.385-3(b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) with an expanded group member that is not a member of the consolidated group, § 1.385-3(b)(3)(i) may treat the covered debt instrument as funding the distribution or acquisition made by the consolidated group. In addition, except as otherwise provided in this section, acquisitions and distributions described in § 1.385-3(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) in which all parties to the transaction are members of the same consolidated group both before and after the transaction are disregarded for purposes of this section and § 1.385-3.
