() The P group's ability to deduct net operating losses in Year 2 is subject to the 80-percent limitation, based on the P group's consolidated taxable income for the year. Thus, the group's limitation for Year 2 is $72 ($90 x 80 percent). However, use of the Year 1 net operating loss also is subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T applicable to SRLY net operating losses for Year 2 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $60. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 2 is $48 ($60 x 80 percent). Therefore, only $48 of T's Year 1 SRLY net operating loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 2. T carries over its remaining $52 of its Year 1 loss to Year 3.
