####### Exception for insubstantially improved land.

(C)Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, if the land is unimproved or minimally improved and the eligible entity purchases the land with an expectation or an intention to not improve the land by more than an insubstantial amount within 30 months after the date of purchase, paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(B) of this section does not apply with respect to such land and such land is not considered qualified opportunity zone business property unless it is substantially improved within the meaning of sections 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II) and (d)(2)(D)(ii). In determining whether an eligible entity had an expectation or an intention to improve the land by more than an insubstantial amount, improvements to the land by the eligible entity (including grading, clearing of the land, remediation of the contaminated land, or acquisition of related qualified opportunity zone business property that facilitates the use of the land in a trade or business of the eligible entity) will be taken into account.
