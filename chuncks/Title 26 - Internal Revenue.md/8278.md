#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### § 1.163(j)-6 Application of the section 163(j) limitation to partnerships and subchapter S corporations.
####### Partner-level allocations.

(iii)Because PRS is not subject to section 163(j) by reason of section 163(j)(3), PRS's $45 of business interest expense does not retain its character as business interest expense for purposes of section 163(j). As a result, such business interest expense is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the level of either the partnership or partner. Additionally, pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(m)(1), each partner includes its share of non-excepted trade or business items of income, gain, loss, and deduction (including business interest expense and business interest income) of PRS when calculating its ATI. As a result, each partner increases its ATI by $45 (one third of $150 + $30-$45). Also, X increases its ATI by an additional $25 because its items of investment income and loss from PRS are recharacterized as non-excepted trade or business income and loss at its level pursuant to §§ 1.163(j)-4(b)(3)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(b)(6). Further, X increases its business interest expense by its $20 allocation of investment interest expense from PRS pursuant to §§ 1.163(j)-4(b)(3)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(b)(6).
