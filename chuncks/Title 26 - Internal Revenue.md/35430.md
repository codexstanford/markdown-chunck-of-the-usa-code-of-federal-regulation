####### Example 3. Anti-abuse rule,Facts.,Example 1

(iii)-(A)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in). A sells its U.S. assets to B, an unrelated U.S. corporation, with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability by manipulating the property fraction. A then leases these assets from B. After this transaction, under the general rule of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all of A's gross income would be considered from sources without the United States, because all of A's relevant production assets are located within a foreign country. Since the leased property is not owned by the taxpayer, it is not included in the fraction.
