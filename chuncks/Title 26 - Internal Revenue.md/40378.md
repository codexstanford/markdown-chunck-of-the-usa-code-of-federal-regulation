####### Analysis.

(B)In Year 1, USP has net CFC tested income (as defined in ยง 1.951A-1(c)(2)) of $350x ($100x + $300x-$50x) and, because USP has no net deemed tangible income return, a GILTI inclusion amount (as defined in ยง 1.951A-1(c)(1)) of $350x ($350x-$0). The aggregate amount of USP's pro rata share of tested income is $400x ($100x from CFC1 + $300x from CFC2). Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of USP's GILTI inclusion amount treated as being with respect to CFC1 is $87.50x ($350x x $100x/$400x). The portion of USP's GILTI inclusion amount treated as being with respect to CFC2 is $262.50x ($350x x $300x/$400x). The portion of USP's GILTI inclusion amount treated as being with respect to CFC3 is $0 because CFC3 is a tested loss CFC.
