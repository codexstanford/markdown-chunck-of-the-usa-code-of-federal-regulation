###### ยง 1.826-2 Special rules applicable to electing reciprocals.
####### Denial of surtax exemption.

(b)Section 826(f) provides that the tax imposed upon any increase in the mutual insurance company taxable income of a reciprocal which is attributable to the limitation provided by section 826(b) shall be computed without regard to the surtax exemption provided by section 821(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder. Thus, a company making the election provided under section 826(a) will be subject to surtax, as well as normal tax, on the increase in its mutual insurance company taxable income for the taxable year which is attributable to such election. Similarly, any amount which was added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election under section 826(a) and ยง 1.826-1, and which is subtracted from such account in accordance with section 826(d) and paragraph (a) of this section, will be subject to surtax, as well as normal tax, to the extent such amount increases mutual insurance company taxable income in the year in which the subtraction is made. Furthermore, the company will be subject to surtax on such increases notwithstanding the fact that it may have no normal tax liability for the taxable year, because its mutual insurance company taxable income (after giving effect to the election provided by section 826(a)) does not exceed $6,000.
