####### 3,Meaning of reasonable notice.,2

()For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)() of this section, reasonable notice is generally no more than 15 days. The notice period begins on the date the Agency informs the owner that an on-site inspection of a project and low-income units or low-income certification review will occur. Notice of more than 15 days, however, may be reasonable in extraordinary circumstances that are beyond an Agency's control and that prevent an Agency from carrying out within 15 days an on-site inspection or low-income certification review. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. In the event of extraordinary circumstances that result in a reasonable-notice period longer than 15 days, an Agency must select the relevant units and conduct the same-day on-site inspection or low-income certification review as soon as practicable.
