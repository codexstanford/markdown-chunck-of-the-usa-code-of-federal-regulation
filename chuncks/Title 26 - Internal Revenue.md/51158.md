####### Identification and documentation procedure for preexisting individual accounts,In general.,1,2

(5)-(i)With respect to a preexisting individual account, unless the account is an account described in § 1.1471-5(a)(4)(i) (providing exception to U.S. account status for certain depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less), a participating FFI may follow the identification and documentation procedures described below in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) through (iv) of this section (as applicable), in lieu of the identification and documentation procedures described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, to determine if an account that is a preexisting account is a U.S. account, non-U.S. account, or account held by a recalcitrant account holder. A participating FFI must first determine whether there are any U.S. indicia associated with the account (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)() of this section), and second, if there are U.S. indicia associated with the account, retain a record of the documentation described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)() of this section to establish the account holder's chapter 4 status. For this purpose, the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) do not apply. A participating FFI must complete the requisite identification and documentation procedures with respect to each account within the time period provided by § 1.1471-5(g)(3)(i) or (ii) (as applicable) or, if unable to do so, must treat such account as held by a recalcitrant account holder. A participating FFI may continue to treat an account with no U.S. indicia or an account that meets a documentation exception described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section or § 1.1471-5(a)(4)(i) (providing exception to U.S. account status for certain depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less) as a non-U.S. account, until there is a change in circumstances with respect to the account as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
