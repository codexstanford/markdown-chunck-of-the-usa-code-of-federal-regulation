###### ยง 1.986(a)-1 Translation of foreign income taxes for purposes of the foreign tax credit.
####### Refunds or other reductions of foreign income tax liability.

(c)In the case of a section 901 taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when accrued, a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign income taxes that is attributable to a refund of foreign income taxes, a credit allowed in lieu of a refund, or a reduction in or other downward adjustment to an accrued amount, including an adjustment on account of accrued foreign income taxes that were not paid by the date 24 months after the close of the U.S. taxable year to which such taxes relate, is translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes (as defined in ยง 1.960-3(d)(1)). In the case of foreign income taxes taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date of payment, see ยง 1.905-3(b) for required adjustments to reflect a foreign tax redetermination (as defined in ยง 1.905-3(a)) attributable to a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign income taxes that is attributable to a difference in exchange rates between the date or taxable year of accrual and the date of payment. In the case of a section 901 taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when paid, a refund or other reduction in or downward adjustment to the amount of foreign income taxes is translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when claimed as a credit. If a refund or other reduction of foreign income taxes relates to foreign income taxes paid or accrued on more than one date, then the refund or other reduction is deemed to be derived from, and reduces, the payments of foreign income taxes in order, starting with the most recent payment of foreign income taxes first, to the extent thereof.
