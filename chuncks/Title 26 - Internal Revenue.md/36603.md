###### § 1.883-4 Qualified shareholder stock ownership test.
####### Special rule for closely-held corporations traded in the United States.

(viii)To demonstrate that a class of stock is not closely-held for purposes of § 1.883-2(d)(3)(i), a foreign corporation whose stock is traded on an established securities market in the United States may rely on current Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to identify its 5-percent shareholders in each class of stock relied upon to meet the regularly traded test, without having to make any independent investigation to determine the identity of the 5-percent shareholder. However, if any class of stock is determined to be closely-held within the meaning of § 1.883-2(d)(3)(i), the publicly traded corporation cannot satisfy the requirements of § 1.883-2(e) unless it obtains sufficient documentation described in this paragraph (d) to demonstrate that the requirements of § 1.883-2(d)(3)(ii) are met with respect to the 5-percent shareholders.
