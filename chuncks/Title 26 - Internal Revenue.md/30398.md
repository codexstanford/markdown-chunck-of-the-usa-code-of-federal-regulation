###### ยง 1.614-4 Treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 with respect to separate operating mineral interests for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, in the case of oil and gas wells.

However, if, at the time of the filing of the statement revoking the election under section 614(b), assessment of any deficiency or credit or refund of any overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from such revocation is prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law for any taxable year or years for which the election under section 614(b) was made, then the adjusted basis of each separate property that is a part of the aggregation shall be determined in accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph (a)(2) of ยง 1.614.6 as of the first day of the first taxable year for which the revocation is effective.

See, however, paragraph (b) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
