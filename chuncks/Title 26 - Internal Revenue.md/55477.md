####### No effect on other filing requirements.

(d)An organization that is relieved from filing an information return under section 6033(a) is still subject to the requirements of §§ 1.6033-2(i) and (j), concerning: notice regarding changes in character, operations, or purpose; provision of additional information; duty to file other returns of information; and duty to file unrelated business tax returns. If an organization is required to file an unrelated business tax return, Form 990-T, "Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return," the filing of that return does not relieve the organization from the requirement of submitting an annual electronic notification under section 6033(i).
