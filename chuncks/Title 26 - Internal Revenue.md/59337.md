####### In general.

(a)The deduction provided by § 1.9200-1 shall be taken by multiplying the amount of the monthly deduction determined under § 1.9200-1 (c)(2) for each motor carrier operating authority by the number of months in the taxable year for which the deduction is allowable, and entering the resulting amount at the appropriate place on the taxpayer's return for each year in which the deduction is properly claimed. Additionally, any taxpayer who has claimed the deduction provided by § 1.9200-1 must (unless it has already filed a statement containing the required information) attach a statement to the next income tax return of the taxpayer which has a filing due date on or after June 4, 1984. The statement shall provide, in addition to the taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number, the following information for each motor carrier operating authority for which a deduction was claimed:

(1) The taxable year of the taxpayer for which the deduction was first claimed;

(2) Whether the taxpayer's deduction was determined using the adjusted basis of the authority under section 1012 or an allocated stock basis under § 1.9200-1(e)(2); and

(3) If an allocation of stock basis has been made under § 1.9200-1(e)(2), the calculations made in determining the amount of basis to be allocated to the authority.
