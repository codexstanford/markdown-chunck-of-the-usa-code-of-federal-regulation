####### Example 2 (Election to prepay tax on excess parachute payments and effect on excess remuneration),Facts.

(ii)-(A)Employee B is a covered employee of ATEO 2 with a base amount of $200,000 who is entitled to receive two parachute payments from ATEO 2, one of $200,000 and the other of $900,000. The $200,000 payment is made upon separation from employment, and the $900,000 payment is to be made on a date in a future taxable year. The present value of the $900,000 payment is $800,000 as of the date of the separation from employment. ATEO 2 elects to prepay the excise tax on the $900,000 future parachute payment (of which $740,000 is an excess parachute payment). The tax rate under section 11 is 21 percent for the taxable year the excise tax is paid and, using a discount rate determined under ยง 53.4960-3(i), the present value of the $155,400 ($740,000 x 21 percent) excise tax on the $740,000 future excess parachute payment is $140,000.
