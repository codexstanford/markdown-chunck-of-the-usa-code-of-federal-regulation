()Under paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(A) of this section, CFC1X's tentative tested income items are computed by treating the CFC1X tentative gross tested income item and the FDE1Y tentative gross tested income item each as income in a separate tested income group (the "CFC1X income group" and the "FDE1Y income group") and by allocating and apportioning CFC1X's deductions for current year taxes under § 1.861-20 (CFC1X has no other deductions to allocate and apportion). Under paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(A) of this section and § 1.861-20(d)(3)(v), the €20x deduction for Country Y income taxes is allocated and apportioned solely to the FDE1Y income group (the "FDE1Y group tax") and none of the Country Y taxes are allocated and apportioned to the CFC1X income group.
