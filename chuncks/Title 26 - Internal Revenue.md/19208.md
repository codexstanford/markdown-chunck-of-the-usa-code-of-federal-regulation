(B)() Because USS1 and FP are both members of the FP expanded group, USS1 Note is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP in exchange for FP stock on Date A in Year 1 under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (d)(1)(i) of this section. This result applies even though, pursuant to the same plan, USS1 transfers the FP stock to persons that are not members of the FP expanded group. The exchange of USS1 Note for FP stock is not an exempt exchange within the meaning of paragraph (g)(11) of this section.
