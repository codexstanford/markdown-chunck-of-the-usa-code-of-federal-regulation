####### In general.

(a)An eligible taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment (or is deemed to make a cash payment) to a nuclear decommissioning fund or for a special transfer under § 1.468A-8 only if the taxpayer elects the application of section 468A. A separate election is required for each nuclear decommissioning fund and for each taxable year with respect to which payments are to be deducted under section 468A or a special transfer is made under § 1.468A-8. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated return for a taxable year, the common parent must make a separate election on behalf of each member whose payments to a nuclear decommissioning fund during such taxable year are to be deducted under section 468A and each member that makes a special transfer under § 1.468A-8 with respect to such year. The election under section 468A for any taxable year is irrevocable and must be made by attaching a statement (Election Statement) and a copy of the schedule of ruling amounts provided pursuant to the rules of § 1.468A-3 to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return (or, in the case of an affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated return, the consolidated return) for such taxable year. The return to which the Election Statement and a copy of the schedule of ruling amounts is attached must be filed on or before the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return for the taxable year with respect to which payments are to be deducted under section 468A.
