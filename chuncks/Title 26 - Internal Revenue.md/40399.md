####### Deficits in earnings and profits taken into account only once.

(ii)A controlled foreign corporation's deficit in earnings and profits for any taxable year preceding the taxable year shall be taken into account for the taxable year only to the extent such deficit has not been taken into account under this paragraph, paragraph (d) of this section, or paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of ยง 1.963-2 (applied as if section 963 had not been repealed by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) in computing a minimum distribution, for any taxable year preceding the taxable year, to reduce earnings and profits of such preceding year of such controlled foreign corporation or of any other controlled foreign corporation. To the extent a controlled foreign corporation's (the "first corporation") excess foreign base company shipping deductions for any taxable year (determined under ยง 1.955A-3(c)(2)(i)) reduce the foreign base company shipping income of another member of a related group (as defined in ยง 1.955A-2(b)), such deductions shall not be taken into account in determining the earnings and profits or deficits in earnings and profits of such first corporation for such taxable year for purposes of this paragraph (c) and paragraph (d) of this section. The rule of the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent the excess foreign base company shipping deductions of the first corporation reduce the foreign base company shipping income of another member of a related group below zero.
