###### ยง 53.4960-4 Liability for tax on excess remuneration and excess parachute payments.
####### Liability after a redetermination of total parachute payments.

(5)If an ATEO determines that an estimate made under ยง 53.4960-3(j)(1) was incorrect, it must reapply the 3-times-base-amount test to reflect the actual time and amount of the payment. In reapplying the 3-times-base-amount test (and, if necessary, reallocating the base amount), the ATEO must determine the correct base amount allocable to any parachute payment paid in the taxable year. See ยง 1.280G-1, Q/A-33(d) for examples that may be applied by analogy to illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(5).
