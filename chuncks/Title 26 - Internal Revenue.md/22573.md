####### Alternative method for determining employer-provided limit,1,General rule.

(B)-()If the plan limits elective deferrals for separate portions of the plan year, then, solely for purposes of determining the amount that is in excess of an employer-provided limit, the plan is permitted to provide that the applicable limit for the plan year is the product of the employee's plan year compensation and the time-weighted average of the deferral percentage limits, rather than determining the employer-provided limit as the sum of the limits for the separate portions of the year. Thus, for example, if, in accordance with the terms of the plan, highly compensated employees are limited to 8% of compensation during the first half of the plan year and 10% of compensation for the second half of the plan year, the plan is permitted to provide that the applicable limit for a highly compensated employee is 9% of the employee's plan year compensation.
