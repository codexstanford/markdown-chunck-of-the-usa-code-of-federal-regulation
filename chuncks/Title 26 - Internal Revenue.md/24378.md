###### § 1.446-4 Hedging transactions.
####### Notional principal contracts.

(5)The rules of § 1.446-3 govern the timing of income and deductions with respect to a notional principal contract unless, because the notional principal contract is part of a hedging transaction, the application of those rules would not result in the matching that is needed to satisfy the clear reflection requirement of paragraph (b) and, as applicable, (e)(4) of this section. For example, if a notional principal contract hedges a debt instrument, the method of accounting for periodic payments described in § 1.446-3(e) and the methods of accounting for nonperiodic payments described in § 1.446-3(f)(2)(iii) and (v) generally clearly reflect the taxpayer's income. The methods described in § 1.446-3(f)(2)(ii) and (iv), however, generally do not clearly reflect the taxpayer's income in that situation.
