####### ยง 301.6225-1 Partnership adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.
######## Example 2.,Example 1

(2)The facts are the same asin paragraph (h)(1) of this section, except that the -$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction would have been netted at the partnership level with the $5 adjustment to ordinary income and would have been required to be allocated to the partners of the partnership as a single partnership-related item for purposes of section 702(a), other provision of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS. Therefore, the $5 adjustment and the -$10 adjustment must be placed in the same subgrouping within the residual grouping. The $5 adjustment and the -$10 adjustments are then netted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Such netting results in a net negative adjustment (as defined under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section) of -$5. Pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the -$5 net negative adjustment is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment. Because the only net adjustment is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment, there is no imputed underpayment.
