####### Determination of when an amendment takes effect.

(iii)For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), the determination of whether an amendment that increases benefits takes effect and when it takes effect is determined in accordance with the rules of section 436(c) and ยง 1.436-1(c)(5). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), in the case of an amendment that decreases benefits, the amendment takes effect under a plan on the first date on which the benefits of any individual who is or could be a participant or beneficiary under the plan would be less than those benefits would be under the pre-amendment plan provisions if the individual were on that date to satisfy the applicable conditions for the benefits. In either case, the determination of when an amendment takes effect is unaffected by an election under section 412(d)(2).
