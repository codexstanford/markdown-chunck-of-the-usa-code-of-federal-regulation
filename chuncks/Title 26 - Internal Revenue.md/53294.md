###### § 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Other consolidation principles.

(l)The fact that this section treats the life and nonlife members as separate groups in computing, respectively, consolidated LICTI (or life consolidated net operating loss) and nonlife consolidated taxable income (or loss) does not affect the usual rules in §§ 1.1502-0 through 1.1502-100 unless this section provides otherwise. Thus, the usual rules in § 1.1502-13 (relating to intercompany transactions) apply to both the life and nonlife members by treating them as members of one affiliated group.
