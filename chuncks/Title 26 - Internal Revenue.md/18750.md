###### § 1.382-4 Constructive ownership of stock.
####### Indirect ownership interest.

(B)The indirect ownership interest that the holder of the option and any persons related to the holder have in the loss corporation is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of § 1.382-2T(h), other than § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A) (which treats stock attributed pursuant to section 318(a)(2) as no longer being owned by the entity from which it is attributed) and § 1.382-2T(h)(4) (which treats options as exercised in certain circumstances). If, however, the application of such constructive ownership rules without regard to § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A) would result in the same stock of the loss corporation being owned by two or more such persons, appropriate adjustments must be made so that such stock is not counted more than once in computing the aggregate ownership interests of such persons.
