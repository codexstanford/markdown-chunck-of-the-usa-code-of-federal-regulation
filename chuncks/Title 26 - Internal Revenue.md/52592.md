() Based on paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section and the analysis set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F)() of this section, at the end of Year 2, the P group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for Year 1 is the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to Year 1 ($16), or $41 ($16 + $25). Therefore, the P group can offset $16 of its Year 1 income with its CNOL carryback from Year 2.
