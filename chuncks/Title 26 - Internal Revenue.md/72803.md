######## Example 3.

(iii)C is a partner in Partnership during 2018. Partnership reports a loss of $100,000 on its partnership return for 2018. On the 2018 Schedule K-1 attached to the partnership return, Partnership reports $5,000 as C's distributive share of that loss. On the 2018 Schedule K-1 furnished to C, however, Partnership reports $15,000 as C's distributive share of the loss. C reports the $15,000 loss on C's 2018 income tax return. C has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because C reported C's distributive share of the loss in a manner that is inconsistent with how C's distributive share of the loss was reported on the 2018 partnership return actually filed. See, however, paragraph (d) of this section for the election to be treated as having reported the inconsistency where the partner treats an item consistently with an incorrect schedule.
