####### Same type and model of article.

(c)To qualify as the "same type and model of article", the article offered for sale must be an unused article essentially the same in size, design, and function as the article being leased. For example, a van-type truck trailer would not be the same type and model as a stake-body of flat-bed truck trailer. Neither would a 25-foot van-type trailer be the same type and model as a 35-foot van-type trailer. Slight differences in appearance or accessories will not render articles dissimilar which are identical in all other respects.
