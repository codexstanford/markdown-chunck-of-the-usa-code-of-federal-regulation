####### Section 965(a) inclusion amount.

(C)USP determines whether CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations, and, if so, determines its section 965(a) inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 and CFC2 are specified foreign corporations, and CFC1 and CFC2 each have accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income greater than zero as of an E&P measurement date. Accordingly, CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations. USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to each of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively, equals the section 965(a) earnings amount of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively.
