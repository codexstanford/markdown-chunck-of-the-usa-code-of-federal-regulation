()X, a C corporation, is engaged in the trade or business of generating electrical energy. During each determination period in the taxable year, 80 percent of the megawatt-hours generated in the electricity generation trade or business is sold at rates negotiated with the purchaser, and with respect to which X filed a schedule of rates with a public utility commission. The public utility commission has the authority to take action on the filed schedule of rates, but if no action is taken, the rules governing the public utility commission explicitly state that the public utility commission is deemed to have approved the rates. The public utility has taken no action with respect to the negotiated rate. The remaining 20 percent of the megawatt-hours is sold on the wholesale market at rates not established or subject to approval by a regulator described in ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(). X has not made an election under ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(iii). None of the assets used in X's utility generation trade or business are used in any other trade or business.
