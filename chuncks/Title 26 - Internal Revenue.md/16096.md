###### ยง 1.336-3 Aggregate deemed asset disposition price; various aspects of taxation of the deemed asset disposition.
####### Scope.

(a)This section provides rules under section 336(e) to determine the aggregate deemed asset disposition price (ADADP) for Target. ADADP is the amount for which old Target is deemed to have sold all of its assets in the deemed asset disposition. ADADP is allocated among Target's assets in the same manner as the aggregate deemed sale price (ADSP) is allocated under ยง 1.338-6 to determine the amount for which each asset is deemed to have been sold. If a subsequent increase or decrease is required under general principles of tax law with respect to an element of ADADP, the redetermined ADADP is allocated among Target's assets in the same manner as redetermined ADSP is allocated under ยง 1.338-7.
