####### Social security account numbers.

(c)(1) Every individual making a return of net earnings from self-employment for any period commencing before January 1, 1962, is required to show thereon his social security account number, or, if he has no such account number, to make application therefor on Form SS-5 before filing such return. However, the failure to apply for or receive a social security account number will not excuse the individual from the requirement that he file such return on or before the due date thereof. Form SS-5 may be obtained from any district office of the Social Security Administration or from any district director. The application shall be filed with a district office of the Social Security Administration or, in the case of an individual not in the United States, with the district office of the Social Security Administration at Baltimore, Md. An individual who has previously secured a social security account number as an employee shall use that account number on his return of net earnings from self-employment.

(2) For provisions applicable to the securing of identifying numbers and the reporting thereof on returns and schedules for periods commencing after December 31, 1961, see ยง 1.6109-1.
