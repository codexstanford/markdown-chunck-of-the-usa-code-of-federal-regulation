(B)Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A is $120x, which is the sum of $80x (DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A as illustrated in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(B)() of this section (the analysis in)) and $40x (DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset A). Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B is $80x, the sum of $100x (DC's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in the property as illustrated in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(B)() of this section (the analysis in)) and (-$20x) (DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset B). Therefore, under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, DC's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $200x ($120x + $80x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC increases its QBAI for Year 1 by $200x.
