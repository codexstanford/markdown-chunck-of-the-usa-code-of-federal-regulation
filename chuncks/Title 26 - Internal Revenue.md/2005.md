####### Suspense account.

(vii)If, after these allocations, TRASOP securities remain unallocated, they must be held in an unallocated suspense account under the TRASOP. Any income produced by these securities must also be held in the account. A plan with such an account will not fail to qualify under section 401(a) merely because of the account. In each successive TRASOP plan year (whether or not an applicable year), the unallocated assets are released from this account for allocation on a first-in-first-out basis. They are then allocated to the participants' accounts proportionately under paragraph (d)(6) (i) through (vi) of this section for each later year until no TRASOP securities remain unallocated. Value for this allocation is determined under paragraph (b)(7) of this section as of the date of transfer from the suspense account or, if the special 20-day average rule applies, the value is determined on the basis of the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of transfer from the suspense account.
