#### PART 400 - TEMPORARY REGULATIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL TAX LIEN ACT OF 1966
##### ยง 400.2-1 Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale; subordination of lien.
###### Subordination of lien,By payment of the amount of subordination.

(c)-(1)Pursuant to section 6325(d)(1), a district director may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of any lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien if there is paid over to the district director an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States. Under this provision, the tax lien may be subordinated to another lien or interest on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, if a notice of a Federal tax lien is filed and a delinquent taxpayer secures a mortgage on a part of the property subject to the tax lien and pays over the amount of the principal of the debt secured by the mortgage to a district director after an application for a certificate of subordination is approved, the district director will issue a certificate of subordination. This certificate will have the effect of subordinating the tax lien to the mortgage.
