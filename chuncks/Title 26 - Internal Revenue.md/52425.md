####### Distribution that creates an ELA.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section except that in 2024 Q2 distributes $70x to S. Under §§ 1.1502-13(f)(2) and 1.1502-32, the intercompany distribution from Q2 to S of $70x reduces S's basis in Q2 to $0 and creates an ELA of $20x ($50x-$70x). Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, because an ELA is created in Q2's stock, the distribution is an inclusion event to the extent of the increase in the ELA. S therefore includes $20x of its deferred gain into income in 2024. See § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(2). In addition, under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(g)(1)(ii), the adjustment to S's basis in Q2 under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) is applied before determining the other Federal income tax consequences of the distribution. Therefore, as a result of the inclusion event, S's basis in Q2 is first increased to $70x ($50x + $20x), and then S's basis in Q2 is reduced by $70x (the amount of the distribution) to $0 under § 1.1502-32.
