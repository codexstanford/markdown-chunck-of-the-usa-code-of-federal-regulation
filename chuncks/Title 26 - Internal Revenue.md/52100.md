####### Holding periods.

(ii)The holding period of property transferred in an intercompany transaction is the aggregate of the holding periods of S and B. However, if the basis of the property is determined by reference to the basis of other property, the property's holding period is determined by reference to the holding period of the other property. For example, if S distributes stock to B in a transaction to which section 355 applies, B's holding period in the distributed stock is determined by reference to B's holding period in the stock of S.
