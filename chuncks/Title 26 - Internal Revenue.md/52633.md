() The P group's ability to deduct net operating losses in Year 3 is subject to the 80-percent limitation, based on the P group's consolidated taxable income for the year. Thus, the P group's taxable income for Year 3 that can be offset, before use of net operating losses, is $40 (80 percent x the sum of zero capital gain, after use of the capital loss carryover, plus $50 of ordinary income). However, use of the Year 1 net operating loss also is subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T applicable to SRLY net operating losses for Year 3 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference only to T's items, or $40. This amount equals the sum obtained by adding the zero carryover from Year 2, a net inclusion of zero from capital items implicated in Year 3 ($30-$30), and $40 of taxable income in Year 3. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 3 is $32 ($40 x 80 percent). Therefore, only $32 of the Year 1 net operating loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 3. T carries over its remaining $20 of its Year 1 loss to Year 4.
