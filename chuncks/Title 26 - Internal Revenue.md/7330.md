# Title 26 - Internal Revenue
## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### § 1.162-33 Certain employee remuneration in excess of $1,000,000 not deductible for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
####### Conclusion.

(B)If this section applies, Employee A is a covered employee for Corporation X's 2018 through 2020 taxable years. Because the October 2, 2017, employment agreement is a written binding contract to pay Employee A $4,000,000 if Employee A is terminated without cause prior to December 31, 2020, this section does not apply (and § 1.162-27 does apply) to the deduction for $4,000,000 of Employee A's severance. Pursuant to § 1.162-27(c)(2), Employee A is not a covered employee for Corporation X's 2018 through 2020 taxable years. The deduction for $4,000,000 of Employee A's severance is not subject to section 162(m)(1). However, the employment agreement is treated as renewed on January 1, 2021, unless it is previously terminated, and this § 1.162-33 (and not § 1.162-27) will apply to the deduction for any payments made under the employment agreement, including for severance, on or after that date.
