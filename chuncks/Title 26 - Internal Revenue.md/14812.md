####### Analysis.

(ii)US1 is a specified party and thus a deduction for its $100x specified payment is subject to disallowance under section 267A. As described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, $35x of the payment is a disqualified hybrid amount under the disregarded payment rule of ยง 1.267A-2(b) and, as a result, $35x of the deduction is disallowed under ยง 1.267A-1(b)(1).
