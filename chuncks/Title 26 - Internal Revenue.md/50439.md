####### Certifications required.

(iii)For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a partnership must determine the amount realized on the transfer and any amount withheld by the transferee based on a certification from the transferee described in ยง 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2), without regard to whether the certification is received by the time prescribed in ยง 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2). A partnership that does not receive or cannot rely on a certification from the transferee described in ยง 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2) must withhold tax equal to the full amount of each distribution made with respect to a transferred interest until it receives a certification that it can rely on.
