####### Example 14. Complete disposition of transferred stock pursuant to a section 304(a)(1) transaction,Facts.

(xiv)-(A)UST wholly owns FA. In year 3, in a transaction to which section 304(a)(1) applies, TFC transfers all of the TFD stock to FA in exchange for cash. Under section 304(a)(1), TFC and FA are treated as if TFC transferred the TFD stock to FA in a section 351 exchange in exchange solely for FA stock, and then FA redeemed the FA stock deemed issued in exchange for the cash. Under section 302(d), the redemption of the FA stock deemed issued by FA to TFC under section 304(a)(1) is treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies.
