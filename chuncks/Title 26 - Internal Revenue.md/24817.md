(B)A is a calendar year taxpayer. For its AFS, A's financial results are reported on a June 30 fiscal year. Using the method described in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section, for the taxable year 2021, A computes AFS revenue for the 2021 tax year by taking the AFS revenue for the financial accounting year ending June 30, 2021 and multiplying it by a ratio equal to the number of days in the financial accounting year that are part of the 2021 tax year/365 and then adding to that amount the AFS revenue for the financial accounting year ending June 30, 2022 multiplied by the number of days in the financial accounting year that are part of the 2021 tax year/365.
