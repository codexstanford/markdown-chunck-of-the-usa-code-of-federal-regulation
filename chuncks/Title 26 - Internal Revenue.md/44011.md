####### Multiple discharged indebtednesses.

(2)If a taxpayer has COD income attributable to more than one discharged indebtedness resulting in the reduction of tax attributes under sections 108(b)(2) (A) through (D) and, if applicable, section 108(b)(5), paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be applied by allocating the tax-attribute reductions among the indebtednesses in proportion to the amount of COD income attributable to each discharged indebtedness. For example, if a taxpayer excludes $20 of COD income attributable to secured indebtedness A and excludes $80 of COD income attributable to unsecured indebtedness B (a total exclusion of $100), and if the taxpayer reduces tax attributes by $40 under sections 108(b)(2) (A) through (D), the taxpayer must reduce the amount of COD income attributable to secured indebtedness A to $12 ($20 - ($20 / $100 x $40)) and must reduce the amount of COD income attributable to unsecured indebtedness B to $48 ($80 - ($80 / $100 x $40)).
