() P and T each carry over net operating losses to Year 4 from a taxable year ending on the same date (that is, Year 3). The losses carried over from Year 3 total $180. However, the remaining Year 4 SRLY limit is $6. Therefore, the total amount of loss available for absorption is $126 ($120 allocable to P and $6 allocable to T). Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses available for absorption that are carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though one loss arises in a SRLY and the other loss does not. Thus, $36.19 of P's Year 3 loss is absorbed ($120/($120 + $6)) x $38 = $36.19. In addition, $1.81 of T's Year 3 loss is absorbed ($6/($120 + $6)) x $38 = $1.81.
