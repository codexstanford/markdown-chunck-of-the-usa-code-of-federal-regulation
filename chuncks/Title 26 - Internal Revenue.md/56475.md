####### Definition of real estate transaction,In general.

(b)-(1)A transaction is a "real estate transaction" under this section if the transaction consists in whole or in part of the sale or exchange of "reportable real estate" (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for money, indebtedness, property other than money, or services. The term "sale or exchange" shall include any transaction properly treated as a sale or exchange for Federal income tax purposes, whether or not the transaction is currently taxable. Thus, for example, a sale or exchange of a principal residence is a real estate transaction under this section even though the transferor is entitled to defer recognition under section 1034 (relating to rollover of gain on sale of principal residence), or the transferor is entitled to the special one-time exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence provided by section 121 to certain persons who have attained age 55.
