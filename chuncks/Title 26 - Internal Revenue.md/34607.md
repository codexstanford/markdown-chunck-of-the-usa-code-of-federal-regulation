(16)-(i)The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(15) of this section (the facts in) except that instead of a product liability lawsuit relating to a 2018 event, in 2019 there is a disaster at a warehouse owned by USP in the United States arising from the negligence of an employee. The warehouse is used to store Product A inventory intended for sale both by USP in the United States and by FDE in Country X. In 2020, the warehouse asset is characterized under ยง 1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii) as a multiple category asset that is assigned 10% to the foreign source foreign branch category, 50% to the foreign source general category, and 40% to the residual grouping of U.S. source income. The inventory of Product A in the warehouse is destroyed and USP employees as well as residents in the vicinity of the warehouse are injured. USP's reputation in the United States suffers such that USP expects to subsequently lose market share in the United States. In 2020, USP makes deductible damages payments totaling $50x to injured employees and the nearby residents, all of whom are in the United States.
