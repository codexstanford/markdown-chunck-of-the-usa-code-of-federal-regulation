####### Cumulative basis.

(6)Pursuant to section 995(d)(5), all determinations of amounts specified in this section are to be made on a cumulative basis from the 1st year (or date) provided for in this section. Thus, each such determination shall take into account a net increase or a net decrease during the year, as the case may be. However, if the 3-year limitation is elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, then only amounts with respect to periods specified in such subparagraph (5) are amounts taken into account for years before a member of the group qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. The computations described in this section may be made in any way chosen by the DISC (including a corporation being tested as to whether it qualifies as a DISC), provided such method results in the amount prescribed by this section.
