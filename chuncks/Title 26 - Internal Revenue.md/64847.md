###### ยง 31.3406(b)(2)-4 Reportable dividend payment.
####### Reinvested dividends.

(3)In the case of a dividend paid pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan, withholding under section 3406 applies, pursuant to ยง 31.3406(a)-4(a), at the time and to the amount made available to the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account. At the discretion of the payor, withholding under section 3406 need not be applied to any excess of the fair market value of the shares of stock received by the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account over the purchase price of the shares (including shares acquired by the shareholder at a discount in connection with the dividend distribution) or to any fee that is paid by the payor in the nature of a broker's fee for purchase of the stock or service charge for maintenance of the shareholder's account. The payor must, however, treat any excess amounts and fees on a consistent basis for each calendar year.
