####### Investing in loans,In general.

(3)-(i)The requirement that substantially all of an association's business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) must consist of investing in the loans described in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section ordinarily will be considered to be met for a taxable year if the association meets both the gross income test described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, and the sales activity test described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. However, if an association does not meet the requirements of both subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, it will nevertheless meet the investing in loans requirement if it is able to demonstrate that substantially all its business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) consisted of investing in the prescribed loans. Transactions which are necessitated by exceptional circumstances and which are not undertaken as recurring business activities for profit will not be considered a substantial part of an association's business. Thus, for example, an association would meet the investing in loans requirement if it can establish that it failed to meet the gross income test because of receipt of a non-recurring item of income due to exceptional circumstances, or it failed to meet the sales activity test because of sales made to achieve necessary liquidity to meet abnormal withdrawals from savings accounts. For the purposes of this subparagraph, however, the acquisition of loans in anticipation of their sale to other financial institutions does not constitute "investing" in loans, even though such acquisition and sale resulted from an excess of demand for loans over savings capital in the association's area.
