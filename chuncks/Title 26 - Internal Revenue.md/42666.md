###### § 1.987-4 Determination of net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of a section 987 QBU.
####### Analysis.

(B)Pursuant to § 1.987-2(c)(9)(iii), bicycle QBU and scooter QBU are separated QBUs, and the separation of Dutch QBU, a separating QBU, does not give rise to a transfer taken into account in determining the amount of a remittance (as defined in § 1.987-5(c)). For purposes of computing net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss under this section for Year 2, the separation will be deemed to have occurred on the last day of the owner's prior taxable year, Year 1. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, bicycle QBU will have a net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss of $120 (€600/€1,000 x $200), and scooter QBU will have a net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss of $80 (€400/€1,000 x $200).
