####### Example 5: Tax based on greater of tax in lieu of income tax or amount eligible for credit,1,Facts.,,

(E)-()Pursuant to a contract with Country X, Aa domestic corporation engaged in manufacturing activities in Country X, must pay tax to Country X equal to the greater of 5u (units of Country X currency) per item produced, or the maximum amount creditable by A against its U.S. income tax liability for that year with respect to income from its Country X operations. Also pursuant to the contract, A is exempted from Country X's otherwise generally-imposed net income tax. The contractual tax is a tax in lieu of income tax as defined in ยง 1.903-1(b). In Year 1, A produces 16 items, which would result in Country X tax of 16 x 5u = 80u, and taking into account the section 904 limitation, the maximum amount of Country X tax that A can claim as a credit against its U.S. income tax liability is 125u. Accordingly, A's contractual liability for Country X tax in lieu of income tax is 125u, the greater of the two amounts.
