####### Example 1.

(A)Entity A is a QOF that meets the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(1). Entity A owns qualified opportunity zone stock in a domestic corporation described in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B), which operates a hotel located in a qualified opportunity zone that qualifies as a trade or business. As part of that trade or business, the hotel operates a spa that provides massages and other therapies. Less than 5 percent of the hotel's total gross income is attributable to the spa, and less than 5 percent of the net rentable square feet for real property and less than 5 percent of the value for all other tangible property is attributable to the spa. As a result, the operation of the spa, which is a business described in section 144(c)(6)(B), will not prevent the operation of the hotel from qualifying as a qualified opportunity zone business.
