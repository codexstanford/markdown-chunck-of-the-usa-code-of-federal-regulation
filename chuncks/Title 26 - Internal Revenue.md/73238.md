####### § 301.6227-2 Determining and accounting for adjustments requested in an administrative adjustment request by the partnership.
######## Election to have adjustments resulting in an imputed underpayment taken into account by reviewed year partners.

(c)In lieu of paying an imputed underpayment under paragraph (b) of this section, the partnership may elect to have each reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) take into account the adjustments requested in the AAR that are associated with such imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6227-3. A partnership makes an election under this paragraph (c) at the time the AAR is filed in accordance with the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. If the partnership makes a valid election in accordance with this paragraph (c), the partnership is not liable for, nor required to pay, the imputed underpayment to which the election relates. Rather, each reviewed year partner must take into account their share of the adjustments requested in the AAR that are associated with such imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6227-3. If an election is made under this paragraph (c) with respect to an imputed underpayment, modifications applied under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to such imputed underpayment are disregarded and all adjustments requested in the AAR that are associated with such imputed underpayment must be taken into account by each reviewed year partner in accordance with § 301.6227-3.
