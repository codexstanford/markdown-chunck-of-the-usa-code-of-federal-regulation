####### Addition to tax of taking co-producer for production credit claimed on another co-producer's gas.

(C)If a taking co-producer claims a production credit on another co-producer's gas, the taking co-producer must add to its tax for the taxable year that it makes a payment to the other co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas any production credit allowed in an earlier taxable year on the gas sales to which the payment relates, but only to the extent the credit allowed actually reduced the taking co- producer's tax in any earlier year. The taking co-producer also must reduce the amount of its minimum tax credit allowable by reason of section 53(d)(1)(B)(iii) in the year of the payment or in a future year by the portion of the credit, if any, that relates to another co-producer's gas.
