####### Employer-provided limit.

(ii)An employer-provided limit is any limit on the elective deferrals an employee is permitted to make (without regard to section 414(v) and this section) that is contained in the terms of the plan, but which is not required under the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, for example, if, in accordance with the terms of the plan, highly compensated employees are limited to a deferral percentage of 10% of compensation, this limit is an employer-provided limit that is an applicable limit with respect to the highly compensated employees.
