####### Application in relevant possession.

(2)In applying the territorial income tax of the relevant possession, such possession generally will be treated, in a geographical and governmental sense, as including the United States. Thus, for example, income tax paid to the United States may be taken into account under sections 31, 6315, and 6402(b) as payments to the relevant possession. Moreover, a citizen of the United States (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) not a resident of the relevant possession will not be treated as a nonresident alien individual for purposes of the territorial income tax of the relevant possession. Thus, for example, a citizen of the United States (as so defined), or a resident of the United States, will not be treated as a nonresident alien individual for purposes of section 1361(b)(1)(C) of the Guam territorial income tax.
