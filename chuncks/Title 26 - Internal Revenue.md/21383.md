() At any relevant time the employee's vested portion of the separate account is not less than an amount ("X") determined by the formula: X = P(AB + (R x D))-(R x D). For purposes of applying the formula: P is the vested percentage at the relevant time; AB is the account balance at the relevant time; D is the amount of the distribution; R is the ratio of the account balance at the relevant time to the account balance after distribution; and the relevant time is the time at which, under the plan, the vested percentage in the account cannot increase.
