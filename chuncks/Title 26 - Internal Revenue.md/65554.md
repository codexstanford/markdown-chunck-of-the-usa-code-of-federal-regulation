####### Monthly depositor.

(ii)A taxpayer is a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) is $50,000 or less. A taxpayer ceases to be a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes on the first day after the taxpayer is subject to the One-Day rule in ยง 31.6302-1(c)(3) with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. At that time, the taxpayer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the succeeding calendar year. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of ยง 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.
