###### ยง 1.6050I-1 Returns relating to cash in excess of $10,000 received in a trade or business.
####### Receipt of cash not in the course of the recipient's trade or business.

(3)The receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 by a person other than in the course of the person's trade or business is not reportable under section 6050I. Thus, for example, F, an individual in the trade or business of selling real estate, sells a motorboat for $12,000, the purchase price of which is paid in cash. F did not use the motorboat in any trade or business in which F was engaged. F is not required to report under section 6050I or these regulations because the exception provided in this paragraph (d)(3) applies.
