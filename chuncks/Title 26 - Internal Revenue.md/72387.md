####### ยง 301.6104(d)-3 Tax-exempt organization subject to harassment campaign.
######## In general.

(a)If the district director for the key district in which the organization's principal office is located (or such other person as the Commissioner may designate) determines that the organization is the subject of a harassment campaign and compliance with the requests that are part of the harassment campaign would not be in the public interest, a tax-exempt organization is not required to fulfill a request for a copy (as otherwise required by ยง 301.6104(d)-1(a)) that it reasonably believes is part of the campaign.
