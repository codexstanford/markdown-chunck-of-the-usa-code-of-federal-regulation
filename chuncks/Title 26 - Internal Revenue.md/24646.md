####### Example 1: Provision of installation services,Facts.

(i)-(A)In 2021, B enters into a 2-year service contract with a customer to install the customer's manufacturing equipment for $100,000. Throughout the term of the contract, the customer retains control of the equipment. B begins providing the installation services in 2021 and completes the installation services in 2022. Under the contract, B bills the customer $55,000 in 2021 when installation begins, but does not have a fixed right to receive the remaining $45,000 until installation is complete and approved by the customer. However, if the customer were to terminate the contract prior to completion, B would have an enforceable right to payment for all services performed prior to the termination date. For its AFS, B reports $60,000 of AFS revenue for 2021 and $40,000 of AFS revenue for 2022, in accordance with the services performed in each respective year.
