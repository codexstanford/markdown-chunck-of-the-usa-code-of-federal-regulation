####### Stock ownership presumptions in connection with certain acquisitions, and dispositions of loss corporation stock,In general.

(5)-(i)For purposes of this section-

(A) If an individual owns less than five percent of the stock of a loss corporation during the testing period (excluding the testing date) and acquires an amount of such stock so that the individual becomes a 5-percent shareholder on the testing date, the loss corporation may treat any interest in the loss corporation owned by such individual prior to that acquisition as owned by a public group during the period of such individual's ownership of that interest and as not owned by the 5-percent shareholder during the same period, and

(B) If a 5-percent shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the loss corporation is reduced to less than five percent, the loss corporation may presume that the remaining stock owned by such 5-percent shareholder immediately after such reduction is the stock owned by such shareholder for each subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes the date on which the reduction occurred as long as such shareholder continues to own less than five percent of the stock of the loss corporation. In that event, such ownership interest shall be treated as owned by a separate public group for purposes of the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(vi) of this section.
