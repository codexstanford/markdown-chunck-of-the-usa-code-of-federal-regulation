(iii)For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), references to a covered member do not include references to any corporation of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor. Accordingly, a distribution or acquisition by a covered member described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) is reduced solely by the expanded group earnings account of the covered member (taking into account the application of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(F)() of this section) and the qualified contributions of the covered member (taking into account the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)() of this section), notwithstanding that the distribution or acquisition is treated as made by a funded member of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor.
