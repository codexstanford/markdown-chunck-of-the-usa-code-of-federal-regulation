####### ยง 301.6225-1 Partnership adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.
######## Example 1.

(1)Partnership reports on its 2019 partnership return $100 of ordinary income and an ordinary deduction of -$70. The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year and determines that ordinary income was $105 instead of $100 ($5 adjustment) and that the ordinary deduction was -$80 instead of -$70 (-$10 adjustment). Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the adjustments are both in the residual grouping. The -$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction would not have been netted at the partnership level with the $5 adjustment to ordinary income and would not have been required to be allocated to the partners of the partnership as a single partnership-related item for purposes of section 702(a), other provision of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS. Because the -$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction would result in a decrease in the imputed underpayment if netted with the $5 adjustment to ordinary income and because it might be limited if taken into account by any person, the -$10 adjustment must be placed in a separate subgrouping from the $5 adjustment to ordinary income. See paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. The total netted partnership adjustment is $5, which results in an imputed underpayment of $2. The -$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction is a net negative amount and is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment which is taken into account by Partnership in the adjustment year in accordance with ยง 301.6225-3.
