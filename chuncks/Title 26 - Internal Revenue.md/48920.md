####### Example 6,Facts.

(vi)-(A)Individuals intend to sell stock at a capital gain and invest the resulting gain in a QOF pursuant to a deferral election under section 1400Z-2(a). The individuals form Entity F and file Form 8996 certifying that Entity F is a QOF organized for the purpose of investing in qualified opportunity zone property. Individuals have no intention of investing in qualified opportunity zone property. Instead individuals intend to invest in property other than qualified opportunity zone property hoping that the property will appreciate substantially in value and the individuals will be able to exclude any appreciation on their investment from gross income by making an election under section 1400Z-2(c). Each year Entity F files Form 8996 and pays the applicable penalty under section 1400Z-2(f). After holding their interests in Entity F for 10 years, individuals sell their interest in Entity F to an unrelated third party for a substantial gain and make an election to exclude the appreciation on their investment under section 1400Z-2(c).
