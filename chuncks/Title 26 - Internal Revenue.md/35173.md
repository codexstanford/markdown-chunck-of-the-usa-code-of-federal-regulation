####### Effect of cost sharing arrangements.

(iv)If the controlled party has entered into a cost sharing arrangement, in accordance with the provisions of ยง 1.482-7, with the taxpayer for the purpose of developing intangible property, then ordinarily the controlled party is not reasonably expected to acquire rights in intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's share of the R&E expenditures with respect to the cost shared intangibles as defined in ยง 1.482-7(j)(1)(i); acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property. Therefore, solely for purposes of apportioning a taxpayer's R&E expenditures (which do not include the amount of CST Payments received by the taxpayer; see paragraph (a) of this section) that are intangible development costs (as defined in ยง 1.482-7(d)) with respect to a cost sharing arrangement, the controlled party's gross receipts are not taken into account for purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(4)(i) of this section. However, the rule in this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) does not apply, and the controlled party's sales are taken into account, to the extent the taxpayer licenses, or has licensed, to the controlled party intangible property resulting from a cost sharing arrangement with the controlled party.
