###### ยง 1.812-2 Operations loss deduction.
####### Allowance of deduction.

(a)Section 812 provides that a life insurance company shall be allowed a deduction in computing gain or loss from operations for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, in an amount equal to the aggregate of the operations loss carryovers and operations loss carrybacks to such taxable year. This deduction is referred to as the operations loss deduction. The loss from operations (computed under section 809), is the basis for the computation of the operations loss carryovers and operations loss carrybacks and ultimately for the operations loss deduction itself. Section 809(e)(5) provides that the net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed a life insurance company since the operations loss deduction provided in section 812 and this paragraph shall be allowed in lieu thereof.
