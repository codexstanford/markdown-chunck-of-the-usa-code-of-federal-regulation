####### Analysis.

(ii)US1 is a specified party and thus a deduction for its $50x specified payment is subject to disallowance under section 267A. As described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, the entire $50x payment is a disqualified hybrid amount under the hybrid transaction rule of ยง 1.267A-2(a) and, as a result, a deduction for the payment is disallowed under ยง 1.267A-1(b)(1).
