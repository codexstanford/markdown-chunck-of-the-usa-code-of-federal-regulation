(4)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (e)(3) of this section, except that PR notifies the IRS that Partnership will be requesting modification. On January 5, 2026, PR and the IRS agree to extend the period for requesting modification pursuant to section 6225(c)(7) and ยง 301.6225-2(c)(3)(ii) for 45 days-from February 27, 2026 to April 13, 2026. PR submits the request for modification to the IRS on April 13, 2026. Therefore, the date determined under paragraph (b) of this section is February 22, 2027, which is 270 days after the date everything required to be submitted was so submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section plus the additional 45-day extension of the period for requesting modification agreed to by PR and the IRS. Because February 22, 2027 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section) and the date under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (June 12, 2026, which is 330 days from the date the NOPPA was mailed plus the 45-day extension under section 6225(c)(7)), February 22, 2027 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.
