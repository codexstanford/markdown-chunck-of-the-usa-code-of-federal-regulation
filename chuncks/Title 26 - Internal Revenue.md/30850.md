(e)-(1)In the case of transfers to pooled income funds for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, and before May 1, 1999, the present value of a remainder interest is determined under this section. See, however, ยง 1.7520-3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). The present value of a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual is computed by the use of Table S in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. For purposes of the computations under this section, the age of an individual is the age at the individual's nearest birthday. If the valuation date of a transfer to a pooled income fund is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely on Notice 89-24, 1989-1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89-60, 1989-1 C.B. 700, in valuing the transferred interest. (See ยง 601.601(d)(2)(ii)() of this chapter.)
