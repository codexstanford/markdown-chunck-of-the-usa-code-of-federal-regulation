####### Tax-paid tires or inner tubes used in further manufacture.

(d)(1) A payment of tax under section 4071 on the sale prior to January 1, 1984, of a tire or inner tube, directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3)(C) if the subsequent manufacturer sells the tire or inner tube on or in connection with, or with the sale of, any other article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer and if the other article is-

(i) An automobile bus chassis or automobile bus body, or

(ii) By any person (A) exported to a foreign country or to a possession of the United States, (B) sold to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia for the exclusive use of a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, (C) sold to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use, or (D) used or sold for use as supplies to vessels or aircraft.

For tax-paid tires used in further manufacture after December 31, 1983, see section 6416(b)(3)(A) and the regulations thereunder.

(2) The overpayment in this paragraph (d) is to be distinguished from that overpayment described in section 6416(b)(2)(E) and ยง 48.6416(b)(2)-2(f) in that this overpayment arises from the "use" described in this paragraph, whereas the overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(E) arises from the "resale" of tax-paid tires or inner tubes by any person to a subsequent manufacturer who disposes of the articles on or in connection with, or with the sale of, a second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer which is disposed of on the basis of one of the exemptions set forth in section 6416(b)(3)(C).

(3) If the second article is exported or shipped as provided in this paragraph (d), it is immaterial whether the subsequent manufacturer sold the article with the knowledge that it would be exported or shipped.

(4) An overpayment arises under paragraph (d)(1) of this section only if the tire or inner tube constitutes a part of, or is associated with, the second article at the time the second article is exported, shipped, sold, used, or sold for use, as prescribed in this paragraph.

(5) For definition of certain terms used in this paragraph, see section 4221 and the regulations thereunder.

(6) For provisions relating to overpayments arising by reason of tires or inner tubes sold tax-paid by the manufacturer of the same, on or in connection with, or with the sale of, any article manufactured or produced by that manufacturer and exported, sold, or used or sold for use, as provided in this paragraph (d), see section 6416(b)(4).

(7) For provisions relating to credit allowable in respect of tires and inner tubes sold on or in connection with, or with the sale of, another article taxable under chapter 32, prior to January 1, 1984, see section 6416(c) and ยง 48.6416(c)-1.

(8) If a second article referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is sold for a use described in that paragraph and is not so used, this paragraph (d) is in all respects inapplicable.
