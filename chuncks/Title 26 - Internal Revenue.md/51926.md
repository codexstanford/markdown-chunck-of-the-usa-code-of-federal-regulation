###### § 1.1474-6 Coordination of chapter 4 with other withholding provisions.
####### Distribution from a United States real property holding corporation.

(ii)A distribution (or portion of a distribution) from a United States real property holding corporation (or from a corporation that was a United States real property holding corporation at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution) with respect to its stock that is a United States real property interest under section 897(c) is subject to withholding under chapter 4 and is also subject to the withholding provisions of section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) and section 1445. In such case, to the extent that the United States real property holding corporation chooses to withhold on a distribution only under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) pursuant to § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(A), the coordination rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply to such distribution. Alternatively, to the extent that the United States real property holding corporation chooses to withhold under both section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) and section 1445 pursuant to § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(B), the coordination rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply to the portion of such distribution described in § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(B)(1), and withholding under section 1445 shall apply to the amount of such distribution described in § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(B)(2). A withholding agent other than a United States real property holding corporation may rely, absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, on the representations of the United States real property holding corporation making the distribution regarding the portion of the distribution that is estimated to be a dividend under § 1.1441-3(c)(2)(ii)(A), and in the case of a failure by the withholding agent to withhold under chapter 4 due to this reliance, the required amount shall be imputed to the United States real property holding corporation.
