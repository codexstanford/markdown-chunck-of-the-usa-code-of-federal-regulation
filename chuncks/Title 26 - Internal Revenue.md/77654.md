####### Employees' account numbers.

(2)Each employee (or individual making a return of net earnings from self-employment) who does not have an account number must file an application on Form SS-5, a copy of which may be obtained from any district office of the Social Security Administration or from a district director of internal revenue. The form, after execution in accordance with the instructions thereon, must be filed with the district office of the Social Security Administration, and at a later date the employee will be furnished an account number. The employee must furnish such number to each employer for whom the employee works, in order that such number may be entered on each tax return filed thereafter by the employer.
