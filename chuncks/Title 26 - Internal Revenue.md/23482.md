###### ยง 1.430(h)(3)-2 Plan-specific substitute mortality tables used to determine present value.
####### Option to determine a single mortality ratio for both genders.

(6)Base substitute mortality tables for a plan may be constructed by developing and applying a single mortality ratio for both genders, but only if the substitute mortality tables used for all plans maintained by members of the plan sponsor's controlled group (except for plans for which both the male and female populations, considered separately, have mortality experience with full credibility) are constructed in this manner. If the option under this paragraph (d)(6) is applied for a plan then, for all plans maintained by members of the plan sponsor's controlled group, whether both the male and female populations within the plan have credible mortality information (and, if that combined population's mortality experience does not have full credibility, the partial credibility weighting factor for the plan) is determined using the combined mortality experience for both genders.
