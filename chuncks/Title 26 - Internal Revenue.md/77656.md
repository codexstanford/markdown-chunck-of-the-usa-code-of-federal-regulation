####### Adjustments by employers,Undercollections and underpayments,Employer tax or employee tax.

(c)-(1)-(i)If a return is filed by an employer under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the employer reports and pays less than the correct amount of employer tax or employee tax, the employer is required to report and pay the additional amount due. The reporting will be an adjustment without interest only if the employer reports and pays the additional amount on or before the last day on which the return is required to be filed for the return period in which the error is ascertained. The employer may so report the additional amount either on the return for that period or on a supplemental return for the period for which the underpayment was made. If the employer fails to report the additional amount due within the time so fixed for making an interest-free adjustment, the employer nevertheless is required to report the additional amount in the same manner, but interest will be due. No adjustment of an underpayment may be made under this section or ยง 31.6205-1(b)(2) if the employer is sent a notice and demand for payment of the additional tax.
