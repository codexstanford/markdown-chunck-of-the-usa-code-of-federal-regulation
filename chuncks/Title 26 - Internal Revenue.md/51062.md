####### GIIN verification,In general.

(3)-(i)A withholding agent that has received a payee's claim of status as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, and that is required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section to confirm that the FFI or branch thereof (including an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the FFI) claiming status as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI has a GIIN that appears on the published IRS FFI list, has reason to know that such payee is not such a financial institution if the payee's name (including a name reasonably similar to the name the withholding agent has on file for the payee) and GIIN do not appear on the most recently published IRS FFI list within 90 days of the date that the claim is made. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(i), the GIIN that the withholding agent must confirm is, with respect to a payee that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, the GIIN assigned to the FFI identifying its country of residence for tax purposes (or place of organization if the FFI has no country of residence) or, with respect to a payment that is made to a branch (including a disregarded entity) of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI located outside of the FFI's country of residence or organization, the GIIN of the branch (or disregarded entity) receiving the payment. The withholding agent will have reason to know that a withholdable payment is made to a branch (including a disregarded entity) of a participating or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is not itself a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI when the withholding agent is directed to make the payment to an address in a jurisdiction other than that of the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (or branch (including a disregarded entity) of such FFI) that is identified as the FFI (or branch (including a disregarded entity) of such FFI) that is supposed to receive the payment and for which the FFI's GIIN is not confirmed as described in the preceding sentence. The preceding sentence does not apply to an FFI that is an investment entity. If an FFI (other than an investment entity) directs the withholding agent to make the payment to an account held by the FFI and maintained by another financial institution, the FFI must provide to the withholding agent a statement in writing that the FFI is not directing the payment to any branch of such FFI that is not a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI. An FFI whose registration with the IRS as a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI is in process but has not yet received a GIIN may provide a withholding agent with a Form W-8 claiming the chapter 4 status it applied for and writing "applied for" in the box for the GIIN. In such case, the withholding agent will have 90 days from the date it receives the Form W-8 to obtain a GIIN and to verify the accuracy of the GIIN against the published IRS FFI list before it has reason to know that the payee is not a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. If an FFI is removed from the published IRS FFI list, the withholding agent knows that such FFI is not a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI on the earlier of the date that the withholding agent discovers that the FFI has been removed from the list or the date that is one year from the date the FFI's GIIN was actually removed from the list.
