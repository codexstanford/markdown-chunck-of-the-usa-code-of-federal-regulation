####### Result.

(ii)There is no recapture of the year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to P's Country X separate unit because it is reduced to zero under ยง 1.1503(d)-6(h)(2)(i). However, P is liable for one year of interest charge under ยง 1.1503(d)-6(h)(1)(ii), even though P's recapture amount is zero. This is the case because the P consolidated group had the benefit of the dual consolidated loss in year 1, and the income that offset the recapture income was not recognized until year 2. Pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-6(j)(1)(iii), the domestic use agreement filed by the P consolidated group with respect to the year 1 dual consolidated loss is terminated and has no further effect.
