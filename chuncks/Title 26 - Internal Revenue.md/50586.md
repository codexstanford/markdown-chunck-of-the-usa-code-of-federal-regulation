(11)The termmeans any person, U.S. or foreign, that, in the ordinary course of a trade or business during the calendar year, stands ready to effect sales to be made by others. Examples of a broker include an obligor that regularly issues and retires its own debt obligations, a corporation that regularly redeems its own stock, and a clearing organization that effects sales of securities for its members. A broker does not include an international organization described in ยง 1.1471-6(c) that redeems or retires an obligation of which it is the issuer, a stock transfer agent that records transfers of stock for a corporation if the nature of the activities of the agent is such that the agent ordinarily would not know the gross proceeds from sales, an escrow agent that effects no sales other than transactions incidental to the purpose of the escrow (such as sales to collect on collateral), or a corporation that issues and retires long-term debt on an irregular basis.
