####### Amount of money and other property received with respect to the sale,In general.

(2)-(i)Amounts of money and other property received by the seller with respect to the sale of the property include payments made by the purchaser for the seller's benefit, as well as payments made and other property transferred directly to the seller. If the purchaser of the real property makes payments on a mortgage or other indebtedness to which the property is subject at the time of the sale of such property to him, or on which the seller was personally liable at the time of such sale, such payments are considered amounts received by the seller with respect to the sale. However, if after the sale the purchaser borrows money and uses the property as security for the loan, payments by the purchaser in satisfaction of the indebtedness are not considered as amounts received by the seller with respect to the sale, although the seller does in fact receive some indirect benefit when the purchaser makes such payments.
