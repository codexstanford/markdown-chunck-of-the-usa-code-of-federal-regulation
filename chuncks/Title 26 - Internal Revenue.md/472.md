(ii) Under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section, only the incentives related to tobacco use are counted toward the premium amount used to determine the affordability of X's plan. C is treated as having earned the $300 incentive for attending a smoking cessation course regardless of whether C actually attends the course. Thus, the required contribution for determining affordability for both Employee B and Employee C is $3,700. The $200 incentive for completing cholesterol screening is treated as not earned and does not reduce their required contribution.
