####### Example 7: Sale of property using a special method of accounting.

(vii)In 2021, H, a financial services provider, sells a building for $100,000, payable in five annual payments of $20,000 together with adequate stated interest, starting in 2021. For its AFS, H reports $100,000 of AFS revenue for 2021 from the sale of the building. For Federal income tax purposes, H uses the installment method under section 453 for the sale of the building. Because the installment method under section 453 is a special method of accounting under paragraphs (a)(13)(ii) and (b)(3)(i) of this section, the AFS income inclusion rule does not apply to H's sale of the building. Accordingly, the gain from the sale is included in income as prescribed in section 453.
