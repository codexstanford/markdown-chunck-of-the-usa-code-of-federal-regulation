###### § 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Ineligible nonlife member.

(vi)(A) The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss that arises in any consolidated return year (that may be set off against consolidated LICTI in the current taxable year or in a succeeding taxable year) is the amount computed under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section reduced by the ineligible NOL. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), the "ineligible NOL" is in the year the loss arose the amount of the separate net operating loss (determined under §§ 1.1502-21(b) of any nonlife member that is ineligible in that year (and not the portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss attributable under §§ 1.1502-21(b) to such a member).

(B) The carryovers of offsetable nonlife net operating losses under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section do not include an ineligible NOL arising in a consolidated return year or a loss attributable to an ineligible member arising in a separate return year. See section 1503(c)(2). (C) For absorption within the nonlife subgroup of an ineligible NOL arising in a consolidated return year or a loss of an ineligible member arising in a separate return year which is not a separate return limitation year under paragraph (h)(3)(ix) of this section, see paragraph (h)(3)(vii) of this section.
