For example, executors' commissions and attorneys' fees that are not yet paid, and that meet the requirements for deductibility under ยง 20.2053-3(b) and (c), respectively, are deemed to be ascertainable with reasonable certainty and may be deducted if such expenses will be paid.

To the extent a claim or expense is contested or contingent, such a claim or expense cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty.
