####### Exception for certain incorrectly surrendered property.

(2)Any person who surrenders to the Internal Revenue Service property or rights to property not properly subject to levy in which the delinquent taxpayer has no apparent interest is not relieved of liability to a third party who has an interest in the property. However, if the delinquent taxpayer has an apparent interest in property or rights to property, a person who makes a good faith determination that such property or rights to property in his or her possession has been levied upon by the Internal Revenue Service and who surrenders the property to the United States in response to the levy is relived of liability to a third party who has an interest in the property or rights to property, even if it is subsequently determined that the property was not properly subject to levy.
