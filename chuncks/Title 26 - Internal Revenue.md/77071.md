###### ยง 509.105 Industrial and commercial profits.
####### General.

(a)(1) Article III of the convention adopts the principle that an enterprise of one of the contracting States shall not be taxable by the other contracting State upon its industrial and commercial profits unless it is engaged in trade or business in the latter State through a permanent establishment situated therein. Accordingly, a Swiss enterprise is subject to United States tax upon its industrial and commercial profits, to the extent of such profits from sources within the United States, only if it is engaged in trade or business in the United States at some time during the taxable year through a permanent establishment situated therein.

(2) From the standpoint of the United States tax the article has application only to a Swiss enterprise and its industrial and commercial profits from sources within the United States. Thus, a nonresident alien individual who is a citizen of Switzerland, or a Swiss corporation or other entity, carrying on an enterprise which is not Swiss, is subject to tax on such income of such enterprise pursuant to section 871(c) or section 882(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1954, if such alien, corporation, or other entity has engaged in trade or business in the United States at any time during the taxable year, even though it has not had a permanent establishment therein at any time within such year.
