###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Aggregation of items of income in each other separate category.

(ii)For purposes of applying the general rule of paragraph (k)(1) of this section, items of income in each other separate category of income that are resourced under each applicable treaty are aggregated in a single separate category for income in that separate category that is resourced under that treaty. For example, all items of passive category income that would otherwise be treated as derived from sources within the United States but which the taxpayer chooses to treat as arising from sources outside the United States pursuant to a provision of a bilateral U.S. income tax treaty are treated as income in a separate category for passive category income resourced under the particular treaty, and the high-tax kickout grouping rules of paragraph (c) of this section are applied separately to the groups of passive income included in that separate category. Any items of resourced high-taxed passive income are assigned to a separate category for general (or other) category income resourced under a tax treaty. Items of income described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section are not combined with other income that is foreign source income under the Code, even if the other income arises from sources within the jurisdiction with which the United States has a bilateral income tax treaty ("treaty jurisdiction") and is included in the same separate category to which the resourced income would be assigned without regard to section 904(d)(6). Items of income described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section are also not combined with other items of resourced income that are subject to a separate limitation by reason of a Code provision other than section 904(d)(6).
