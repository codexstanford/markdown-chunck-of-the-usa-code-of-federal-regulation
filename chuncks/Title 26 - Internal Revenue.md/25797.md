####### Allocation of fixed rent within a period.

(4)A rental agreement that allocates fixed rent to any period is treated as allocating fixed rent ratably within that period. Thus, if a rental agreement provides that $120,000 is allocated to each calendar year in the lease term, $10,000 of rent is allocated to each calendar month.
