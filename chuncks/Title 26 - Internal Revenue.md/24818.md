(C)The same facts as in paragraph (h)(4)(ii)(B) of this section () apply, except that A uses the method described in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(C) of this section. For the taxable year 2021, A uses the financial results reported on its June 30, 2021 AFS to determine whether an item of gross income is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" as of the end of its 2021 taxable year. Accordingly, any AFS revenue reported on the taxpayer's June 30, 2022 AFS is disregarded when determining whether an item of gross income is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" as of the end of the 2021 taxable year.
