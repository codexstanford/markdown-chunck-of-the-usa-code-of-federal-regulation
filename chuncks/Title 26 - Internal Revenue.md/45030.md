####### Definition of capital interest and profits interest.

(ii)For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), a profits interest is a partnership interest other than a capital interest. A capital interest is an interest that would give the holder a share of the proceeds if the partnership's assets were sold at fair market value at the time the interest was received and then the proceeds were distributed in a complete liquidation of the partnership. A profits interest, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), is received in connection with the performance of services to or for the benefit of a partnership in a partner capacity or in anticipation of being a partner, and the receipt of the interest is not treated as a taxable event for the partner or the partnership under applicable Federal income tax guidance.
