###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Section 865(h).

(2)If any gain, as defined in section 865(h)(2)(A)(i), would be treated as derived from sources within the United States under section 865, but pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States such gain would be treated as arising from sources outside the United States, and the taxpayer chooses the benefits of such treaty obligation, then that gain will be treated as foreign source income. However, sections 904(a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g) and sections 907 and 960 are applied separately to amounts described in the preceding sentence with respect to each treaty under which the taxpayer has claimed benefits and, within each treaty, to each separate category of income. The principles of the rules in paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section apply to gains, and foreign taxes on gains, that are subject to a separate limitation under section 865(h).
