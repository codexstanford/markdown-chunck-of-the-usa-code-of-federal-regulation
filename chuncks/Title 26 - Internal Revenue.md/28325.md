####### FAP application

(13)means the information and accompanying documentation that an individual submits to apply for financial assistance under a hospital facility's FAP. An individual is considered to have submitted a complete FAP application if he or she provides information and documentation sufficient for the hospital facility to determine whether the individual is FAP-eligible and an incomplete FAP application if he or she provides some, but not sufficient, information and documentation to determine FAP-eligibility. The term "FAP application" does not refer only to written submissions, and a hospital facility may obtain information from an individual in writing or orally (or a combination of both).
