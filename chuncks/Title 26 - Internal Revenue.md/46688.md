####### De minimis OID.

(a)If the original issue discount determined under section 1286(a) with respect to the purchase of a stripped bond or stripped coupon is less than the amount computed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1273(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder, then the amount of original issue discount with respect to that purchase (other than any tax-exempt portion thereof, determined under section 1286(d)(2)) shall be considered to be zero. For purposes of this computation, the number of complete years to maturity is measured from the date the stripped bond or stripped coupon is purchased.
