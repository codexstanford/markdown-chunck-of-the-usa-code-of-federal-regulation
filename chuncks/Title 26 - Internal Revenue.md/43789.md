####### 4,Analysis of the second tier of the fallback waterfall.,1,Example 2,1,Example 2

()The fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is the same as the fallback rate in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B)() of this section (). However, unlike the fallback rate in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B)() of this section (), the likelihood that the amount of interest on the debt instrument will ever be determined by reference to the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is remote. Accordingly, under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is treated as satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate.
