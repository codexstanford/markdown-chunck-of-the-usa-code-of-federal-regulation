####### Issue date of a contract,In general.

(3)-(i)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the issue date of a contract is the issue date assigned to the contract by the insurance company. In no event is the issue date earlier than the date the policyholder submitted a signed application for coverage to the insurance company. If the period between the date the signed application is submitted to the insurance company and the date coverage under which the contract actually becomes effective is substantially longer than under the insurance company's usual business practice, then the issue date is the later of the date coverage under which the contract becomes effective or the issue date assigned to the contract by the insurance company. A policyholder's right to return a contract within a free-look period following delivery for a full refund of any premiums paid is not taken into account in determining the contract's issue date.
