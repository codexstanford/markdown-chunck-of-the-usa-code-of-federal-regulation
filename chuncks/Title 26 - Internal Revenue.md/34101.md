###### ยง 1.857-2 Real estate investment trust taxable income and net capital gain.
####### Deduction for dividends paid for purposes of the alternative tax.

(iii)The rules in section 857(b)(3)(A) apply in determining the amount of the deduction for dividends paid that is taken into account in computing the alternative tax. Thus, for example, if a real estate investment trust has net income from foreclosure property for a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, then for purposes of determining the partial tax described in section 857(b)(3)(A)(i), the amount of the deduction for dividends paid is computed pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, except that capital gains dividends are excluded from the dividends paid or considered as paid during the taxable year, and the net capital gain is excluded in computing real estate investment trust taxable income.
