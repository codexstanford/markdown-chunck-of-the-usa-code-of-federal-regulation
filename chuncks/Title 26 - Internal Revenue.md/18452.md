###### ยง 1.381(c)(19)-1 Charitable contribution carryovers in certain acquisitions.
####### Rules governing amounts deductible by acquiring corporations.

(d)(1) In applying the provisions of section 170(b)(2) (or, if applicable, section 170(d)(2)) for the purpose of determining the amount of excess charitable contributions which are deductible by the acquiring corporation in its taxable years beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to a particular taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, constitute the same numbered preceding taxable year shall together be considered as a 1 taxable year even though the taxable years involved may not end on the same date. Thus, for example, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, constitutes the second preceding taxable year shall together be considered as 1 taxable year even though the taxable years involved may not end on the same date. Any excess charitable contributions carried over from preceding taxable years which are considered as 1 taxable year shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation as one amount, without regard to the extent to which the contributions were made by a distributor or transferor corporation or the acquiring corporation.

(2) For purposes of this paragraph, each taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation beginning on or before the date of distribution or transfer shall be treated as a preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's taxable years beginning after such date. For example, the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer shall be considered a first preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's first taxable year beginning after that date, a second preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's second taxable year beginning after that date, and so forth with respect to succeeding taxable years of the acquiring corporation. Also, for example, the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation which immediately precedes its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer shall be considered a second preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's first taxable year beginning after that date.
