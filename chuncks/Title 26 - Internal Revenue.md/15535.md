####### Acquisition of stock or assets of several corporations.

(c)An issuing corporation which acquires stock in, or assets of, more than one corporation during any taxable year must apply the tests described in section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) separately with respect to each obligation issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of the stock in, or assets of, each such acquired corporation. Thus, if an acquisition is made with obligations of the issuing corporation that satisfy the tests described in section 279(b) (2) and (3) and obligations that fail to satisfy such tests, only those obligations satisfying such tests need be further considered to determine whether they constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness. Those obligations which meet the test of section 279(b)(1) but which are not deemed corporate acquisition indebtedness shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the reduction in the $5 million limitation of section 279(a)(1).
