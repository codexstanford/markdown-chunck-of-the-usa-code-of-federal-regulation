####### Automatic consent.

(2)The Commissioner grants consent for an issuer to change its method of accounting for bond issuance premium on debt instruments issued on or after March 2, 1998. Because this change is made on a cut-off basis, no items of income or deduction are omitted or duplicated and, therefore, no adjustment under section 481 is allowed. The consent granted by this paragraph (h)(2) applies provided-

(i) The change is made to comply with this section;

(ii) The change is made for the first taxable year for which the issuer must account for a debt instrument under this section; and

(iii) The issuer attaches to its federal income tax return for the taxable year containing the change a statement that it has changed its method of accounting under this section.
