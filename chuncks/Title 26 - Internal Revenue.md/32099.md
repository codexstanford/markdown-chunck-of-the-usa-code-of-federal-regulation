()An item of gross income is assigned to the activity that generates the item of income that is recognized for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Consequently, disregarded payments are not taken into account in determining the amount of net income attributable to an activity, although a special allocation of income used to make a disregarded payment may result in the subdivision of an activity into divisible parts. See paragraph (b)(4)(viii)()()() of this section,in paragraph (b)(5)(xxiv) of this section, andandin paragraphs (b)(6)(ii) and (iii), respectively, of this section (relating to inter-branch payments).
