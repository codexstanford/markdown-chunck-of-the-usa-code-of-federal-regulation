###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Acquisitions are part of the same series of related transactions.

(iv)The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, except that X's acquisition of the Parent stock and B's purchase of Equipment #4 are part of the same series of related transactions. Thus, pursuant to the same series of related transactions, S became a member of the X group and B (another member of the X group) acquired Equipment #4. Because S had a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 within the lookback period, B is treated as having a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 under the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule. As a result, B's acquisition of Equipment #4 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement, and B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #4 in 2020.
