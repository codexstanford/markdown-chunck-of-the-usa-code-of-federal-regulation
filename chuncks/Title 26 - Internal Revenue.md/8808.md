###### ยง 1.165-11 Election to take disaster loss deduction for preceding year.
####### Requirement to file consistent returns.

(d)A taxpayer may not make a section 165(i) election for a disaster loss if the taxpayer claims a deduction (as a loss, as cost of goods sold, or otherwise) for the same loss for the disaster year. If a taxpayer has claimed a deduction for a disaster loss for the disaster year and the taxpayer wants to make a section 165(i) election with respect to that loss, the taxpayer must file an amended Federal income tax return to remove the previously deducted loss on or before the date that the taxpayer makes the section 165(i) election for the loss. Similarly, if a taxpayer has claimed a deduction for a disaster loss for the preceding year based on a section 165(i) election and the taxpayer wants to revoke that election, the taxpayer must file an amended Federal income tax return to remove the loss for the preceding year on or before the date the taxpayer files the Federal income tax return or amended Federal income tax return for the disaster year that includes the loss.
