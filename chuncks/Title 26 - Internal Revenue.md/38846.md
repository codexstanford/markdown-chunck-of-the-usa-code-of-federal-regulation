###### § 1.905-4 Notification of foreign tax redetermination.
####### Partnerships subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code.

(ii)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if a redetermination of U.S. tax liability that is required under § 1.905-3(b) by reason of a foreign tax redetermination described in § 1.905-3(a) would require a partnership adjustment as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6) of this chapter, the partnership must file an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 and make any adjustments required under section 6227. See §§ 301.6227-2 and 301.6227-3 of this chapter for procedures for making adjustments with respect to an administrative adjustment request. An administrative adjustment request required under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the partnership's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs, and the restrictions in section 6227(c) do not apply to such filing. However, unless the administrative adjustment request may otherwise be filed after applying the limitations contained in section 6227(c), such a request is limited to adjustments that are required to be made under section 905(c). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are deemed to be satisfied with respect to any item taken into account in an administrative adjustment request filed under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).
