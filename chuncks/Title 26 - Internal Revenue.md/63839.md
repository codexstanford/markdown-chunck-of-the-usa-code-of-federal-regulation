(i) In respect of each employee, make an estimate of the amount of tips that will be reported, pursuant to section 6053(a), by the employee to the employer in a calendar quarter.

(ii) Determine the amount which must be deducted upon each payment of wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer to be made during the quarter by the employer to the employee in order to collect from the employee during the quarter an amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the estimated quarterly tips by the sum of the rates of tax under subsections (a) and (b) of section 3101.

(iii) Deduct from any payment of such employee's wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer, or from funds referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount of tax withheld on the estimated basis to conform to the amount of employee tax imposed upon, and required to be deducted in respect of, tips reported by the employee to the employer during the calendar quarter in written statements furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a). If an adjustment is required, the additional employee tax required to be collected may be deducted upon any payment of the employee's wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer during the quarter and within the first 30 days following the quarter or from funds turned over by the employee to the employer for such purposes within such period.
