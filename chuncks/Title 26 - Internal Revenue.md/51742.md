####### Late-joining sponsored direct reporting NFFEs.

(ii)In general, with respect to a certification period, a sponsoring entity is not required to make a certification for a sponsored direct reporting NFFE that first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity during the six-month period before the end of the sponsoring entity's certification period, provided that the sponsoring entity makes certifications for such sponsored direct reporting NFFE for subsequent certification periods, and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the sponsoring entity during which the sponsored direct reporting NFFE was sponsored by the sponsoring entity. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to a sponsored direct reporting NFFE that, immediately before the NFFE agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity, was a direct reporting NFFE or sponsored direct reporting NFFE of another sponsoring entity. The sponsoring entity may certify for a sponsored direct reporting NFFE described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the sponsoring entity before the date that the NFFE first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity if the sponsoring entity obtains from the NFFE (or the NFFE's sponsoring entity, if applicable) a written certification that the NFFE has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: The sponsoring entity does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the sponsored direct reporting NFFE for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period during which such NFFE was sponsored by the sponsoring entity.
