###### § 1.642(c)-6 Valuation of a remainder interest in property transferred to a pooled income fund.
####### Transitional rules for valuation of transfers to pooled income funds.

(2)(i) For purposes of sections 2055, 2106, or 2624, if on May 1, 2009, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the disposition of the property could not be changed, and the decedent died on or after May 1, 2009, without having regained competency to dispose of the decedent's property, or the decedent died within 90 days of the date that the decedent first regained competency on or after May 1, 2009, the present value of a remainder interest is determined as if the valuation date with respect to the decedent's gross estate is either before or after May 1, 2009, at the option of the decedent's executor.

(ii) For purposes of sections 170, 2055, 2106, 2522, or 2624, in the case of transfers to a pooled income fund for which the valuation date is on or after May 1, 2009, and before July 1, 2009, the present value of the remainder interest under this section is determined by use of the appropriate yearly rate of return for the month in which the valuation date occurs (see §§ 1.7520-1(b) and 1.7520-2(a)(2)) and the appropriate actuarial tables under either paragraph (e)(6) of this section or § 1.642(c)-6A(f)(6), at the option of the donor or the decedent's executor, as the case may be.

(iii) For purposes of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, where the donor or decedent's executor is given the option to use the appropriate actuarial tables under either paragraph (e)(6) of this section or § 1.642(c)-6A(f)(6), the donor or decedent's executor must use the same actuarial table with respect to each individual transaction and with respect to all transfers occurring on the valuation date (for example, gift and income tax charitable deductions with respect to the same transfer must be determined based on the same tables, and all assets includible in the gross estate and/or estate tax deductions claimed must be valued based on the same tables).
