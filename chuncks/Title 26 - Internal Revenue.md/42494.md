###### ยง 1.986(a)-1 Translation of foreign income taxes for purposes of the foreign tax credit.
####### Election to translate foreign income taxes using the spot rate as of date of payment,Eligibility to make election.

(iv)-(A)An individual or corporate taxpayer (including a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation) that is otherwise required to translate foreign income taxes that are denominated in foreign currency using the average exchange rate may elect to translate foreign income taxes described in this paragraph (a)(2)(iv) into dollars using the spot rate on the date of payment of the foreign income taxes, provided that the liability for such taxes is denominated in nonfunctional currency. For purposes of section 986(a)(1)(D) and this paragraph (a)(2)(iv), whether the currency in which a tax liability attributable to a qualified business unit (within the meaning of section 989(a)) (QBU) is denominated is a nonfunctional currency is determined by reference to the functional currency of the individual or corporate taxpayer and not that of the QBU of the taxpayer. Accrued but unpaid foreign income taxes subject to the election under this paragraph (a)(2)(iv) are translated at the provisional year-end rate. However, a taxpayer that claims a foreign tax credit under section 901 may choose to translate accrued but unpaid foreign income taxes (including foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960 with respect to a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation that has made an election under this paragraph (a)(2)(iv)) into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment, in lieu of the provisional year-end rate, if such taxes are paid prior to the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed and such return is timely filed. In all other cases, see ยง 1.905-3 and paragraph (c) of this section for required adjustments upon payment of accrued foreign income taxes that are translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment.
