####### ยง 48.4061-1 Temporary regulations with respect to floor stock refunds or credits on cement mixers.
######## Held by a dealer.

(3)A cement mixer shall be considered as "held by a dealer" if title thereto has passed to the dealer (whether or not delivery to him has been made), and if for purposes of consumption title to the cement mixer or possession thereof had not at any time prior to January 1, 1970, been transferred to any person other than a dealer. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section and notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a cement mixer shall be considered as "held by a dealer" and not to have been used, although possession of such cement mixer has been transferred to another person, if such cement mixer is returned to the dealer in a transaction under which any amount paid or deposited by the transferee for such cement mixer is refunded to him (other than amounts retained by the dealer to cover damage to the cement mixer). Moreover, such a cement mixer shall be considered as held by a dealer on January 1, 1970, even though it was in the possession of the transferee on such day, if it was returned to the dealer (in a transaction described in the preceding sentence) before January 31, 1970. The determination as to the time title passes or possession is obtained for purposes of consumption shall be made under applicable local law. (See subdivisions (iii), (iv), and (v) of paragraph (b)(4) of ยง 145.2-1 of this subchapter for examples illustrating the provisions of this subparagraph.)
