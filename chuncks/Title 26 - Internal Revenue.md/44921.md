####### Corporations sustaining foreign expropriation capital losses for taxable years ending after December 31, 1958,In general.

(2)-(i)A corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1958, any portion of which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, shall carry over such portion of the loss to each of the ten succeeding taxable years and treat it in each of such succeeding taxable years as a short-term capital loss to the extent and consistent with the manner provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For such purposes, the portion of any net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is the amount, not in excess of the net capital loss for such year, of the foreign expropriation capital loss for such year. The portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss shall be treated as a separate net capital loss for that year and shall be applied, after first applying the remaining portion of such net capital loss, to offset any capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in a succeeding taxable year. In applying net capital losses of two or more taxable years to offset the capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of a subsequent taxable year, such net capital losses shall be offset against such capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in the order of the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest preceding taxable year, even though one or more of such net capital losses are attributable in whole or in part to a foreign expropriation capital loss.
