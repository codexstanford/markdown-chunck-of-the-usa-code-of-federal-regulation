####### iii,Application of test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.,2,i,Example 3,2,ii,Example 3

()For purposes of applying the test described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the price paid by persons located within the United States for the service provided by the related party (FC) is $10x, as determined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)()() of this section (the analysis of this). The amount of the price that is attributable to DC's service is $7.5x, as determined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)()() of this section (the analysis of this). Accordingly, of the price treated as paid to FC by persons located within the United States, 75 percent ($7.5x/$10x) is attributable to the related party service. Because more than 60 percent of the price treated as paid by persons within the United States for FC's service is attributable to DC's service, the service provided by DC to FC is substantially similar to the design service provided by FC to persons located within the United States under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
