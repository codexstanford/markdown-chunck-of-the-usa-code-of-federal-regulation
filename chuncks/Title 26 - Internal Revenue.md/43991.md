####### Deferred development and exploration expenses.,tax-benefit amount allowed

(f)Expenditures for development and exploration of mines or mineral deposits treated as deferred expenses under sections 615 and 616, or under the corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws, are chargeable to capital account and shall be an adjustment to the basis of the property to which they relate. The basis so adjusted shall be reduced by the amount of such expenditures allowed as deductions which results in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A (other than chapter 2 relating to tax on self-employment income) of the Code, or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws, but not less than the amounts allowable under such provisions for the taxable year and prior years. This amount is considered as theand shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of ยง 1.1016-3. For example, if a taxpayer purchases unexplored and undeveloped mining property for $1,000,000 and at the close of the development stage has incurred exploration and development costs of $9,000,000 treated as deferred expenses, the basis of such property at such time for computing gain or loss will be $10,000,000. Assuming that the taxpayer in this example has operated the mine for several years and has deducted allowable percentage depletion in the amount of $2,000,000 and has deducted allowable deferred exploration and development expenditures of $2,000,000, the basis of the property in the taxpayer's hands for purposes of determining gain or loss from a sale will be $6,000,000.
