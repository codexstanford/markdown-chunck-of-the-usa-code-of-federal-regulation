(4)A taxpayer who has filed his return with one of the jurisdictions named in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for a prior taxable year and is required to file his return for a later taxable year with the other such jurisdiction may not, for such later taxable year, change his accounting period, method of accounting, or any election to which he is bound with respect to his reporting of taxable income to the first jurisdiction unless he obtains the consent of the second jurisdiction to make such change. However, such change will not be effective for returns filed thereafter with the first jurisdiction unless before such later date of filing he also obtains the consent of the first jurisdiction to make such change. Any request for consent to make a change pursuant to this subparagraph must be made to the office where the return is required to be filed under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph and in sufficient time to permit a copy of the consent to be attached to the return for the taxable year.
