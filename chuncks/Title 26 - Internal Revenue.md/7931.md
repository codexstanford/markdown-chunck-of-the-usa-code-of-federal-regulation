()A principal purpose of A entering into the transactions was to reduce the amount incurred by A that otherwise would be interest expense; in effect, A sought to convert a substantial portion of its interest expense deductions on Loan 1 into section 162 deductions on the Guarantee Fee Agreement ($100x interest expense had A borrowed without the Guarantee compared to $60x interest expense related to Loan 1 and $40x section 162 deduction). A would not have entered into the Guarantee Fee Agreement in the ordinary course of A's trade or business. The $40x section 162 deductions related to the Guarantee Fee Agreement were incurred by A in a series of transactions in which A secured the use of funds for a period of time and were substantially incurred in consideration of the time value of money. As a result, under paragraph (b)(22)(iv)(A)() of this section, for purposes of section 163(j), the $40x paid by A to FC on the Guarantee Fee Agreement is treated by A as interest expense.
