###### ยง 1.381(c)(6)-1 Depreciation method.
####### Agreement under section 167(d).

(d)To the extent not inconsistent with paragraph (b) of this section, an acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation in the case of an agreement between the distributor or transferor corporation and the district director under section 167(d) and ยง 1.167(d)-1 with respect to property to which section 381(c)(6) and this section apply. Thus, in the case where the basis of an asset in the hands of an acquiring corporation exceeds the basis of such asset in the hands of the distributor or the transferor corporation, such an agreement will not have the effect of permitting the acquiring corporation to compute its depreciation allowance with respect to such excess basis under the methods provided in section 167(b)(2), (3), or (4). However, the provisions of the agreement will continue to apply with respect to the useful life of the asset.
