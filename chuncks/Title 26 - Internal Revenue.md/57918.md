## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### ADDITIONS TO THE TAX, ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AND ASSESSABLE PENALTIES
###### ยง 1.6654-2 Exceptions to imposition of the addition to the tax in the case of individuals.
####### Beneficiaries of estates and trusts.

(3)In determining the applicability of the exceptions described in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section as of any installment date, the beneficiary of an estate or trust must take into account his distributable share of income from the estate or trust for the applicable period (whether or not actually distributed) if the trust or estate is required to distribute income to him currently. If the estate or trust is not required to distribute income currently, only the amounts actually distributed to the beneficiary during such period must be taken into account. If the taxable year of the beneficiary and the taxable year of the estate or trust are different, there shall be taken into account the beneficiary's distributable share of income, or the amount actually distributed to him as the case may be, during the months in the taxable year of the estate or trust ending within the taxable year of the beneficiary which precede the month in which the installment date falls. See subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for examples of a similar rule which is applied when a partner and the partnership of which he is a member have different taxable years.
