(ii) An educational organization which normally maintains and has a regular faculty, curriculum, and student body and meets the conditions of subdivision (i)() of this subparagraph, which relieves it from the requirement of filing annual returns, shall not be considered as having thereafter failed to continue meeting such conditions if it is temporarily compelled to curtail or discontinue its normal and regular activities during the existence of abnormal circumstances and conditions.

(iii) An organization organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals is "primarily supported by contributions of the general public" for any accounting period if more than 50 percent of its income and receipts for such period is actually derived from voluntary contributions and gifts made by the general public, as distinguished from a few contributors or donors or from related or associated persons. For purposes of this subdivision, the words "related or associated persons" refer to persons of a particular group who are connected with or are interested in the activities of the organization, such as founders, incorporators, shareholders, members, fiduciaries, officers, employees, or the like, or who are connected with such persons by family or business relationships. An organization claiming an exception from the filing of an information return under this subdivision must maintain adequate records in order to substantiate such claim. Furthermore, if it is doubtful to an organization that it falls within this exception for filing annual information returns, it must file the return on Form 990-A or Form 990-A (SF).
