###### ยง 1.1061-5 Section 1061(d) transfers to related persons.
####### Example 3: Transfer of an API to a Section 1061(d) Related Person.

(3)A holds an API in GP, a partnership which A has owned for four years. A transfers the API to a Section 1061(d) Related Person described in paragraph (e) of this section in exchange for $100 of cash, resulting in A recognizing long-term capital gain of $100. Because this is a transfer described in paragraph (b) of this section, section 1061(d) applies to the transfer of A's API and A must determine its Section 1061(d) Recharacterization Amount under paragraph (c) of this section. If, immediately prior to A's transfer of the API, the partnership had sold all of its assets in a fully taxable transaction for cash equal of the fair market value of the assets, A's share of the net long-term capital gain (excluding amounts not taken into account for purposes of section 1061 under ยง 1.1061-4(b)(7)) from assets held for three years or less would have been $120. Thus, A's Section 1061(d) Recharacterization Amount is $120. As a result, A's $100 long-term capital gain is re-characterized as short-term capital gain under paragraph (a) of this section. The API remains an API in the hands of the Section 1061(d) Related Person under ยง 1.1061-2(a)(1)(i).
