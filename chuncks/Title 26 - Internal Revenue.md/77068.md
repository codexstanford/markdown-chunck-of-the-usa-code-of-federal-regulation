Moreover, in determining such profits of the United States permanent establishment of such enterprise, there shall be allowed as deductions all expenses which are reasonably applicable to the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so applicable. See sections 861 through 864, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and the regulations thereunder.
