###### Participating emergency facility

means any emergency department of a hospital, or an independent freestanding emergency department (or a hospital, with respect to services that pursuant to ยง 54.9816-4T(c)(2)(ii) are included as emergency services), that has a contractual relationship directly or indirectly with a group health plan setting forth the terms and conditions on which a relevant item or service is provided to a participant or beneficiary under the plan. A single case agreement between an emergency facility and a plan that is used to address unique situations in which a participant or beneficiary requires services that typically occur out-of-network constitutes a contractual relationship for purposes of this definition, and is limited to the parties to the agreement.
