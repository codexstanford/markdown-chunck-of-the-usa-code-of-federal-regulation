() An entity may rely upon a certification pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) for a period of two calendar years following the close of the calendar year in which the certification was given. If an interest holder becomes a foreign person (or no longer is treated as a withholding qualified holder (as defined in ยง 1.1445-1(g)(11)) and therefore is no longer treated as a non-foreign person for purposes of withholding under section 1445 within the period described in the preceding sentence, the interest-holder must notify the entity before any further dispositions or distributions and upon receipt of such notice (or any other notification of the foreign status of the interest-holder) the entity may no longer rely upon the prior certification. An entity that obtains and relies upon a certification must retain that certification with its books and records for a period of three calendar years following the close of the last calendar year in which the entity relied upon the certification.
