(I)-()The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(5)(vi)(G)() of this section (the facts in), except that Country X does not have a Base Erosion Tax, and it allows resident corporations to elect to pay either the Income Tax or a separate levy using an alternative cost allowance (the "Alternative Tax"), which qualifies as a tax in lieu of an income tax under ยง 1.903-1(b)(2). CFC's liability under the Income Tax is 80u, and its liability under the Alternative Tax is 100u. CFC chooses to pay the 100u of Alternative Tax rather than the 80u of Income Tax.
