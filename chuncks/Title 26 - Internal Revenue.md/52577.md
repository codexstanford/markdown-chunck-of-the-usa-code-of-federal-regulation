####### Allocation of special status losses.,1,i

(D)The amount of the group's CNOL that is determined to constitute a farming loss (as defined in section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii)) or any other net operating loss that is subject to special carryback or carryover rules (special status loss) is allocated to each member separately from the remainder of the CNOL based on the percentage of the CNOL attributable to the member, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. This allocation is made without regard to whether a particular member actually incurred specific expenses or engaged in specific activities required by the special status loss provisions. This paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) applies only with regard to losses for which the special carryback or carryover rules are dependent on the type of expense generating the loss, rather than on the special status of the entity to which the loss is allocable. See section 172(b)(1)(C) and paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C)()() of this section (applicable to losses of nonlife insurance companies). This paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) does not apply to farming losses incurred by a consolidated group in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021.
