###### ยง 1.401(a)(4)-1 Nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4).
####### Application of section 410(b) rules,Relationship between sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b).

(4)-(i)To be a qualified plan, a plan must satisfy both sections 410(b) and 401(a)(4). Section 410(b) requires that a plan benefit a nondiscriminatory group of employees, and section 401(a)(4) requires that the contributions or benefits provided to employees benefiting under the plan not discriminate in favor of HCEs. Consistent with this requirement, the definition of a plan subject to testing under section 401(a)(4) is the same as the definition of a plan subject to testing under section 410(b), i.e., the plan determined after applying the mandatory disaggregation rules of ยง 1.410(b)-7(c) and the permissive aggregation rules of ยง 1.410(b)-7(d). In addition, whichever testing option is used for the plan year under ยง 1.410(b)-8(a) (e.g., quarterly testing) must also be used for purposes of determining whether the plan satisfies section 401(a)(4) for the plan year.
