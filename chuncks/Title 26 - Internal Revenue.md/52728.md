()As a result of the amended carryback rules enacted in Year 8, the P Group's $1,000 CNOL in Year 7 must be carried back to Year 2. Therefore, T's $600 attributed portion of the P Group's Year 7 CNOL (that is, T's amended carryback CNOL) must be carried back to taxable years of the X Group. See §§ 1.1502-21(b)(1) and 1.1502-21(b)(2)(i). To the extent T's amended carryback CNOL is not absorbed in the X Group's Year 2 taxable year, the remaining portion must be carried to the X Group's Year 3, Year 4, and Year 5 taxable years, as appropriate. See id. Any remaining portion of T's amended carryback CNOL is carried to consolidated return years of the P Group. See § 1.1502-21(b)(1).
