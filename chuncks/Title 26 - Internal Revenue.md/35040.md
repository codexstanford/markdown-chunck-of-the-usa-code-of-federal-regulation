####### Modified gross income method.,1,10,See also

(ii)A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation that apportions its interest expense on the basis of modified gross income must characterize stock of the controlled foreign corporation using the modified gross income method under § 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii) to assign the modified gross income of the controlled foreign corporation to the statutory groupings described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A)() through () and (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), the rules described in §§ 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii) and 1.861-9T(j)(2) apply to combine gross income in a statutory grouping that is earned by the controlled foreign corporation with gross income of lower-tier controlled foreign corporations that is in the same statutory grouping. For example, foreign source general category gross tested income (net of interest expense) earned by the controlled foreign corporation is combined with its pro rata share of the foreign source general category gross tested income (net of interest expense) of lower-tier controlled foreign corporations. If the controlled foreign corporation owns stock in a lower-tier noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation, gross income of the lower-tier noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation is assigned to a gross subpart F income grouping to the extent that the income, if distributed to the upper-tier controlled foreign corporation, would be gross subpart F income of the upper-tier controlled foreign corporation.§ 1.861-12(c)(4).
