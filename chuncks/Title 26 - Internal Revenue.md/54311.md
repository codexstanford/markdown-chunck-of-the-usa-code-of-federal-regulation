(21)-(i)S owns DE1which, in turn, owns FB. S's interest in DE1and its indirect interest in FBare combined and treated as a single separate unit (Country X separate unit) pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-1(b)(4)(ii). In year 1, a dual consolidated loss is attributable to the Country X separate unit, and P does not make a domestic use election with respect to such loss. Under ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b), the year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to the Country X separate unit may not be used to offset the income of P or S (other than income attributable to the Country X separate unit, subject to the application of ยง 1.1503(d)-4(c)) on the group's consolidated U.S. income tax return (nor may it be used to offset the income of any other domestic affiliates). At the beginning of year 2, S transfers its entire interest in DE1, and thus its entire indirect interest in FB, to FSin a transaction described in section 381.
