####### Associated modification.,associated modification

(5)Anis a modification of the technical, administrative, or operational terms of a contract that is reasonably necessary to adopt or to implement the modifications described in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section other than associated modifications. An associated modification also includes an incidental cash payment intended to compensate a counterparty for small valuation differences resulting from a modification of the administrative terms of a contract, such as the valuation differences resulting from a change in observation period. Examples of associated modifications include a change to the definition of interest period or a change to the timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest (for example, delaying payment dates on a debt instrument by two days to allow sufficient time to compute and pay interest at a qualified rate computed in arrears).
