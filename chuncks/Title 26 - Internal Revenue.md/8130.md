####### 4,4,1,i,1,3

() If this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)() applies (see paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)()() of this section), and if the group has any section 163(j) limitation remaining for the current year after applying the rules in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)() of this section, then disallowed business interest expense carryforwards permitted to be deducted (including under paragraph (d)(1)(A) of this section) in the current year are to be deducted in the order of the taxable years in which they arose, beginning with the earliest taxable year. Disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from taxable years ending on the same date that are available to offset tentative taxable income for the current year generally are to be deducted on a pro rata basis under the principles of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)() of this section. For example, assume that P and S are the only members of a consolidated group with a section 163(j) limitation for the current year (Year 2) of $200x; the amount of current-year business interest expense deducted in Year 2 is $100x; and P and S, respectively, have $140x and $60x of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from Year 1 that are not subject to limitation under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section. Under these facts, P would be allowed to deduct $70x of its carryforwards from Year 1 ($100x x ($140x/($60x + $140x)) = $70x), and S would be allowed to deduct $30x of its carryforwards from Year 1 ($100x x ($60x/($60x + $140x)) = $30x). But see ยง 1.383-1(d)(1)(ii), providing that, if losses subject to and not subject to the section 382 limitation are carried from the same taxable year, losses subject to the limitation are deducted before losses not subject to the limitation.
