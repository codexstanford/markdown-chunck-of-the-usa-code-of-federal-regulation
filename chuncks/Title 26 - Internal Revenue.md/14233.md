###### ยง 1.263A-3 Rules relating to property acquired for resale.
####### Capitalization rules for property acquired for resale,In general.

(a)-(1)Section 263A applies to real property and personal property described in section 1221(1) acquired for resale by a retailer, wholesaler, or other taxpayer (reseller). However, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a small business taxpayer, as defined in ยง 1.263A-1(j), is not required to apply section 263A in that taxable year. For this purpose, personal property includes both tangible and intangible property. Property acquired for resale includes stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property which is includible in the taxpayer's inventory if on hand at the close of the taxable year, and property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business. See, however, ยง 1.263A-1(b)(11) for an exception for certain de minimis property provided to customers incident to the provision of services.
