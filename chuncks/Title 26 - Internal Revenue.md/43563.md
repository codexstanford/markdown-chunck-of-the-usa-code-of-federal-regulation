###### ยง 1.995-4 Gain on disposition of stock in a DISC.
####### Period during which a shareholder has held stock.

(2)For purposes of this section, the period during which a shareholder has held stock includes the period he is considered to have held it by reason of the application of section 1223 and, if his basis is determined in whole or in part under the provisions of section 1014(d) (relating to special rule for DISC stock acquired from decedent) or section 1022 (relating to property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010), the holding period of the decedent. Such holding period is to exclude the day of acquisition but include the day of disposition. Thus, for example, if A purchases stock in a DISC on December 31, 1972, and makes a gift of such stock to B on June 30, 1973, then on December 31, 1974, B will be treated as having held the stock for 2 full years. If the basis of the stock in C's hands is determined under section 1014(d) upon a transfer from B's estate on December 31, 1976, by reason of B's death on June 30, 1974, then on December 31, 1976, C will be treated as having held the stock for 4 full years.
