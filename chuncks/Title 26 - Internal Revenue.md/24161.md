###### ยง 1.444-1T Election to use a taxable year other than the required taxable year (temporary).
####### Deferral period of the taxable year that is being changed.

(iii)For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the phrase "deferral period of the taxable year that is being changed" means the deferral period of the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to make a section 444 election. Furthermore, the deferral period of such year will be determined by using the required taxable year of the taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to make a section 444 election. For example, assume P, a partnership that has historically used a March 31 taxable year, desires to change to a September 30 taxable year by making a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning April 1, 1987. Furthermore, assume that pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, P's required taxable year for the taxable year beginning April 1, 1987 is a year ending December 31. Based on these facts the deferral period of the taxable year being changed is nine months (the period from March 31 to December 31).
