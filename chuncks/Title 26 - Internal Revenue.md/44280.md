(3)The termof the real property includes, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, only that indebtedness on which the purchaser is liable to the seller and which arises out of the sale of such property. Thus, the term does not include any indebtedness in respect of the property that the seller owes to a third person which the purchaser assumes, or to which the property is subject, at the time of the sale of the property to the purchaser. Nor does the term include any indebtedness on which the purchaser is liable to the seller if such indebtedness arises subsequent to the sale of such property.
