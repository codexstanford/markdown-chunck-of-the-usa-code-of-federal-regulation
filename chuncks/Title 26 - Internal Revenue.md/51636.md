####### Termination of sponsoring entity.

(ii)If the IRS terminates the status of the sponsoring entity, the sponsoring entity must send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each sponsored FFI for which it acts, as well as to each withholding agent from which each sponsored FFI receives payments and each financial institution with which each sponsored FFI holds an account for which a withholding certificate or other documentation was provided. A sponsoring entity that has had its status terminated cannot register on the FATCA registration website to act as a sponsoring entity for any sponsored FFI or for any entity that is a sponsored entity under a Model 1 IGA unless it receives written approval from the IRS to register. Unless the status of a sponsored FFI has been terminated, the sponsored FFI may register on the FATCA registration website as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (as applicable). However, a sponsored FFI whose sponsoring entity has been terminated may not register or represent its status as a sponsored FFI of a sponsoring entity that has a relationship described in section 267(b) or 707(b) with the sponsoring entity that was terminated without receiving written approval from the IRS.
