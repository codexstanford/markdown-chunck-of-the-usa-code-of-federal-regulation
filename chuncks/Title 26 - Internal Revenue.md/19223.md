(viii)-(A)On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to USS2 in exchange for USS2 Note. In a transaction that is treated as independent from the transaction on Date A in Year 1, on Date B in Year 2, USS2 transfers a portion of its assets to DS2, a newly formed domestic corporation, in exchange for all of the stock of DS2 and DS2 Note. Immediately afterwards, USS2 distributes all of the DS2 stock and the DS2 Note to FP with respect to FP's USS2 stock in a transaction that qualifies under section 355. USS2's transfer of a portion of its assets to DS2 qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D). The DS2 stock has a value of $150x and DS2 Note has a value of $50x. The DS2 stock is not non-qualified preferred stock as defined in section 351(g)(2). Absent the application of this section, DS2 Note would be treated by FP as other property within the meaning of section 356.
