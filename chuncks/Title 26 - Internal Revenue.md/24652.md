(iv)-(A)In 2021, E, a manufacturer, enters into a contract with Fire Department for the manufacture and delivery of a fire truck. The fire truck takes 10 months to manufacture at an estimated cost of $60,000. The contract provides E with an enforceable right to recover costs incurred in manufacturing the fire truck regardless of whether the Fire Department accepts delivery of the fire truck or terminates the contract, and an enforceable right to an additional $20,000 if the fire truck is accepted by the Fire Department. E does not have an enforceable right to recover any portion of the additional $20,000 if the Fire Department were to terminate the contract before it accepts the fire truck. E has an obligation to cure any defects if the customer rejects the fire truck. In August 2021, E begins manufacturing the fire truck ordered by Fire Department and incurs $30,000 of costs for materials and labor for the contract. For its AFS, E reports $40,000 of AFS revenue for 2021 ($30,000 costs plus $10,000 expected profit on the sale of the fire truck).
