####### Example 3.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, with the following additions for 2022. The nonlife subgroup has nonlife consolidated taxable income of $50 (all of which is attributable to I) before the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Consolidated LICTI is $100. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, $50 of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss carryover ($165) is used in 2022 and, under paragraph (f)(3)(vi) and (vii) of this section, the portion used in 2022 is attributable to I, the ineligible nonlife member. Accordingly, the offsettable nonlife consolidated net operating loss from 2021 under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section is $65, the unused loss from 2021. The offsettable nonlife consolidated net operating loss in 2022 is $22.75 (35 percent of the lesser of the offsettable loss of $65 or consolidated LICTI of $100). Accordingly, under paragraph (e) of this section, consolidated taxable income is $77.25 (consolidated LICTI of $100 minus the offsettable loss of $22.75).
