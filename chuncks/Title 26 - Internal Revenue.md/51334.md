####### Requesting waiver or closure of a U.S. account,In general.

(2)-(i)If a participating FFI (or branch thereof) is prohibited by law from reporting the information required under paragraph (d) of this section with respect to a U.S. account that it maintains unless a valid and effective waiver of such law is obtained, the participating FFI must request a valid and effective waiver (including by obtaining waivers from all relevant account holders if necessary). For accounts other than preexisting accounts, the participating FFI must obtain a valid and effective waiver upon opening the account or, if prohibitions on disclosure cannot by law be waived, the participating FFI must refrain from opening accounts that are U.S. accounts or must transfer such accounts as described in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section. Beginning on the date provided in ยง 1.1471-5(g)(3) and until such time as the holder of a U.S. account either consents to disclosure or closure of the account or until the account is transferred, the participating FFI is required to treat the account as held by a recalcitrant account holder.
