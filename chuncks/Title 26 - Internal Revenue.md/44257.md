####### Application of section 1232 upon disposition or redemption of new obligation,Exchanges involving nonrecognition of gain on obligations issued at a discount.

(b)-(1)If an obligation, the gain on which is subject to the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), because the obligation was originally issued at a discount, is surrendered to the United States in exchange for another obligation and any part of the gain realized on the exchange is not then recognized because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or because of so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)), the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) shall apply to so much of such unrecognized gain as is later recognized upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the exchange as though the obligation so disposed of or redeemed were the obligation surrendered, rather than the obligation received, in such exchange. See the first sentence of section 1037(b)(1). Thus, in effect that portion of the gain which is unrecognized on the exchange but is recognized upon the later disposition or redemption of the obligation received from the United States in the exchange shall be considered as ordinary income in an amount which is equal to the gain which, by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) upon the earlier surrender of the old obligation to the United States, would have been considered as ordinary income if the gain had been recognized upon such earlier exchange. Any portion of the gain which is recognized under section 1031(b) upon the earlier exchange and is treated at such time as ordinary income shall be deducted from the gain which is treated as ordinary income by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) pursuant to this subparagraph upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the earlier exchange. This subparagraph shall apply only in a case where on the exchange of United States obligations there was some gain not recognized by reason of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)); it shall not apply where, only loss was unrecognized by reason of section 1037(a).
