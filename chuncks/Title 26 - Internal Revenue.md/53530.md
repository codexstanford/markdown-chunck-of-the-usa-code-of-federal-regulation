###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Sale outside of the consolidated group followed by a reacquisition beyond the lookback period.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except that B acquires Equipment #2 and places it in service in 2024 instead of 2019. B's acquisition of Equipment #2 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. B would not be treated as previously having a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 under the Group Prior Use Rule because the Parent group did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #2 within the lookback period. Assuming all other requirements in ยง 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #2 in 2024. The result would be the same if S, rather than B, acquired and placed in service Equipment #2 in 2024.
