###### ยง 1.1502-33 Earnings and profits.
####### Prior period group structure changes.

(ii)If there was a group structure change in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, and earnings and profits were not determined under ยง 1.1502-33T(a) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994, a distribution in a tax year ending after September 7, 1988, of earnings and profits that are not reflected in the earnings and profits of the distributee member, but would have been so reflected if ยง 1.1502-33T(a) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 had applied, the negative adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for distributions does not apply (and there is therefore no offset to the increase in the earnings and profits of the distributee).
