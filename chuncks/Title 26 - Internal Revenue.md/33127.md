####### Rules for gas producers that produce natural gas under joint operating agreements,Joint operating agreements and gas balancing.

(d)-(1)Co-owners of a property producing natural gas enter into a joint operating agreement (JOA) to define the rights and obligations of each co- producer of the gas in place. The JOA determines, among other things, each co-producer's proportionate share of the natural gas as it is produced from the reservoir, together with the associated production expenses. A gas imbalance arises when a co-producer does not take its proportionate share of current gas production under the JOA (underproducer) and another co-producer takes more than its proportionate share of current production (overproducer). The co-producers often enter into a gas balancing agreement (GBA) as an addendum to their JOA to establish their rights and obligations when a gas imbalance arises. A GBA typically allows the overproducer to take the amount of the gas imbalance (overproduced gas) and entitles the underproducer to recoup the overproduced gas either from the volume of the gas remaining in the reservoir or by a cash balancing payment.
