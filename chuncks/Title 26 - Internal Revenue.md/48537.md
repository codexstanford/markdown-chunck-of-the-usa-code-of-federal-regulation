####### Facts.

(i)Taxpayer A realizes $1 million of eligible gain and on the next day contributes $1 million to a QOF, Partnership P, in exchange for a 50 percent interest in Partnership P. Taxpayer A makes an election under section 1400Z-2(a) with respect to $900,000 of that eligible gain. Under section 1400Z-2(e)(1), 90 percent of A's investment is described in section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(i) (an investment that only includes amounts to which the election under section 1400Z-2(a) applies), and 10 percent is described in section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(ii) (a separate investment consisting of other amounts). Partnership P borrows $8 million. Under ยง 1.752-3(a), taking into account the terms of the partnership agreement, $4 million of the $8 million liability is allocated to A.
