###### ยง 1.1502-95 Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup).
####### Effect on corporations to which the allocation is made.

(4)For purposes of determining the amount of the former member's recognized built-in losses in any taxable year beginning after the former member ceases to be a member-

(i) The amount of the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in loss that is allocated to the former member is treated as if it were an amount of net unrealized built-in loss determined under section 382(h)(1)(B)(i)(without regard to the threshold of section 382(h)(3)(B)) with respect to such member or loss subgroup, and that amount is not reduced under section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) by the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) recognized built-in losses;

(ii) The former member's 5 year recognition period begins on the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) change date;

(iii) In applying section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii), the former member takes into account only its prior taxable years that begin after it ceases to be a member of the loss group (or loss subgroup); and

(iv) The former member's recognized built-in loss on the disposition of an asset is determined under section 382(h)(2)(B), treating references to the change date in that section as references to the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) change date.
