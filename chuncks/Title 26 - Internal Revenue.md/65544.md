(c)-(1)Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person is allowed to use the Monthly rule of ยง 31.6302-1(c)(1) for an entire calendar year unless the amount of R.R.T.A. taxes required to be deposited under this section during the lookback period was more than $50,000. The lookback period is defined as the calendar year preceding the calendar year just ended.

New employers shall be treated as having employment tax liabilities of zero for any calendar year during which the employer did not exist.
