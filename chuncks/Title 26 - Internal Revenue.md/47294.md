####### Deposits into Merchant Marine Capital Construction Fund,Reductions to taxable income and electible farm income.

(4)-(i)Under section 7518(c)(1)(A), certain deposits to a Merchant Marine Capital Construction Fund (CCF) reduce taxable income for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (the CCF reduction). The amount of the CCF reduction is limited under section 7518(a)(1)(A) to the taxpayer's taxable income (determined without regard to the reduction) attributable to specified maritime operations including operations in fisheries of the United States. The CCF reduction is taken into account in determining the taxable income used in computations under this section. In addition, except to the extent the amount described in section 7518(a)(1)(A) is not attributable to the individual's fishing business, the CCF reduction is treated in computing electible farm income as an item of deduction attributable to the individual's fishing business.
