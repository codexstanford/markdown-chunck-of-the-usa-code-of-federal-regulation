###### ยง 1.401(a)(35)-1 Diversification requirements for certain defined contribution plans.
####### Indirect restrictions or conditions

(ii)-(A) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a plan violates the requirements of this paragraph (e) if the plan imposes a restriction or condition described in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section either directly or indirectly.

(B) A plan imposes an indirect restriction on an individual's right to divest an investment in employer securities if, for example, the plan provides that a participant who divests his or her account balance with respect to the investment in employer securities is not permitted for a period of time thereafter to reinvest in employer securities.

(C) A plan does not impose an indirect restriction or condition merely because there are tax consequences that result from an individual's divestment of an investment in employer securities. Thus, the loss of the special treatment for net unrealized appreciation provided under section 402(e)(4) with respect to employer securities is disregarded. Similarly, a plan does not impose an impermissible restriction or condition merely because it provides that an individual may not reinvest divested amounts in the same employer securities account but is permitted to invest such divested amounts in another employer securities account where the only relevant difference between the separate accounts is the section 402(e)(4) cost (or other basis) of the trust in the shares held in each account. (See ยง 1.402(a)-1(b) for rules regarding section 402(e)(4).)
