####### Introduction,In general.

(a)-(1)This section provides guidance with respect to the application of section 263A to property produced in a farming business as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Except as otherwise provided by the rules of this section, the general rules of §§ 1.263A-1 through 1.263A-3 and §§ 1.263A-7 through 1.263A-15 apply to property produced in a farming business. A taxpayer that engages in the raising or growing of any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including both plants and animals, is engaged in the production of property. Section 263A generally requires the capitalization of the direct costs and an allocable portion of the indirect costs that directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the production of this property. The direct and indirect costs of producing plants or animals generally include preparatory costs allocable to the plant or animal and preproductive period costs of the plant or animal. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (e) of this section, taxpayers must capitalize the costs of producing all plants and animals unless the election described in paragraph (d) of this section is made.
