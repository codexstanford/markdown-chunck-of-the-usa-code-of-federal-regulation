###### Backup withholding certification.

(4)Once a payee receives a final notice from the Internal Revenue Service notifying him that his reportable interest or dividend payments are subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payee shall not certify to any payor or broker, under penalties of perjury, that he is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). See paragraph (k)(2) of this section for the penalties that will apply to a payee who makes a false certification. The payee may not make the certification until the payee receives the certification provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section from the Internal Revenue Service advising the payee that he is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) (as provided in A-33 of ยง 35a.9999-1). See A-37 of ยง 35a.9999-1 for the rule applicable to a payor who makes reportable interest or dividend payments to a payee who fails to certify that he is not subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting.
