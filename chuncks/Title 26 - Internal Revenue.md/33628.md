####### Unearned premiums,In general.

(8)-(i)The unearned premium for a contract, other than a contract described in section 816(b)(1)(B), generally is the portion of the gross premium written that is attributable to future insurance coverage during the effective period of the insurance contract. However, unearned premiums held by an insurance company with regard to the net value of risks reinsured with other solvent companies (whether or not authorized to conduct business under state law) are subtracted from the company's unearned premiums. Unearned premiums also do not include any additional liability established by the insurance company on its annual statement to cover premium deficiencies. Unearned premiums do not include an insurance company's estimate of its liability for amounts to be paid or credited to a customer with regard to the expired portion of a retrospectively rated contract (retro credits). An insurance company's estimate of additional amounts payable by its customers with regard to the expired portion of a retrospectively rated contract (retro debits) cannot be subtracted from unearned premiums.
