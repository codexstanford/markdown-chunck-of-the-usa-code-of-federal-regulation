####### Treatment of policyholder loans.

(8)For purposes of determining the net consideration under a reinsurance agreement, the transfer of a policyholder loan receivable is treated as an item of consideration under the agreement. The interest credited with respect to a policyholder loan receivable is treated as investment income earned directly by the party holding the receivable. The amounts taken into account as claims and benefit reimbursements under the agreement must be determined without reduction for the policyholder loan.
