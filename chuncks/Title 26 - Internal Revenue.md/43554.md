###### ยง 1.995-3 Distributions upon disqualification.
####### Effect of actual distributions and deemed distributions under section 995(b)(1)(G).

(e)If, during the period a shareholder of a DISC, or former DISC, is taking into account deemed distributions under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an actual distribution is made to him out of accumulated DISC income or a deemed distribution because of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans is made under ยง 1.995-2(a)(5) out of accumulated DISC income, such actual or deemed distribution shall first reduce the last installment of the deemed distributions scheduled to be included in the shareholder's gross income as a dividend, and then the preceding scheduled installments in reverse order. If deemed distributions are scheduled to be included in gross income for two or more disqualifications, an actual distribution or a deemed distribution under ยง 1.995-2 (a)(5) which is treated as made out of accumulated DISC income reduces the deemed distributions resulting from the earlier disqualification first.
