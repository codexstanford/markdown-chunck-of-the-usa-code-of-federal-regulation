###### ยง 1.807-1 Computation of life insurance reserves.
####### Tax reserve method.

(a)For purposes of determining the amount of life insurance reserves for a contract under section 807(d)(1), section 807(d)(2) requires the determination of the amount of the reserve for a contract using the tax reserve method applicable to the contract. Under section 807(d)(3), the tax reserve method applicable to the contract is the Commissioners' Reserve Valuation Method (CRVM), the Commissioners' Annuities Reserve Valuation Method (CARVM), or other reserve method prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) that applies to the contract as of the date the reserve is determined. If the NAIC has not prescribed a reserve method that covers the contract, a reserve method that is consistent with the CRVM, the CARVM, or other NAIC-prescribed method as of the date the reserve is determined (whichever is most appropriate) must be used.
