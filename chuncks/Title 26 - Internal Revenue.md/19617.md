####### Q-36:

How do plans satisfy the requirements of providing participants explanations of QPSAs and QJSAs?

A-36. For rules regarding the explanation of QPSAs and QJSAs required under section 417(a)(3), see ยง 1.417(a)(3)-1. However, the rules of ยง 1.401(a)-20, Q&A-36, as it appeared in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2003, apply to the explanation of a QJSA under section 417(a)(3) for an annuity starting date prior to February 1, 2006.
