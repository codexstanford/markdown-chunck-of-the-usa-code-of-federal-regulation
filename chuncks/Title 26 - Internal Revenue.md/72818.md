######## Adjustments in partner proceeding.

(ii)In a proceeding with respect to a partner described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the IRS may adjust any identified, inconsistently reported partnership-related item to make the item consistent with the treatment of that item on the partnership return or determine that the correct treatment of such item differs from the treatment on the partnership return and instead adjust the item to reflect the correct treatment, notwithstanding the treatment of that item on the partnership return. The IRS may also adjust any item on the partner's return, including items that are not partnership-related items. Any final decision with respect to an inconsistent position in a proceeding to which the partnership is not a party is not binding on the partnership.
