###### ยง 1.383-1 Special limitations on certain capital losses and excess credits.
####### Example.

(ii)L, a new loss corporation, is a calendar-year taxpayer. L has an ownership change on December 31, 2021. For 2022, L has taxable income (prior to the use of any pre-change losses) of $100,000. In addition, L has a section 382 limitation of $25,000, a pre-change net operating loss carryover of $12,000, a pre-change general business credit carryforward under section 39 of $50,000, and no items described in ยง 1.383-1(d)(2)(i) through (iv). L's section 383 credit limitation for 2022 is the excess of its regular tax liability computed after allowing a $12,000 net operating loss deduction (taxable income of $88,000; regular tax liability of $18,480), over its regular tax liability computed after allowing an additional deduction in the amount of L's section 382 limitation remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, or $13,000 (taxable income of $75,000; regular tax liability of $15,750). L's section 383 credit limitation is therefore $2,730 ($18,480 minus $15,750).
