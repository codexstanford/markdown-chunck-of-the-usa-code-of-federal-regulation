#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Determination of Sources of Income
###### ยง 1.861-8 Computation of taxable income from sources within the United States and from other sources and activities.
####### ii,Analysis-allocation.

()Under section 818(f)(1), U.S.C.'s reserve deduction is treated as an item that cannot be definitely allocated to an item or class of gross income except that, under ยง 1.861-8(e)(16), an amount of reserve expenses of a life insurance company equal to the DRD that is disallowed because it is attributable to the policyholder's share of dividends is treated as definitely related to such dividends. Thus, U.S.C. has a life insurance reserve deduction of $130x, of which $30 (equal to the policyholder's share of the DRD that would have been allowed under section 243(a)(1)) is directly allocated and apportioned to U.S. source dividend income. Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the remaining portion of U.S.C.'s reserve deduction ($100x) is allocable to all of U.S.C.'s gross income as a class.
