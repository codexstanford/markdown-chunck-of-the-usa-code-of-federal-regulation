For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, such computation shall include the tax imposed by chapter 2 on the actual self-employment income for such months. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "actual self-employment income" means:

(i) The net earnings from self-employment (as defined in section 1402(a))for such calendar months, computed as if such months constituted the taxable year, but not more than

(C) For taxable years beginning after 1972, $10,800,

(D) For taxable years beginning after 1973, $13,200, and

(E) For taxable years beginning after 1974, an amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) which is effective for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, over the amount of wages (within the meaning of section 1402(b)) for such months.

(4) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before the date prescribed for payment if the estimated tax were an amount equal to a tax determined on the basis of the tax rates and the taxpayer's status with respect to personal exemptions under section 151 for the taxable year, but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the return for the preceding taxable year and the law applicable to such year, in the case of an individual required to file a return for such preceding taxable year.
