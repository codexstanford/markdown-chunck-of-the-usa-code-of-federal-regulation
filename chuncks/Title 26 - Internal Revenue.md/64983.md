###### ยง 31.3406(d)-5 Backup withholding when the Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold because the payee's taxpayer identification number is incorrect.
####### Manner required for payee to furnish certified taxpayer identification number.

(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, in order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting, or to stop it once it has begun, a payee with respect to whom the payor has been notified under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) that the payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect is required on Form W-9 (or an acceptable substitute form) to-

(i) Provide the payee's name and taxpayer identification number; and

(ii) Certify, under penalties of perjury, that the taxpayer identification number being provided is correct.

(2) The certification must be made even if the account is a pre-1984 account and even if the payment to the account is a reportable payment other than interest, dividends, patronage dividends, original issue discount, or proceeds of a sale of a security or commodity. In order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting or to stop it once it has begun, a payee is not required to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C). With respect to notices received under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section on or after September 1, 1993, the requirements of this paragraph (f) are not satisfied if a payee provides only an awaiting TIN certification. As a result, a payor must not fail to begin backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification, or stop it once it has begun solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification.
