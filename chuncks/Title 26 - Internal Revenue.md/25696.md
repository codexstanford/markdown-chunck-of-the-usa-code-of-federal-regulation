##### taxable year for which deductions taken
###### ยง 1.466-2 Special protective election for certain taxpayers.
####### Right to amend prior tax returns.

(d)This paragraph applies only to those taxpayers who have agreed in a prior year to discontinue the use of the method of accounting described in ยง 1.451-4 for discount coupon redemptions. If the taxpayer used such method of accounting on the original return filed for the prior taxable year, and if any such year is not closed under the statute of limitations or by reason of a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, a taxpayer who has made a protective election may file an amended return and a claim for refund for such years. In this amended return, the taxpayer should account for its discount coupon redemptions, according to the method of accounting described in ยง 1.451-4. This is not to be construed, however, to abrogate in any way the rules regarding the close of taxable years due to the statute of limitations or a binding closing agreement between the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer.
