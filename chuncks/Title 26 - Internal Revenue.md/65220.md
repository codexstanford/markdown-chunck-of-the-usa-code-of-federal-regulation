####### Example.

(iii)Employer X is required by State law to pay his employees within 6 days after the compensation is earned. In compliance with the State law, employer X, for services rendered to him for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, pays his employees on the last-named date. June 1955 is the last month of a period for which a return of tax is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Employer X may elect to include in the return required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the period April 1 to June 30, 1955, the compensation paid to his employees for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, inclusive, although the compensation for July 1 and 2 falls within another period for which a return is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If, in this example, the payroll week ended on July 5, 1955, the compensation paid for the payroll week of June 29 to July 5 would be included in the return period in which July falls although the compensation earned for June 29 and 30 fell in a prior return period under the general rule.
