###### § 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Effect of the non-QOF C corporation election.

(B)As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), the pre-existing QOF sub is treated from day one as a member of the consolidated group and not as a QOF. Therefore, section 1400Z-2 is not applicable, and amended returns or superseding returns must be filed, as applicable, to account for the eligible gain that was invested in the pre-existing QOF sub. In addition, appropriate adjustments must be made to account for the non-applicability of section 1400Z-2, including adjustments to members' stock basis and earnings and profits under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33, respectively.
