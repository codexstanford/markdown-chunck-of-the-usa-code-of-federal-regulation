####### Recapture.

(C)At the close of Year 2, Unit #6's unsuitability for occupancy precludes it from being described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Unit #6's resulting failure to be a low-income unit prevents it from being in a qualified group for purposes of computing the applicable fraction. The decline in the applicable fraction yields a decline in qualified basis, which results in credit recapture under section 42(j) for Year 2. Additionally, Unit #5 is not a low-income unit because the taxpayer did not include it in the qualified group of units identified for determining the building's applicable fraction. The exclusion of Unit #5 from the qualified group of units further reduces the applicable fraction for Year 2 and so reduces qualified basis for that year as well. Thus, this exclusion increases the credit recapture amount under section 42(j).
