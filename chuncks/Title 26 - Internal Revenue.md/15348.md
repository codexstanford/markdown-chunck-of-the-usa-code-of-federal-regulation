()Employer G provides food and beverages to its non-specified individual employees without charge at a company cafeteria on its premises. The food and beverages do not meet the definition of afringe under section 132(e). Thus, G treats the full fair market value of the food and beverage expenses as compensation and wages, and properly determines this amount under ยง 1.61-21. Under section 274(e)(2) and paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the expenses associated with the food and beverages provided to the employees are not subject to the 50 percent deduction limitation in paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, G may deduct 100 percent of the food and beverage expenses.
