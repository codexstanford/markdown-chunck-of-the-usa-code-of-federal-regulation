(2)R&E expenditures (as defined in ยง 1.861-17(a)) in the case of an affiliated group are allocated and apportioned under the rules of ยง 1.861-17 as if all members of the affiliated group were a single taxpayer. Thus, R&E expenditures are allocated to all gross intangible income of all members of the affiliated group reasonably connected with the relevant broad SIC code category.
