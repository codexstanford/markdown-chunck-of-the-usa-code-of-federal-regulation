###### § 1.358-7 Transfers by partners and partnerships to corporations.
####### Transfers by partnerships.,Example 1

(b)If a corporation assumes a section 358(h) liability from a partnership in an exchange to which section 358(a) applies, then, for purposes of applying section 705 (determination of basis of partner's interest) and § 1.704-1(b), any reduction, under section 358(h)(1), in the partnership's basis in corporate stock received in the transaction is treated as an expenditure of the partnership described in section 705(a)(2)(B). See paragraph (e)of this section. This expenditure must be allocated among the partners in accordance with section 704(b) and (c) and § 1.752-7(c). If a partner's share of the reduction, under section 358(h)(1), in the partnership's basis in corporate stock exceeds the partner's basis in the partnership interest, then the partner recognizes gain equal to the excess, which is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest. This paragraph does not apply to the extent that § 1.752-7(j)(4) applies to the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by the corporation.
