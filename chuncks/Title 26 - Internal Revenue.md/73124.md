###### In General
####### § 301.6226-1 Election for an alternative to the payment of the imputed underpayment.
######## Partnership.

(2)A partnership making a valid election under this section is not liable for the imputed underpayment to which the election applies (and no assessment of tax, levy, or proceeding in any court for the collection of such imputed underpayment may be made against such partnership). Any adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment described in § 301.6225-1(f) that are associated with an imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(g)) for which an election under this section is made are not taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) and instead each reviewed year partners' share of the adjustments determined in accordance with § 301.6226-2(f) must be included on the statement described in § 301.6226-2.
