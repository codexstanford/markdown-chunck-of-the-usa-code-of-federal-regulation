###### Effect of participant's death on an election or revocation of an election under paragraph (c) or (d)(3).

(f)A plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section merely because the plan contains a provision that any election made under paragraph (c) or (d)(3) of this section and any revocation of any such election does not become effective or ceases to be effective if the participant dies within a period, not in excess of 2 years, beginning on the date of such election or revocation. A plan containing a provision described in the preceding sentence shall not satisfy the requirements of this section unless it also provides that any such election and any revocation of any such election will be given effect in any case in which-

(1) The participant dies from accidental causes,

(2) A failure to give effect to the election or revocation would deprive the participant's survivor of a survivor annuity, and

(3) Such election or revocation is made before such accident occurred.
