(v)The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(5)(iv) of this section (the facts in), except that X owns 10% of the voting stock of CFC2 and Y owns only 80% of the voting stock of CFC2. Because CFC2 is not a related person to CFC1 within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), the dividend is subpart F income of CFC1 that is taxable to USP and X. In addition, because X is a United States shareholder of both CFC1 and CFC2, CFC2 and CFC1 are related look-through entities under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, the dividend income is general category income to CFC1 and the subpart F inclusion is general category income to USP and X.
