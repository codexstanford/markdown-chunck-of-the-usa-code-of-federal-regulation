####### Result.

(B)Under paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section, the rules of § 1.367(a)-8 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2006) apply to the year 2005 disposition of the TFD stock because UST filed the gain recognition agreement after July 20, 1998, but before March 7, 2007. Under § 1.367(a)-8(e) (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2006), as a result of the disposition of the TFD stock by TFC, UST must recognize the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement. Paragraph (r)(2)(i) of this section does not apply because the rule provided by paragraph (k)(3) of this section was included in § 1.367(a)-8(g)(2) (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2006). However, UST may request relief for reasonable cause under § 1.367(a)-8(c)(2) (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2006) to file a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the disposition of the TFD stock by TFC in 2005.
