####### Meaning of "designed primarily for use on the high seas."

(2)Section 4042(c)(1) requires a determination of the primacy of the design features rendering the vessel useful for service on the high seas, as opposed to the features which render the vessel useful for service on all less turbulent waters. Thus, whether a ship is "designed primarily for use on the high seas" must be determined from all the facts, including structural features and equipment. If the predominant use of a vessel is on the high seas, it shall be presumed to be "designed primarily for use on the high seas." If the predominant use of a vessel is on waters other than the high seas, it shall be presumed not to be "designed primarily for use on the high seas."
