####### Alternate facts. Distribution to nonresident alien individual.,Example 23

(D)The facts are the same as in paragraph (q)(2)(xxiii)(A) of this section (the facts in this), except that X is a nonresident alien individual. Paragraph (k)(14) of this section does not apply to the distribution because the conditions of paragraph (k)(14)(ii) and (iii) of this section cannot be satisfied. Therefore, the distribution is a triggering event, and UST will recognize gain under the gain recognition agreement as required under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (v) of this section. The result would be the same if X were a foreign corporation and, immediately after the distribution, no United States person owned at least 5% (determined as provided in paragraph (k)(14)(ii) of this section) of the total voting power and value of the outstanding stock of X.
