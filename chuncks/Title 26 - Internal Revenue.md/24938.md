(iv)-(A)B is a calendar-year accrual method taxpayer with an AFS. In 2020, B enters into a $100x contract to design, build, operate and maintain a toll road and receives an up-front payment of $100x. The contract meets the definition of a long-term contract under § 1.460-1(b)(1). B properly determines that the obligations to design and build the toll road are long-term contract activities under § 1.460-1(d)(1) and accounts for the gross income from these activities under section 460. In addition, B properly determines that the obligations to operate and maintain the toll road are non-long-term contract activities under § 1.460-1(d)(2) and that the gross income attributable to these activities is accounted for under section 451(b). B allocates $60x of the transaction price amount to the long-term contract activities and the remaining $40x to the non-long-term contract activity pursuant to § 1.451-3(d)(5). For AFS purposes, B allocates $55x of the transaction price amount to the performance obligations that are long-term contract activities and $45x to the non-long-term contract activities. B uses the deferral method of accounting.
