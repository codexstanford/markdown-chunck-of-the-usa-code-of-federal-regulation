####### Analysis.

(ii)D's election under this section was properly made and is effective for the 2021 taxable year and subsequent years. D's dairy farm business is an excepted trade or business because D made the election with D's timely filed Federal income tax return. D's orchard business is a non-excepted trade or business, because D did not make an election for the orchard business to be an excepted trade or business. The sale of some but not all or substantially all of the assets from D's dairy farm business does not affect D's election under this section.
