####### U.S. place of birth.

(iii)A withholding agent has reason to know that documentary evidence provided by a direct account holder to support an individual's foreign status is unreliable or incorrect if the withholding agent has, either on the documentary evidence or as part of its account information, an unambiguous indication of a place of birth for the individual in the United States. A withholding agent may treat the individual as a foreign person, notwithstanding the U.S. birth place, if the withholding agent has in its possession or obtains documentary evidence described in ยง 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States and a copy of the individual's Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States. Alternatively, a withholding agent may treat the individual as a foreign person if the withholding agent obtains a valid beneficial owner withholding certificate on Form W-8 from the individual that establishes the account holder's foreign status, documentary evidence described in ยง 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States, and a reasonable written explanation of the individual's renunciation of U.S. citizenship or the reason the individual did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth.
