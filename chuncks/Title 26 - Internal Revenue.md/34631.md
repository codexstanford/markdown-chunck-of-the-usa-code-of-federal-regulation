####### Analysis,Allocation.

(ii)-(A)USP's deduction of $69,000x for state income taxes is definitely related and thus allocable to the gross income with respect to which the taxes are imposed. Since the statutes of states A, B, and C do not specifically exempt foreign source income (as determined under the Code) from taxation and since, in the aggregate, states A, B, and C tax $950,000x of USP's income while only $800,000x is domestic source income under the Code, it is presumed that state income taxes are imposed on $150,000x of foreign source income. The deduction for state income taxes is therefore related and allocable to both USP's foreign source and domestic source income.
