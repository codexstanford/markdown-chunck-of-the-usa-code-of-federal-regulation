######## Return filed by private foundation, plan, trust, or other organization.

(a)(1) A return filed by a private foundation, plan, trust, or other organization (as the case may be) with respect to any act giving rise to a tax imposed by chapter 42 (other than a tax imposed by section 4940), or by section 4975 shall be considered, for purposes of section 6501, to be the return of all persons required to file a return with respect to any such tax arising from such act, notwithstanding that all such persons have not signed the return. In the case of a private foundation that files a Form 990-PF (or a Form 5227 in the case of a nonexempt foundation described in section 4947(a)(2)), which contains questions with respect to such taxes, the filing of such form by such foundation shall constitute the filing of a return with respect to any such act, even though the foundation incorrectly answered such questions.

(2) For purposes of section 4940, the return referred to in this section is the return filed by the private foundation for the taxable year for which the tax is imposed.
