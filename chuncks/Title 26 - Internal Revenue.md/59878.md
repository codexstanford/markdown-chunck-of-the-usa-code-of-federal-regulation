###### Final payment in a series.

(3)If a payment in a series of payments from an account balance under a defined contribution plan represents the remaining balance to the credit and is substantially less than the other payments in the series, the final payment must nevertheless be treated as a payment in the series of substantially equal payments and may not be treated as an independent payment if the other payments in the series are substantially equal and the payments are for a period described in section 402(c)(4)(A) based on the rules provided in paragraph (d)(2) of Q&A-5 of this section. Thus, such final payment will not be an eligible rollover distribution.

Q-7: When is a distribution from a plan a required minimum distribution under section 401(a)(9)?
