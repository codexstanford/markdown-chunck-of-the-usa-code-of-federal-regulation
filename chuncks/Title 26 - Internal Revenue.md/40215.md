(ii)-(A)The warehouse and trucks are property for which the depreciation deduction provided by section 167(a) is eligible to be determined under section 168 (without regard to section 168(f)(1), (2), or (5), section 168(k)(2)(A)(i)(II), (IV), or (V), and the date placed in service). Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the warehouse and trucks are tangible property. Furthermore, because the warehouse and trucks are used in the production of gross tested income in Year 1 within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the warehouse and trucks are specified tangible property. Finally, because the warehouse and trucks are used in both the production of gross tested income and the production of gross income that is not gross tested income in Year 1 within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the warehouse and trucks are dual use property. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the amount of FS's adjusted basis in the warehouse and trucks that is treated as adjusted basis in specified tangible property for Year 1 is determined by multiplying FS's adjusted basis in the warehouse and trucks by FS's dual use ratio with respect to the warehouse and trucks determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
