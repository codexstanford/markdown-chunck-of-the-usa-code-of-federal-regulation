####### § 301.6402-7 Claims for refund and applications for tentative carryback adjustments involving consolidated groups that include insolvent financial institutions.
######## Absorption of net operating losses.

(iii)The absorption of net operating losses generally is determined under applicable principles of the Code and regulations, including the principles of section 172 and §§ 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21A(b) (as appropriate) of this chapter. Notwithstanding any contrary rule or principle of the Code or regulations, if an institution and another member of the carryback year group have net operating losses that arise in taxable years ending on the same date and are carried to the same consolidated carryback year, the carryback year group's consolidated taxable income for that year is treated as offset first by the loss attributable to the institution to the extent thereof.
