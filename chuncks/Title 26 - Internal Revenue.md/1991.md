####### Redeterminations increasing credit.

(iv)If a corporation's allowable additional credit is increased because of a redetermination, the increase is treated as if it were an unused credit carryover for purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(8)(i) of this section. For purposes of this subdivision (iv), the date of the increase is determined under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section as if it were the date of a reduction. Thus, for example, assume that a calendar-year corporation claims an additional credit of $100,000 in 1978 because of a qualified investment in that year. In 1980, the additional credit attributable to 1978 qualified investment is redetermined to be $110,000. With respect to the 1978 qualified investment, 1980 is also an applicable year to the extent of $10,000. The increased credit is reflected on the employer's return for 1980. The corporation must fund the TRASOP with this $10,000 under paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
