(iii)-(A)The standard mortality table for a year is the mortality table determined by applying cumulative mortality improvement factors determined under ยง 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(2)(i)(E) to the base mortality table under ยง 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) for the period beginning with 2006 and ending in the base year for the base substitute mortality table determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. For purposes of the previous sentence, the cumulative mortality improvement factors are determined using the mortality improvement rates described in ยง 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(2)(i)(C) that apply for the calendar year during which the plan sponsor submits the request for approval to use substitute mortality tables. If the plan sponsor submits such a request during 2017, then the cumulative mortality improvement factors are determined using the mortality improvement rates contained in the Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2016 Report (issued by the Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC) of the Society of Actuaries and available at).
