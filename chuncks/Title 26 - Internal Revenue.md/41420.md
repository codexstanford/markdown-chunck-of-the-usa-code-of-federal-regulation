####### Analysis

(ii)-(A) Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a separate annual PTEP account in the passive category for the 2018 taxable year is established for CFC2 as a result of USP's subpart F inclusion. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, this account contains one PTEP group, section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP.

(B) Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, in the 2019 taxable year, the 1,000,000u related to the section 959(b) distribution from CFC2 is added to CFC1's annual PTEP account for the 2018 taxable year in the passive category and to the section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP within such account. Similarly, CFC2's 2018 taxable year annual PTEP account within the passive category, and the section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP within such account, is reduced by the amount of the 1,000,000u section 959(b) distribution to CFC1. Additionally, CFC1's annual PTEP account for the 2018 taxable year in the passive category, and the section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP within such account, is reduced by the 300,000u of withholding tax imposed on CFC1 by Country X. Therefore, CFC1's annual PTEP account for the 2018 taxable year within the passive category and the section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP within such account is 700,000u.

(C) Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the 300,000u of withholding tax is translated into U.S. dollars and $300,000x is added to the PTEP group taxes with respect to CFC1's section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP within the annual PTEP account for the 2018 taxable year within the passive category.
