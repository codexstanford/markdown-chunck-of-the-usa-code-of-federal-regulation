###### ยง 1.956-1 Shareholder's pro rata share of the average of the amounts of United States property held by a controlled foreign corporation.
####### Analysis.

(B)Because USP directly owns all of the stock of FC at the end of FC's taxable year, USP's aggregate tentative section 956 amount with respect to FC is $100x, the lesser of USP's pro rata share of the average amounts of United States property held by FC ($120x) and its pro rata share of FC's applicable earnings ($100x). Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, USP's section 956 amount with respect to FC is its aggregate tentative section 956 amount with respect to FC reduced by the deduction under section 245A that USP would be allowed if USP received an amount equal to its aggregate tentative section 956 amount as a distribution with respect to the FC stock. USP would be allowed a $90x deduction under section 245A with respect to the foreign-source portion of the $100x hypothetical distribution (that is, an amount of the dividend that bears the same ratio to the dividend as the $90x of undistributed foreign earnings bears to the $100x of undistributed earnings). Accordingly, USP's section 956 amount with respect to FC is $10x, its aggregate tentative section 956 amount ($100x) with respect to FC reduced by the amount of the deduction that USP would have been allowed under section 245A with respect to the hypothetical distribution ($90x).
