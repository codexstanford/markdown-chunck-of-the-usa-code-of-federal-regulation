####### Analysis.

(ii)IC must take into account under section 481 and the administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner the $10x difference between the reserves for the relevant contracts issued prior to 2021 computed under the old basis ($110x) and the reserves for such contracts computed under the new basis ($120x). For purposes of determining the premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year as described in section 832(b)(4) for the year of change, the life insurance reserves at the end of the taxable year are $110x for contracts issued prior to 2021 (computed on the old basis) and $15x for contracts issued during 2021 (computed on the new basis). For purposes of determining the premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year as described in section 832(b)(4) for the taxable year following the year of change, the life insurance reserves at the end of the preceding taxable year (the year of change) with respect to relevant contracts are $135x (computed on the new basis).
