(iii)Notwithstanding that a taxpayer's interest in leased property would, but for the application of this paragraph (k)(2)(iii), be treated as used in a single rental real estate undertaking, the taxpayer may, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, treat a portion of the leased property (including a ratable portion of any common areas or facilities) as a rental real estate undertaking that is separate from the undertaking or undertakings in which the remaining portion of the property is treated as used. This paragraph (k)(2)(iii) shall apply for a taxable year if and only if-

(A) Such portion of the leased property can be separately conveyed under applicable State and local law (taking into account the limitations, if any, imposed by any special rules or procedures, such as condominium conversion laws, restricting the separate conveyance of parts of the same structure); and

(B) The taxpayer holds such leased property directly or through one or more passthrough entities, each of which treats such portion of the leased property as a separate activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity for the taxable year of the taxpayer.
