####### Example 4: Addition of a fallback waterfall that is not a qualified rate,1,Facts.,1,Example 1,Fallback Rate X,Benchmark X

(D)-()The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)() of this section (), except that the new fallbacks provide for a fallback waterfall. The first tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of six-month USD LIBOR, six-month USD LIBOR will be replaced by a stated fallback rate (). Fallback Rate X, which is equal to an interest rate benchmark () plus a fixed spread, satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section. The second tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of Benchmark X, B will select a replacement for Fallback Rate X based on the industry standard at the time of selection. At the time of the fallback waterfall's addition, the likelihood that Benchmark X will be discontinued is not remote.
