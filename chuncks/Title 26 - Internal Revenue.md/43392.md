() The fair market value at the cutoff point is deemed to be the amount of the gross income from the property of the taxpayer eligible for a depletion deduction with respect to the mineral, except that, if () the fair market value of a product or commodity on the date specified in subdivision (v)() of this subparagraph exceeds the aggregate of the fair market value at the cutoff point for each mineral contained therein and () 10 percent or more of such excess is attributable to a net increase in the fair market values of such minerals by reason of factors other than manufacturing or processing or the application of excluded processes (such as, for example, increases in the fair market values of some minerals by reason of inflation or speculation exceed decreases in such values of other minerals by reason of deflation or speculation), then the aggregate of the fair market value at the cutoff point for each such mineral shall be increased to reflect the net excess so attributable.
