##### ยง 303.1-4 Computation of taxes.
###### Tentative computation.

(e)In order that the return of property or other appropriate action may not be delayed until the amount of taxes payable is finally computed and paid, a tentative computation of such amount will be made in every case, unless there are circumstances appearing to make such action inappropriate. Such circumstances would include (1) return of the property in accordance with ยง 303.1-3, (2) notice to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the person to whom the property is returnable or by the Attorney General that such person or the Attorney General, as the case may be, prefers that the return of the property be postponed until the amount of such taxes can be finally computed, or (3) belief on the part of the Commissioner that a final computation will not unduly delay the return of, or other appropriate action with respect to, the property. In making any such tentative computation of income or estate tax, the gross income or the gross estate, as the case may be, as shown by the records of the Attorney General (excluding therefrom items exempt from taxation) shall be considered as the taxable income or taxable estate, respectively, unless a tax return has been filed or facts are available upon which a more accurate computation can be made. In any case in which a duly authorized officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service has otherwise computed the amount of taxes payable in respect of any period, such computation will be accepted as a tentative computation, unless the facts clearly indicate that a more accurate computation can be made.
