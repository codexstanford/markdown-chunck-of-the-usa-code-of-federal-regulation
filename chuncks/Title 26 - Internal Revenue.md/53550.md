####### Section 338(h)(10) election.

(ii)Immediately after the Controlled Distribution, Parent and B are not related as determined under section 338(h)(3)(A)(iii). Further, B's basis in the T stock is not determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the adjusted basis of the T stock in the hands of Parent, and the stock is not acquired in an exchange to which section 351, 354, 355, or 356 applies. Accordingly, the T Exchange qualifies as a "purchase" within the meaning of section 338(h)(3). Pursuant to the section 338(h)(10) election, Old T is treated as transferring all of its assets, including Equipment #7, to an unrelated person in a single transaction in exchange for consideration at the close of the acquisition date (January 1, 2019), and New T is treated as acquiring all of its assets, including Equipment #7, from an unrelated person in exchange for consideration.
