###### Change in purpose of hedging transaction.,i.e.,

(ii)If a hedging transaction is entered into for one purpose, and the purpose for that transaction subsequently changes, the transaction may be treated as two separate hedging transactions for purposes of this paragraph (g)(4). In such a case, the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction is considered a qualified hedging transaction if it separately meets all the other requirements of this paragraph (g)(4) for treatment as a qualified hedging transaction. For purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C), the foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedge becomes so related (either the day on which the hedge is first entered into or on the day on which it first relates to a qualified business transaction due to a change in its purpose). The foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that does not relate to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the purpose for the hedging transaction changes.
