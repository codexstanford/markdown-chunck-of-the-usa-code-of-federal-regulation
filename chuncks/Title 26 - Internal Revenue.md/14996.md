####### Applicability to taxable years otherwise subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

(c)The net income of a taxable year otherwise subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be recomputed pursuant to section 270 if (i) such taxable year is included in a period of five consecutive taxable years which includes at least one taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, and (ii) the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions specified in section 270(b)) for each taxable year in such five-year period exceed the $50,000 limitation specified in section 270. As described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a taxable year may be part of two or more periods of five consecutive taxable years, one meeting the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 130 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the other meeting the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 270 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, then the recomputation for such taxable year shall be made pursuant to section 270. For example, if a calendar year taxpayer sustains a loss from a trade or business for each of the years 1949 through 1954, the years 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953 may be a part of two such periods of five consecutive taxable years. If, however, a taxable year is part of a period of five consecutive taxable years which meets the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 130 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, but is not part of a period which meets the requirements for recomputation, pursuant to section 270, then a recomputation of net income for such taxable year must be made pursuant to section 130.
