###### § 1.6049-6 Statements to recipients of interest payments and holders of obligations for attributed original issue discount.
####### Form, manner, and time for providing statements to recipients.,See

(2)The statement required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be either the official Form 1099 prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for the respective calendar year or an acceptable substitute statement. The rules under § 1.6042-4 (relating to statements with respect to dividends) apply comparably in determining the form of an acceptable substitute statement permitted by this paragraph (e). Those rules also apply for purposes of determining the manner of and time for providing the Form 1099 or its acceptable substitute to a recipient under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. However, with respect to original issue discount, the Form 1099 or acceptable substitute statement required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must show the aggregate amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income by the recipient for the calendar year with respect to the obligation (determined by applying the rules of § 1.6049-4(b)(2)), and the amount, serial number, or other identifying number of each obligation with respect to which a return is being made. With respect to interest or original issue discount, the Form 1099 or acceptable substitute statement required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be furnished to the recipient on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year for which the return under section 6049(a)(1) was required to be made. However, for a statement required to be furnished after December 31, 2008, the February 15 due date under section 6045 applies to the statement if the statement is furnished in a consolidated reporting statement under section 6045.§§ 1.6045-1(k)(3), 1.6045-2(d)(2), 1.6045-3(e)(2), 1.6045-4(m)(3), and 1.6045-5(a)(3)(ii).
