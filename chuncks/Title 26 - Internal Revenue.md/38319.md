###### ยง 1.904-5 Look-through rules as applied to controlled foreign corporations and other entities.
####### Example 6.

(F)CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. CFC1 and CFC2 are incorporated in the same country. In Year 1, USP sells tractors to CFC2, which CFC2 sells to X, a foreign corporation that is related to both CFC1 and CFC2 and is organized in the same country as CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 makes a loan to x to finance the tractor sales. Assume that the interest earned by CFC1 from financing the sales is export financing interest that is neither related person factoring income nor foreign personal holding company income. Under ยง 1.904-4(h), the export financing interest earned by CFC1 is, therefore, general category income. CFC1 earns no other income. CFC1 makes a $100x interest payment to USP. The $100x of interest paid is not allocable under the look-through rules and paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to passive category income of CFC1. The income is general category income to USP.
