###### ยง 1.83-3 Meaning and use of certain terms.
####### Relationship to fair market value.

(5)An indication that no transfer has occurred is the extent to which the consideration to be paid the transferee upon surrendering the property does not approach the fair market value of the property at the time of surrender. For purposes of paragraph (a) (5) and (6) of this section, fair market value includes fair market value determined under the rules of ยง 1.83-5(a)(1), relating to the valuation of property subject to nonlapse restrictions. Therefore, the existence of a nonlapse restriction referred to in ยง 1.83-5(a)(1) is not a factor indicating no transfer has occurred.
