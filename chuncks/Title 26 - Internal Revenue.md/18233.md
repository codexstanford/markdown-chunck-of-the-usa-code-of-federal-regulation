(3)The net operating loss deduction of the preacquisition part year and the partial postacquisition years shall be determined consistently with the manner described in paragraph (f)(6) of ยง 1.381(c)(1)-1 but by taking into account, in the case of any partial postacquisition year, only the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation and those net operating loss carryovers from a distributor or transferor corporation which become available to the acquiring corporation as of the close of those dates of distribution or transfer which occur before the beginning of that specific partial postacquisition year. The sequence in which the net operating losses of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations shall be applied for this purpose shall be determined in the manner described in paragraph (e) of ยง 1.381(c)(1)-1. Subject to the preceding sentence, the net operating loss carryovers to any specific partial postacquisition year, whether from a distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation, shall be taken into account in the order of the taxable years in which the net operating losses arose, beginning with the loss for the earliest taxable year.
