####### Annualization exception.

(3)The subsequent installment payment of a corporation satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) if the amount of the payment is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 6655(d)(3) with respect to all applicable taxes specified in section 6655(f). Thus, the corporation must determine its annualized taxable income under section 6655(d)(3)(A) (ii) or (iii), whichever is applicable, and compute the resulting tax. The resulting tax shall include the alternative minimum tax under section 55 and the environmental tax under section 59A and may take credits into account to the extent permitted under section 6655(d)(3). The sum of this subsequent installment payment and the earlier installment payment or payments of the corporation must equal or exceed the applicable percentage of the tax so computed. In determining whether the corporation has satisfied the requirements of section 6655(d)(3)(A) (ii) or (iii) with respect to the subsequent installment, the safe harbor provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply.
