###### ยง 1.9000-6 Provisions for the waiver of interest.
####### Limitation on application of waiver.

(b)The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any portion of the increase in tax shown on the statement if such increase reflects an amount in excess of that attributable solely to the repeal of sections 452 and 462, i. e., is attributable in whole or in part to excessive or unwarranted deferrals or accruals under section 452 or 462, as the case may be, in computing the tax liability with the application of such sections. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, paragraph (a) of this section shall be applicable if the taxpayer can show that the tax liability as computed with the application of sections 452 and 462 is based upon a reasonable interpretation and application of such sections as they existed prior to repeal. If the taxpayer complied with the provisions of the regulations under sections 452 and 462 in computing the tax liability with the application of such sections, he will be regarded as having reasonably interpreted and applied sections 452 and 462. In this regard, it is not essential that the taxpayer submit with his return the detailed information required by such regulations in support of the deduction claimed under section 462, but such information shall be supplied at the request of the Commissioner.
