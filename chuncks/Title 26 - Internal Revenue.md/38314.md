() In order to apportion third person interest (that was not directly allocated third person interest) between the categories of assets, the value of assets in a separate category must also be reduced under the principles of ยง 1.861-8 by the indebtedness relating to the specifically allocated interest. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the value of assets in the passive category for purposes of apportioning the additional third person interest = 0 ($2,000x minus $500x (the principal amount of the debt, the interest payment on which is directly allocated to specific interest-producing properties) minus $1,500x (the related person debt allocated to passive category assets)). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, all $100x of the non-definitely related third person interest expense is apportioned to the general category ($100x = $100x x $2,000x/($4,000x - $500x - $1,500x)).
