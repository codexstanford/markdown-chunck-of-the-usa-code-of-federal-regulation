() After deduction of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. A total of $51.81 of SRLY net operating losses were absorbed in Year 4 ($50 + $1.81). After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $64.76 ($64.76 x 80 percent = $51.81). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $64.76, and $5.24 remains in the cumulative register ($70-$64.76).
