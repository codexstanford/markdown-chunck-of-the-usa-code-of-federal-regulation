Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the excess deductions of $800x must be reallocated to the $200x of net royalty income subject to a 5% withholding tax and the $400x of net rental income subject to a 15% or greater withholding tax. The income in each of these groups is reduced to zero, and the foreign taxes imposed on the rental and royalty income are considered related to general category income. The remaining loss of $200x constitutes a separate limitation loss with respect to passive category income.
