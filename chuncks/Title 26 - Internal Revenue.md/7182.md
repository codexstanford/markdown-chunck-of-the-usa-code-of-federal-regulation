####### 2,Conclusion.

()Because the compensation paid by affiliated group members is aggregated for purposes of section 162(m)(1), $2,000,000 of the aggregate compensation paid is nondeductible. Corporations P, Q, and R each are treated as paying a ratable portion of the nondeductible compensation. Thus, two thirds of each corporation's payment will be nondeductible. The nondeductible compensation expense for Corporation P is $1,000,000 ($1,500,000 x $2,000,000/$3,000,000); for Corporation Q is $600,000 ($900,000 x $2,000,000/$3,000,000); and for Corporation R is $400,000 ($600,000 x $2,000,000/$3,000,000).
