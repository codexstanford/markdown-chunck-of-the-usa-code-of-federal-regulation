###### ยง 25.2514-3 Powers of appointment created after October 21, 1942.
####### Partial releases, lapses, and disclaimers of general powers of appointment created after October 21, 1942,Partial release of power.

(c)-(1)The general principles set forth in ยง 25.2511-2 for determining whether a donor of property (or of a property right or interest) has divested himself of all or any portion of his interest therein to the extent necessary to effect a completed gift are applicable in determining whether a partial release of a power of appointment constitutes a taxable gift. Thus, if a general power of appointment is partially released so that thereafter the donor may still appoint among a limited class of persons not including himself the partial release does not effect a complete gift, since the possessor of the power has retained the right to designate the ultimate beneficiaries of the property over which he holds the power and since it is only the termination of such control which completes a gift.
