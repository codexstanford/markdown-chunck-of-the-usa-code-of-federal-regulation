A purchaser or lessee is not treated as a FSC or interest charge DISC with respect to a sale or lease during a taxable year for which the purchaser or lessee does not qualify as a FSC or interest charge DISC if the seller or lessor does not believe or if a reasonable person would not believe at the time the sale or lease is made that the purchaser or lessee will qualify as a FSC or interest charge DISC for the taxable year.

(v) If a seller or lessor fails to provide proof of compliance with the destination test as required by this paragraph (d)(3), the property sold or leased is not export property.
