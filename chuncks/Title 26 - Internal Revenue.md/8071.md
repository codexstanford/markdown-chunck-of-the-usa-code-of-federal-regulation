####### Analysis.

(B)For purposes of section 163(j), each of T's tax items is treated as properly allocable to a trade or business. Thus, T's ATI for the 2021 taxable year is $520x ($320x of tentative taxable income + $200x business interest expense-$50x business interest income + $50x depreciation deductions = $520x), and its section 163(j) limitation for the 2021 taxable year is $206x ($50x of business interest income + 30 percent of its ATI (30 percent x $520x) = $206x). As a result, all $200x of T's interest expense is deductible in the 2021 taxable year under section 163(j).
