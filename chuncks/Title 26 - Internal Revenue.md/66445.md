######## Articles made for immediate installation or repair.

(2)If in connection with an immediate installation in an automobile truck, other automobile, or tractor an article is produced through the use of special machinery or as a result of specialized skills from lengths or rolls of material, the person producing such article is considered to have manufactured an automobile part or accessory and the tax applies to his sale of such part or accessory. For example, tax applies to the sale of automobile glass cut to size to replace broken glass, or automobile seat covers, automobile floor mats, or fitted truck top covers produced to replace worn seat covers, floor mats, or truck top covers. However, if an article of a minor nature is produced by simple operation from lengths or rolls of material for immediate use by a repairman in the repair of an automobile truck, other automobile, or tractor on which he is then working, the person producing such article is not considered to have manufactured an automobile part or accessory and tax does not apply on his sale of such article. For example, tax does not apply where a wire, hose, or board is cut to size in order to replace a damaged wire, hose, or board of an automobile truck, other automobile, or tractor.
