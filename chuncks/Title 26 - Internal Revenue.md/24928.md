####### Analysis.

(B)For Federal income tax purposes, B must take $40 of the advance payment into income in its short tax year ending October 31, 2021. B's subsequent tax year, the short tax year ending December 31, 2021, is a tax year that is 92 days or less. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, B generally will include the portion of the advance payment not included in the taxable year of receipt in gross income for this short taxable year to the extent taken into account as AFS revenue. Although for AFS purposes, no amount is recognized in revenue for the short period beginning November 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2021, under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, B must treat the amount of the write-down as AFS revenue in the taxable year in which the write-down occurs. Therefore, B must include $50 of the advance payment into income in the short tax year ending December 31, 2021 (equal to the $50 write down plus $0 recognized in B's AFS for the period beginning on November 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2021), and must include the remainder of the advance payment ($10) in income for the 2022 taxable year.
