###### ยง 1.430(h)(3)-2 Plan-specific substitute mortality tables used to determine present value.
####### Change in number of individuals covered by table.

(v)Experience data may not be used to develop a base table if the number of individuals in the population covered by the table (for example, the male annuitant population) as of the last day of the plan year before the year the request for approval to use the substitute mortality table is made is less than 80 percent or more than 120 percent of the average number of individuals in that population over the years covered by the experience study on which the substitute mortality tables are based, unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the experience data is accurately predictive of future mortality of that population (taking into account the effect of the change in individuals) after appropriate adjustments to the data are made (for example, excluding data from individuals with respect to a spun-off portion of the plan). For this purpose, a reasonable estimate of the number of individuals in the population covered by the table may be used.
