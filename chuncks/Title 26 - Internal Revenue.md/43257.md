###### ยง 1.993-1 Definition of qualified export receipts.
####### Sales or lease of export property and furnishing of engineering or architectural services for use by the United States,In general.

(4)-(i)Qualified export receipts of a DISC do not include gross receipts described in paragraph (b), (c), or (h) of this section if a sale or lease of export property, or the furnishing of engineering or architectural services, is for use by the United States or an instrumentality thereof in any case in which any law or regulation requires in any manner the purchase or lease of property manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States or requires the use of engineering or architectural services performed by a U.S. person. For example, a sale by a DISC of export property to the Department of Defense for use outside the United States would not produce qualified export receipts for such DISC if the Department of Defense purchased such property from appropriated funds subject to any provisions of the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (32 CFR subchapter A, part 6, subpart A) or any appropriations act for the Department of Defense for the applicable year which restricts the availability of such appropriated funds to the procurement of items which are grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States.
