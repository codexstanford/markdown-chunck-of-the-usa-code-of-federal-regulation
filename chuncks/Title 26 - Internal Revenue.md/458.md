() L and M are members of K's family as defined in ยง 1.36B-1(d). Under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section, K's employer's coverage is affordable for K because K's required contribution for self-only coverage does not exceed the required contribution percentage of K's and L's household income. Similarly, L's employer's coverage is affordable for L, because L's required contribution for self-only coverage does not exceed the required contribution percentage of K's and L's household income. Thus, K and L are eligible for minimum essential coverage for all months in 2023. However, under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section, K's employer's coverage is unaffordable for M, because K's required contribution for coverage of K, L, and M exceeds the required contribution percentage of K's and L's household income. Accordingly, M is not eligible for minimum essential coverage for 2023.
