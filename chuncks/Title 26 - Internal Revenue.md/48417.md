()Taxpayer's taxable year is the calendar year. On October 5, Year 1, Taxpayer buys 100 shares of publicly traded Exchange Traded Fund A (ETF A) and acquires offsetting section 1256 contracts on the index that underlies the ETF A shares. Taxpayer makes a valid and timely identification of all 100 ETF A shares and the offsetting section 1256 contracts under ยง 1.1092(b)-3T. On December 31, Year 1, the fair market value of the ETF A shares has increased by $500, and the fair market value of the section 1256 contracts has decreased by $450. On December 31, Year 1, Taxpayer sells the ETF shares for a $500 gain. In addition, under section 1256(a)(1), the section 1256 contracts are treated as sold for fair market value on December 31, Year 1, for a $450 loss. Pursuant to ยง 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(4), Taxpayer has a net short term capital gain from the identified mixed straddle of $50 ($500-$450). Under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C) of this section, paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section does not apply to prevent the $50 of net short term capital gain from being eligible gain.
