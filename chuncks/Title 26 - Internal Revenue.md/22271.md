###### ยง 1.414(q)-1T Highly compensated employee (temporary).
####### Other employee benefit plans.

(3)The exception in paragraph (b)(2) of this A-7 is not applicable to the determination of the highly compensated employee group for purposes of the sections enumerated in section 414(n)(3)(C). Thus, for example, a leased employee covered by a safe-harbor plan is considered to be an employee in applying the nondiscrimination provisions of section 89 to statutory benefit plans. Consequently, an employer with leased employees covered in a safe-harbor plan may have 2 groups of highly compensated employees, one with respect to its retirement plans and another with respect to its statutory benefit plans.
