###### § 1.752-7 Partnership assumption of partner's § 1.752-7 liability on or after June 24, 2003.
####### Amount and share of § 1.752-7 liability.

(ii)The amount of a § 1.752-7 liability (or, for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the amount of an obligation) is the amount of cash that a willing assignor would pay to a willing assignee to assume the § 1.752-7 liability in an arm's-length transaction. If the obligation arose under a contract in exchange for rights granted to the obligor under that contract, and those contractual rights are contributed to the partnership in connection with the partnership's assumption of the contractual obligation, then the amount of the § 1.752-7 liability or obligation is the amount of cash, if any, that a willing assignor would pay to a willing assignee to assume the entire contract. A partner's share of a partnership's § 1.752-7 liability is the amount of deduction that would be allocated to the partner with respect to the § 1.752-7 liability if the partnership disposed of all of its assets, satisfied all of its liabilities (other than § 1.752-7 liabilities), and paid an unrelated person to assume all of its § 1.752-7 liabilities in a fully taxable arm's-length transaction (assuming such payment would give rise to an immediate deduction to the partnership).
