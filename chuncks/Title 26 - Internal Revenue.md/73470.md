(F)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(2)(v)(E) of this section, except in addition to the modification with respect to C's tax-exempt status, Partnership requests a modification under § 301.6225-2(d)(2) (regarding amended returns) with respect to the $100,000 of additional income allocated to D. In accordance with the rules under § 301.6225-2(d)(2), D files an amended return for D's 2019 taxable year taking into account $100,000 of additional ordinary income. In addition, in accordance with § 301.6225-2(d)(2)(viii), D takes into account on D's return the 20-percent accuracy-related penalty for negligence or disregard of rules or regulations that relates to the ordinary income adjustment. D's tax attributes for other taxable years are not affected. The IRS approves the modification request. As a result, Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment under § 301.6225-1(b)(2) is $200,000 ($400,000 less $100,000 allocable to C and $100,000 taken into account by D). The imputed underpayment, after modification, is $80,000 ($200,000 x 40 percent), and the penalty is $16,000 ($80,000 x 20 percent).
