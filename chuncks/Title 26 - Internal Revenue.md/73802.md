###### General Provisions
####### ยง 301.6324-1 Special liens for estate and gift taxes; personal liability of transferees and others.
######## Lien for gift tax.

(b)Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a lien attaches upon all gifts made during the period for which the return was filed (see ยง 25.6019-1 of this chapter) for the amount of tax imposed upon the gifts made during such period. The lien extends for a period of 10 years from the time the gifts are made, unless the tax is sooner paid in full or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time. If the tax is not paid when due, the donee of any gift becomes personally liable for the tax to the extent of the value of his gift. Any part of the property comprised in the gift transferred by the donee (or by a transferee of the donee) to a purchaser or holder of a security interest is divested of the lien, but a like lien, to the extent of the value of the gift, attaches to all the property (including after-acquired property) of the donee (or the transferee) except any part transferred to a purchaser or holder of a security interest. See section 6323(h) (1) and (6) and the regulations thereunder, respectively, for the definitions of "security interest" and "purchaser."
