####### ii,Dual use ratio.

()Because none of the depreciation with respect to Asset C is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, FC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C. Therefore, FC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C is 60%, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of FC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C that is allocated and apportioned to FC's gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3) for Year 1 ($3x), divided by the total amount of FC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C for Year 1 ($5x).
