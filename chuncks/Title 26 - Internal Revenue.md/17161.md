####### Filing the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement.

(ii)In general, the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement is filed by the person or entity described in the applicable paragraph of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii). Thus, if Transferor is a partnership, S corporation, trust (including a subpart E trust), or other pass-through entity, or Acquiring is an S corporation, the entity (and not the partners, shareholders, or other persons having an interest in the entity or its property) is the person that must file the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement, without regard to whether such entity is foreign or domestic. However, in the case of a CFC or CFP, the controlling U.S. shareholders of the CFC or the reporting U.S. partners of the CFP, respectively, file the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement.
