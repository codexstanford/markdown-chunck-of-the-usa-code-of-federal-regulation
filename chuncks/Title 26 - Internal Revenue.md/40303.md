()CFC2's holding of Asset C as of March 31, Year 1, June 30, Year 1, September 30, Year 1, and December 31, Year 1 does not satisfy the safe harbor under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section because CFC1 is not a tested income CFC for Year 1 and thus the requirement in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(D) of this section is not satisfied. Because CFC2 acquired Asset C before, and temporarily held as of, March 31, Year 1, June 30, Year 1, September 30, Year 1, December 31, Year 1 and the holding of the property by CFC2 as of each such tested quarter close would increase the deemed tangible income return of USP, under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis in Asset C is disregarded in determining CFC2's aggregate adjusted basis in specified tangible property as of each of March 31, Year 1, June 30, Year 1, September 30, Year 1, and December 31, Year 1.
