()-()Without regard to the combination rule of paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(C) of this section, CFC1X, CFC1X's interest in FDEX, CFC1X's interest in FDE1Y, and FBY would each be a tested unit of CFC1X.paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(A) of this section. Pursuant to the combination rule, however, the FDE1Y tested unit is combined with the FBY tested unit and treated as a single tested unit because FDE1Y is a tax resident of Country Y, the same country in which FBY is located (the "Country Y tested unit").paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(C)() of this section. The CFC1X tested unit (without regard to any items attributable to the FDEX, FDE1Y, or FBY tested units) is also combined with the FDEX tested unit and treated as a single tested unit because CFC1X and FDEX are both tax residents of County X (the "Country X tested unit").paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(C)() of this section.
