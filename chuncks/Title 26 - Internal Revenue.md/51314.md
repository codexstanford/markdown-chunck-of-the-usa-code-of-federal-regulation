####### ii,Late-joining electing FFIs.

()In general, with respect to a certification period, a compliance FI is not required to make a certification for an electing FFI that first elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program of the compliance FI during the six-month period before the end of the certification period, provided that the compliance FI makes certifications for such electing FFI for subsequent certification periods, and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the compliance group during which such FFI was an electing FFI in the consolidated compliance program of the compliance FI. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to an electing FFI that, immediately before the electing FFI elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program, was a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. The compliance FI may certify for an electing FFI described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the compliance group before the date that the electing FFI elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program if the compliance FI obtains from the FFI (or the FFI's former compliance FI, if applicable) a written certification that the FFI has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: The compliance FI does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the electing FFI for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period during which such FFI was an electing FFI in the consolidated compliance program of the compliance FI.
