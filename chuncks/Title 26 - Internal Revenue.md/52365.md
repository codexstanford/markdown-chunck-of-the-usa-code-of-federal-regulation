###### § 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Separate-entity application of QOF qualifying rules to QOF member.

(v)A consolidated group is not treated as a single entity for purposes of determining whether a QOF member or a qualified opportunity zone business that is a consolidated group member satisfies the investment standard rules in section 1400Z-2(d) and (f) and §§ 1.1400Z2(d)-1 and 1.1400Z2(f)-1. Instead, those investment standard rules apply on a separate-entity basis. Therefore, for example, the QOF member's satisfaction of the requirements under section 1400Z-2(d) is determined by taking into account only property (including qualified opportunity zone stock or qualified opportunity zone partnership interests) held by the QOF member, without regard to property transferred by the QOF member to other members of the consolidated group.
