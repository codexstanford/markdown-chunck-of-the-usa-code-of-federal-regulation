# Title 26 - Internal Revenue
## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter F - Procedure and Administration
#### PART 400 - TEMPORARY REGULATIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL TAX LIEN ACT OF 1966
##### ยง 400.5-1 Redemption by United States.
###### Limitations.

(3)In the event a sale does not ultimately discharge the property from the tax lien (whether by reason of local law or the provisions of section 7425(b)), the provisions of this section do not apply since the tax lien will continue to attach to the property after the sale. In a case in which the Internal Revenue Service is not entitled to a notice of sale under section 7425(b) and ยง 400.4-1, the United States does not have a right of redemption under section 7425(d). However, in such a case, if a tax lien has attached to the property at the time of sale, the United States has the same right of redemption, if any, which is afforded to any secured creditor under the local law of the place in which the property is situated.
