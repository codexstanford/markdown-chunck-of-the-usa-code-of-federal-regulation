(B)-()The disregarded payment from FDE to P in Year 1 is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, and does not generate gross income. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)()() of this section, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE to the extent of any disregarded cost recovery deduction relating to that payment in Year 2. Under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, the disregarded cost recovery deduction with respect to Asset A is $30x, which is $50x (the amount that would be allowed as a deduction, and that would give rise to an adjustment described in section 1016(a)(2), with respect to Asset A if the transfer of Asset A to FDE were regarded for Federal income tax purposes, to the extent that the deduction would be allocable to income attributable to a foreign branch), reduced by $20x (the amount allowed as a deduction, and that gives rise to an adjustment described in section 1016(a)(2), with respect to Asset A, to the extent allocable to income attributable to a foreign branch). If regarded, $27x (90% of $30x) of the disregarded cost recovery deduction would be allocated and apportioned to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and $3x (10% of $30x) would be allocated and apportioned to passive category gross income under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T. Accordingly, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)() of this section, the $315x of non-passive category gross income that would otherwise be attributed to FDE is reduced to $288x ($315x less $27x), and the non-passive category gross income attributable to P is increased by $27x in Year 2. As a result, in Year 2, P's foreign branch category gross income is $288x, and its general category gross income is increased by $27x. P's passive category gross income is $35x.paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section.
