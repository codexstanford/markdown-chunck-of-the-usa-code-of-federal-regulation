###### § 1.752-7 Partnership assumption of partner's § 1.752-7 liability on or after June 24, 2003.
####### Consequences to assuming partner.

(4)No deduction, loss, or capital expense is allowed to an assuming partner (other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner) on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability assumed from a partnership to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability. Instead, upon the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the assuming partner must adjust the basis of the partnership interest, any assets (other than cash, accounts receivable, or inventory) distributed by the partnership to the partner, or gain or loss on the disposition of the partnership interest, as the case may be. These adjustments are determined as if the assuming partner's basis in the partnership interest at the time of the assumption were increased by the lesser of the amount paid (or to be paid) to satisfy the § 1.752-7 liability or the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability. However, the assuming partner cannot take into account any adjustments to depreciable basis, reduction in gain, or increase in loss until the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability.
