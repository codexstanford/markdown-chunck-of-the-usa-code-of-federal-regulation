####### § 301.6223-2 Binding effect of actions of the partnership and partnership representative.
######## Actions by the partnership representative before termination of designation.

(b)A termination of the designation of a partnership representative because of a resignation under § 301.6223-1(d) or a revocation under § 301.6223-1(e), or as a result of a determination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under § 301.6223-1(f) that the designation is not in effect, does not affect the validity of any action taken by that partnership representative during the period prior to such termination. For example, if a partnership representative properly designated under § 301.6223-1 consented to an extension of the period of limitations on making adjustments under section 6235(b) in accordance with § 301.6235-1(d), that extension remains valid even after termination of the designation of that partnership representative.
