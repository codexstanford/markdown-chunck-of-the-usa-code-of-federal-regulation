() The interest expense on U.S.-connected liabilities, as described in ยง 1.882-5(d) or 1.882-5(e), in excess of interest expense on U.S.-booked liabilities as described in ยง 1.882-5(d)(2), if any (hereafter, excess U.S.-connected liabilities), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the foreign corporation's average worldwide interest expense due to a foreign related party, and the denominator of which is the foreign corporation's average total worldwide interest expense. The numerator and denominator of this fraction are determined by translating interest expense into the functional currency of the foreign corporation using any reasonable method, consistently applied. Any interest expense that is interest expense on a U.S.-booked liability or is subject to a direct allocation is excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction.
