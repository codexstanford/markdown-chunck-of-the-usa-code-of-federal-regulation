####### General rule.

(a)(1) In addition to the adjustments provided in section 1016 and other applicable provisions of chapter 1 of the Code which adjustments are required to be made with respect to the cost or other basis of property, a further adjustment shall be made in the amount of the unrecognized gain under section 1071, if the taxpayer so elects. Such further adjustment shall be made only with respect to the cost or other basis of property which is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167 (whether or not used in connection with a broadcasting business), and which remains in the hands of the taxpayer immediately after the sale or exchange in respect of which the election is made, or which is acquired by the taxpayer in the same taxable year in which such sale or exchange occurs. If the property is in the hands of the taxpayer immediately after the sale or exchange, the time of reduction of the basis is the date of the sale or exchange; in all other cases the time of reduction of the basis is the date of acquisition.
