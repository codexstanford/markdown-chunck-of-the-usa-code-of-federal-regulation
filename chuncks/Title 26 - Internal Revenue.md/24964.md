####### Analysis.

(B)The payments R receives from the sale of gift cards are advance payments because they are payments for eligible gift card sales. For Federal income tax purposes, R is eligible to use the deferral method. Using the deferral method, in the taxable year of receipt, R must include the advance payment in income to the extent taken into account as AFS revenue and must include any remaining amount in income in the taxable year following the taxable year of receipt. Under paragraph (c)(9) of this section, R is treated as taking into account revenue from the sale of a gift card as AFS revenue when a gift card is redeemed at a participating restaurant.
