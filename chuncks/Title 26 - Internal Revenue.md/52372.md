####### Treatment of S's intercompany gain on its qualifying investment.

(B)If a transaction is described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, ยง 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii) is inapplicable in determining the excludability of S's gain (or the treatment of such gain as tax-exempt income) on the application of section 1400Z-2(b) and (c) to S and B as a single entity. Thus, S's gain on the qualifying investment (including the amount includible under ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)) may be redetermined to be excluded from gross income (or treated as tax-exempt income), as appropriate, to achieve single-entity treatment between S and B with regard to the ownership and disposal of the qualifying investment. To qualify for benefits under section 1400Z-2, S and B must otherwise satisfy the requirements of section 1400Z-2. See also ยง 1.1502-13(j)(4) (concerning multiple or successive intercompany transactions).
