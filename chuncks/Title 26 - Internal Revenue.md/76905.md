##### ยง 303.1-4 Computation of taxes.
###### Periods for which computations made.

(d)The amount of income, employment, and excise taxes under the internal revenue laws will be computed for each taxable year or period during all or part of which property is vested prior to the return of the property. In the case of a return of property prior to computation of tax, see ยง 303.1-3. Where vesting occurs during a taxable year or taxable period, any return filed or computation made covering vested or nonvested property should nevertheless be for the entire year or period. See paragraph (b) of this section. Unless facts are available indicating a liability for taxes for a taxable year or period occurring wholly prior or subsequent to the period of vesting of the property by the Attorney General, the computations under this part, both tentative and final, will be made only in respect of years and periods during all or part of which the property is held by the Attorney General.
