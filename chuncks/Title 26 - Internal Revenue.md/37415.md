(iii)A foreign levy that is treated as an income tax under the relief from double taxation article of an income tax treaty entered into by the United States and the foreign country imposing the levy is a foreign income tax if the levy is, as determined under such income tax treaty, paid by a citizen or resident of the United States that elects benefits under the treaty. In addition, a foreign levy (including a foreign levy paid by a controlled foreign corporation) that is modified by an applicable income tax treaty to which the foreign country imposing the levy is a party may qualify as a foreign income tax notwithstanding that the unmodified foreign levy does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the requirements of ยง 1.903-1(b) if the levy, as modified by such treaty, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or the requirements of ยง 1.903-1(b). See paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section for rules treating as a separate levy a foreign tax that is limited in its application or otherwise modified by the terms of an income tax treaty to which the foreign country imposing the tax is a party.
