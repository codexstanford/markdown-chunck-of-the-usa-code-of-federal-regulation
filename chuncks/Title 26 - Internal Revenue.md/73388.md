####### ยง 301.6231(c)-2 Special rules for certain refund claims based on losses, deductions, or credits from abusive tax shelter partnerships.
######## Claims subject to this section.

(a)This section applies in the case of a claim for credit or refund based on losses, deductions or credits of a partnership if the Commissioner, or the Commissioner's delegate, determines, after review of available relevant information, that it is highly likely that a person described in section 6700(a)(1) made, with respect to the partnership-

(1) A gross valuation overstatement; or

(2) A false or fraudulent statement with respect to the tax benefits to be secured by reason of holding an interest in the partnership that would be subject to a penalty under section 6700 (relating to penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.). This section applies only with respect to a claim that is based upon the partner's original reporting on the partner's income tax return of partnership losses, deductions, or credits. Thus, this section does not apply to a request for administrative adjustment under section 6227 through which a partner seeks to change the partner's reporting of partnership items on the partner's income tax return (or on an earlier request for administrative adjustment). For purposes of this section, any income tax return requesting a credit or refund shall be treated as a claim for a credit or refund.
