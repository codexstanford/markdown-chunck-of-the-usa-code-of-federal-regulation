### Subchapter C - Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax at Source
#### PART 32 - TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE ACT OF DECEMBER 29, 1981 (PUB. L. 97-123)
##### § 32.1 Social security taxes with respect to payments on account of sickness or accident disability.
###### Payments by third parties.

(e)(1) Any third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability which payment is not excluded from the term "wages" under paragraph (a) of this section shall be treated as the employer with respect to such wages, except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. Accordingly, such third party must withhold from such payment the tax imposed on the employee by section 3101, pay the tax imposed on employers by section 3111, deposit such taxes pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-1(a), and provide the receipts required by section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2.

(2) If any third party who is treated as the employer solely by reason of the applicability of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph promptly-

(i) Withholds the tax imposed on the employee by section 3101,

(ii) Deposits such tax pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-1(a), and

(iii) Notifies the employer for whom services are normally rendered of the amount of the wages paid on which tax was withheld and deposited,

(3) A third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability to an employee as agent for the employer or making such a payment directly to the employer shall not be treated as the employer under subparagraph (1) with respect to such payment unless the agency agreement so provides. The determining factor as to whether a third party is an agent of the employer is whether the third party bears any insurance risk. If the third party bears no insurance risk and is reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is an agent of the employer even if the third party is responsible for making determinations of the eligibility of individual employees of the employer for payments on account of sickness or accident disability. If the third party is paid an insurance premium and not reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is not an agent of the employer, but the third party is treated as the employer as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e).

(4) In order to avoid overpayment of taxes which would result from paying taxes-

(i) On remuneration which exceeds the annual contribution and benefit base (as described in section 3121(a)(1)),

(ii) With respect to a period of time which exceeds the 6-calendar-month period described in section 3121(a)(4), or

(iii) On a payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee,

(5) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
