() A branch (as described in ยง 1.267A-5(a)(2)) the activities of which are carried on directly or indirectly (through one or more pass-through entities) by a controlled foreign corporation. However, in the case of a branch that does not give rise to a taxable presence under the tax law of the foreign country where the branch is located, the branch is a tested unit only if, under the tax law of the foreign country of which the controlled foreign corporation is a tax resident (or, if applicable, under the tax law of a foreign country of which the tested unit that directly (or indirectly, through the fewest number of transparent interests) carries on the activities of the branch is a tax resident), an exclusion, exemption, or other similar relief (such as a preferential rate) applies with respect to income attributable to the branch. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(A)(), similar relief does not include a credit (for example, a foreign tax credit) against the tax imposed under such tax law. If a controlled foreign corporation carries on directly or indirectly (through one or more pass-through entities) less than all of the activities of a branch (for example, if the activities are carried on indirectly through an interest in a partnership), then the rules in this paragraph apply separately with respect to the portion (or portions, if carried on indirectly through more than one chain of pass-through entities) of the activities carried on by the controlled foreign corporation. See paragraphs (c)(8)(iii)(D)() and (c)(8)(iii)(D)() (Example 4) of this section for illustrations of the application of the rules set forth in this paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(A)().
