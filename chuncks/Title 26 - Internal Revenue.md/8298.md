###### ยง 1.163(j)-6 Application of the section 163(j) limitation to partnerships and subchapter S corporations.
####### Partner-level allocations.

(iii)Because PRS is not subject to section 163(j), PRS's $40 of business interest expense does not retain its character as business interest expense for purposes of section 163(j). As a result, such business interest expense is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the partners' level. Pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-6(m)(1), the partners do not include their respective $50 shares of income from PRS when calculating their own ATI because such $50 is excepted trade or business income.
