####### Adjustment relating to retroactive beginning of lease term.

(B)If the lease term of a post-modification agreement begins before the date on which the modification occurs, the lessor and lessee must take into account in the taxable year in which the modification occurs any amount necessary to prevent the duplication or omission of rent or interest for the period after the beginning of the lease term of the post-modification agreement and before the beginning of the taxable year in which the modification occurs. For this purpose, the amount necessary to prevent duplication or omission is determined after taking into account any adjustments required by the Commissioner for taxable years ending prior to the beginning of the taxable year in which the modification occurs. In determining any adjustments required by the Commissioner for taxable years ending prior to the beginning of the taxable year in which the modification occurs, the Commissioner will disregard the modification.
