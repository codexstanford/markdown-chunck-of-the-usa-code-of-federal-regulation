The termmeans the sum of the Third-Party Price for a Covered Asset and the amount that an Agency or a Controlled Entity would pay under the Loss Guarantee if the asset actually were sold for the Third-Party Price. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if an asset is subject to a Loss Share Agreement, the amount that an Agency or a Controlled Entity would pay under a Loss Guarantee with respect to the asset is determined by multiplying the amount of loss that would be realized under the terms of the Loss Share Agreement if the asset were disposed of at the Third-Party Price by the Average Reimbursement Rate.
