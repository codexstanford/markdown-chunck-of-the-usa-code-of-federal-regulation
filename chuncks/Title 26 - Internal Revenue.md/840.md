####### Amount of apportionment to a constitutional home rule city.

(ii)The amount of the State housing credit ceiling apportioned to a constitutional home rule city for any calendar year is an amount that bears the same ratio to the State housing credit ceiling for that year as the population of the constitutional home rule city bears to the population of the entire State. The population of any constitutional home rule city for any calendar year is determined by reference to the most recent census estimate (whether final or provisional) of the resident population of the constitutional home rule city released by the Bureau of the Census before the beginning of the calendar year for which the State housing credit ceiling is apportioned. However, determinations of the population of a constitutional home rule city may not be based on Bureau of the Census estimates that do not contain estimates for all of the constitutional home rule cities within the State. If no Bureau of the Census estimate is available for all such constitutional home rule cities, the most recent decennial census of population shall be relied on. Unless otherwise prescribed by applicable revenue procedure, determinations of population for constitutional home rule cities are based on estimates of population contained in the Bureau of the Census publication, "Current Population Reports, Series P-26: Local Population Estimates".
