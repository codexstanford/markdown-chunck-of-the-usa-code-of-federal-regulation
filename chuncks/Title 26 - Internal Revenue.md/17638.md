() The condition of paragraph (k)(14)(iii) of this section is satisfied if UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement. Because after the complete liquidation of F1, UST wholly owns TFC, which wholly owns TFD, as was the case immediately after the initial transfer, UST is not required to describe, with the new gain recognition agreement, other dispositions or events that would constitute triggering events based on the principles of paragraph (j) of this section, other than the dispositions or events described in paragraph (j) of this section.
