####### Examples,Example 1. Paying agent that does not collect documentation.

(D)-(1)A fund, P, that is a participating FFI contracts with a U.S. person, A, to make payments to its account holders with respect to their equity interests in P. P contracts with another agent, B, to obtain documentation sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of such account holders. Based on the documentation it collects, B determines that none of P's account holders are subject to withholding. P provides a certification to A indicating that it has obtained documentation sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of P's account holders and that each payee is not subject to withholding under chapter 4. As the actions of B, as P's agent, are attributed to P, P may provide a certification to A indicating that it has determined the chapter 4 status of its payees, even if it is B, and not P, who made the determinations. However, P will be liable for any underwithholding that results from a failure by B to reasonably apply the rules under chapter 4. A is permitted to rely upon the certification provided by P and, accordingly, is not required to withhold on the payments made to P's account holders and would not be liable for any underwithholding that results if the determinations made by B are incorrect unless A had reason to know that chapter 4 status claimed was inaccurate.
