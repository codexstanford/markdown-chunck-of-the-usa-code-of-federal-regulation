####### Split-dollar life insurance.

(8)Remuneration resulting from a split-dollar life insurance arrangement (as defined in § 1.61-22(b)) under which an applicable individual has a legally binding right to economic benefits described in § 1.61-22(d)(2)(ii) (policy cash value to which the non-owner has current access within the meaning of § 1.61-22(d)(4)(ii)) or § 1.61-22(d)(2)(iii) (any other economic benefits provided to the non-owner) is attributable to services performed in the taxable year of the covered health insurance provider in which the legally binding right arises. Split-dollar life insurance arrangements under which payments are treated as split-dollar loans under § 1.7872-15 generally will not give rise to DDR within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11) of this section, although they may give rise to AIR. However, in certain situations, this type of arrangement may give rise to DDR for purposes of section 162(m)(6), for example, if amounts due on a split-dollar loan are waived, cancelled, or forgiven.
