####### Amortization of railroad rolling stock,In general.

(e)-(1)Section 57(a)(5) provides that, with respect to each unit of railroad rolling stock for which an election is in effect under section 184, there is to be included as an item of tax preference the amount by which the deduction allowable for the taxable year under such section exceeds the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under section 167. The determination under section 57(a)(5) is made with respect to each separate unit of rolling stock. Accordingly, where the amount of the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under section 167 with respect to one unit exceeds the allowable amortization deduction under section 184 with respect to such unit, such excess may not be used to offset an item of tax preference resulting from another unit.
