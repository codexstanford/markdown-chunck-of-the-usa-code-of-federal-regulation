####### Special rules.

(f)For purposes of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1954, and before January 1, 1958:

(1) The amount of any:

(i) Loss from operations;

(ii) Operations loss carryback; and

(iii) Operations loss carryover

(2) A loss from operations (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 812(b)(1)(C) and this paragraph) for such taxable years shall in no way affect the tax liability of any life insurance company for such taxable years. However, such loss may, to the extent allowed as an operations loss carryover under section 812, affect the tax liability of a life insurance company for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957. For example, for the taxable year 1956, X, a life insurance company, has a loss from operations (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 812(b)(1)(C) and this paragraph). Such loss shall in no way affect X's tax liability for the taxable years 1956 (the year of the loss), 1955 (a year to which such loss shall be carried back), or 1957 (a year to which such loss shall be carried forward). However, to the extent allowed under section 812, any amount of the loss for 1956 remaining after such carryback and carryforward shall be taken into account in determining X's tax liability for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
