######## In general.

(a)A partnership may elect under this section an alternative to the payment by the partnership of an imputed underpayment determined under section 6225. In addition, a partnership making a valid election under paragraph (c) of this section is no longer liable for the imputed underpayment (as defined in ยง 301.6241-1(a)(3)) to which the election applies. If a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) mailed under section 6231 includes more than one imputed underpayment (as described in ยง 301.6225-1(g)), a partnership may make an election under this section with respect to one or more imputed underpayments included in the FPA.
