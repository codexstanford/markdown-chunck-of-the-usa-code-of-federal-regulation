####### Example 5: Sale of goods with AFS revenue adjustments,Facts.

(v)-(A)In July 2021, F, a manufacturer of automobile parts, enters into a contract to sell 1,000 parts to a customer for $10 per part, for a total of $10,000 (1,000 x $10). The contract also provides that F will receive a $200 bonus if it delivers all the parts to the customer by February 1, 2022. F delivers 500 non-defective parts to the customer on December 31, 2021 and schedules the remaining 500 parts for delivery to the customer on January 1, 2022. F does not have an enforceable right to recover any portion of the $200 bonus if the customer were to terminate the contract before all 1,000 parts are delivered. F expects to earn the $200 bonus and have 5% of the non-defective parts returned. For its AFS, F reports $4,850 ($5,000 + $100-$250) of AFS revenue for 2021, which includes a $100 (50% x $200) adjustment to increase AFS revenue for the expected bonus and a $250 (5% x $5,000) adjustment to decrease AFS revenue for anticipated returns.
