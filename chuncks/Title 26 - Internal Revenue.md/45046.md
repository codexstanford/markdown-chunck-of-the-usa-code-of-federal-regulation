(ii) For purposes of netting cash contributions and distributions in determining the holding period of's interest inis treated as having received a distribution of $80 on November 1, 2000. Applying that distribution on a last-in-first-out basis to reduce prior contributions during the year, the contribution made on September 1, 2000, is reduced to $150 ($230-$80). The holding period then is determined as follows: Immediately after the contribution of $100 on January 2, 2000,'s holding period in'sinterest is 90 percent long-term ($900/($900 + $100)) and 10 percent short-term ($100/($900 + $100)). The contribution of $150 on September 1, 2000, causes 10 percent of's partnership interest ($150/($1,350 + $150)) to have a short-term holding period. Accordingly, immediately after the contribution on September 1, 2000,'s holding period in'sinterest is 81 percent long-term (.90 x .90) and 19 percent short-term ((.10 x .90) + .10). Accordingly, $486 ($600 x .81) of the gain from's sale of theinterest is long-term capital gain, and $114 ($600 x .19) is short-term capital gain.
