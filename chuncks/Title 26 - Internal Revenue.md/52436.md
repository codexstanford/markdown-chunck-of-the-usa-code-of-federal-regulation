####### B sells the Q stock in 2030.

(E)In 2030, B sells all its Q stock to X for $800x. Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, B is entitled to make the election under section 1400Z-2(c) if, treating S and B as a single entity, the single entity would be eligible to make the election. Taking into account S's holding period, B has held Q for over 10 years, and B is eligible for the election when it sells Q to X in 2030. B makes the section 1400Z-2(c) election at the time of sale. Following the election, if S and B were divisions of a single entity, the single entity's basis in Q would increase from $100x to its fair market value of $800x, causing to be excluded the $700x of gain on the sale of Q stock. To achieve this single entity result, ยง 1.1502-13(c)(1) redetermines B's $550x ($800x-$250x) of gain and S's deferred $150x of capital gain to be tax-exempt income. See paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section making ยง 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii) inapplicable in determining the excludability of S's intercompany gain. Therefore, as a result of the sale of the Q stock and B making the section 1400Z-2(c) election, S has $150x of tax-exempt income, and B has $550x of tax-exempt income.
