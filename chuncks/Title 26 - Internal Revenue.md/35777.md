####### Step 3: Determine the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss,In general.

(3)-(i)A foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss with respect to each asset is the amount of the deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that would have been allocated to the foreign transferor by the partnership under all applicable Internal Revenue Code sections (including section 704) upon the deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, taking into account allocations of tax items applying the principles of section 704(c), including any remedial allocations (see ยง 1.704-3(d)), and any section 743(b) basis adjustments (see ยง 1.743-1(j)(3)). For this purpose, a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss does not include any amount that is excluded from the foreign transferor's gross income or otherwise exempt from U.S. Federal income tax by reason of an applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code (including, for example, by reason of section 864(b)(2), 872(b), or 883). Similarly, a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss does not include any amount to which an exception under section 897 applies, such as section 897(k) or section 897(l), if that amount is not otherwise treated as effectively connected under a provision of the Code. For rules regarding the determination of a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss under an applicable U.S. income tax treaty, see paragraph (f) of this section.
