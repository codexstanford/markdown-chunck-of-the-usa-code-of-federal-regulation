####### Change in method of accounting

(2)-(i) If an insurance company did not take estimated salvage recoverable into account as required by paragraph (c) of this section for its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1990, taking estimated salvage recoverable into account as required by paragraph (c) of this section is a change in method of accounting.

(ii) If a company does not claim the deduction under section 11305(c)(3) of the 1990 Act, the company must take into account 13 percent of the adjustment that would otherwise be required under section 481 for pre-1990 accident years as a result of the change in accounting method. This paragraph (e)(2)(ii) applies only to an insurance company subject to tax under section 831.

(iii) If a company claims the deduction under section 11305(c)(3) of the 1990 Act and paragraph (f) of this section, the company must implement the change in method of accounting for estimated salvage recoverable for post-1989 taxable years pursuant to a "cut-off" method.
