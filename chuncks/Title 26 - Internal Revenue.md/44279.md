####### Amounts received on sale of purchaser's indebtedness.

(iv)Money or other property received by the seller on the sale of the purchaser's indebtedness that arose at the time of the sale of the real property are amounts received by the seller with respect to the sale of such real property, except that the amounts so received from the sale of such indebtedness shall be reduced by the amount of money and the fair market value of other property paid or transferred by the seller, before the reacquisition of the real property, to reacquire such indebtedness. For example, if S sells real property to P for $25,000, and under the contract receives $10,000 down and a note from P for $15,000, S would receive $22,000 with respect to the sale if he were to discount the note for $12,000. If before the reacquisition of the real property S were to reacquire the discounted note for $8,000, he would receive $14,000 with respect to the sale.
