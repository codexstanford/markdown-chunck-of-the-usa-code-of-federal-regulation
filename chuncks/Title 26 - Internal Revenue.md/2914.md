() Such useful life and such salvage value is to be determined by taking into account for each taxable year the same facts and circumstances as would have been taken into account if the taxpayer had used such method throughout the period the property was held.

(ii) Where the taxpayer acquires property in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies or from another member of an affiliated group during a consolidated return year and an "accelerated" method of depreciation as described in section 167(b) (2), (3), or (4) or section 167(j)(1) (B) or (C) is permitted (see § 1.381(c)(6)-1 and § 1.1502-12(g)), the depreciation which would have been allowable under the straight line method is determined as if the property had been depreciated under the straight line method since depreciation was first taken on the property by the transferor of such property. In such cases, references in this paragraph to the period for which the property is held or useful life of the property are treated as including the period beginning with the commencement of the original use of the property.

(iii) For purposes of section 57(a)(2), the straight line method includes the method of depreciation described in § 1.167(b)-1 or any other method which provides for a uniform proration of the cost or other basis (less salvage value) of the property over the estimated useful life of the property to the taxpayer (in terms of years, hours of use, or other similar time units) or estimated number of units to be produced over the life of the property to the taxpayer. If a method other than the method described in § 1.167(b)-1 is used, the estimated useful life or estimated units of production shall be determined in a manner consistent with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.

(iv) In the case of property constructed by or improvements made by a lessee, the useful life is to be determined in accordance with § 1.167(a)-4.
