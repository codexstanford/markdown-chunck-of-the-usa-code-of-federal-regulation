####### Basis of assets held for certain pension plan contracts.

(g)Section 801(g)(7) provides that in the case of contracts described in section 805(d)(1) (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) (relating to the definition of pension plan reserves), the basis of each asset in a segregated asset account shall (in addition to all other adjustments to basis) be (i) increased by the amount of any appreciation in value, and (ii) decreased by the amount of any depreciation in value; but only to the extent that such appreciation and depreciation are reflected in the increases and decreases in reserves, or other items described in section 801(g)(6), with respect to such contracts. Thus, there shall be no capital gains tax payable by a life insurance company on appreciation realized on assets in a segregated asset account to the extent such appreciation has been reflected in reserves, or other items described in section 801(g)(6), for contracts described in section 805(d)(1) (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) based on segregated asset accounts.
