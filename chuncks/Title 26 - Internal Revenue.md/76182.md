####### Improvement loan.

(7)The term "improvement loan" means a loan which, by its terms and conditions, requires that the proceeds of the loan be used for altering, repairing, or improving real property. If more than 85 percent of the proceeds of a single loan are to be used for such purposes, the entire loan will qualify. If 85 percent or less of the proceeds of a loan are to be used for such purposes, an allocation of its adjusted basis is required. Examples of loans which constitute improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of painting a house, adding a new room to a house, remodeling the lobby of an apartment building, and purchasing and installing storm windows, storm doors, and awnings. Examples of loans which do not constitute improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of purchasing draperies, and removable appliances, such as refrigerators, ranges, and washing machines. It is not necessary that a loan be secured by the real property which is altered, repaired, or improved.
