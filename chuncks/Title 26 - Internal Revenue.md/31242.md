####### Effect of allocation of undistributed net income on items based on amount of income and with respect to a net operating loss, a charitable contributions carryover, or a capital loss carryover.

(b)(1) In computing the tax for any taxable year under either the exact method or the short-cut method, any item which depends upon the amount of gross income, adjusted gross income, or taxable income shall be recomputed to take into consideration the amount of undistributed net income allocated to such year. For example, if $1,000 of undistributed net income is allocated to 1970, adjusted gross income for 1970 is increased from $5,000 to $6,000. The allowable 50 percent charitable deduction under section 170(b)(1)(A) is then increased and the amount of the nondeductible medical expenses under section 213 (3 percent of adjusted gross income) is also increased.

(2) In computing the tax attributable to the undistributed net income deemed distributed to the beneficiary in any of his prior taxable years under either the exact method or the short-cut method, the effect of amounts of undistributed net income on a net operating loss carryback or carryover, a charitable contributions carryover, or a capital loss carryback or carryover, shall be taken into account. In determining the amount of tax attributable to such deemed distribution, a computation shall also be made for any taxable year which is affected by a net operating loss carryback or carryover, by a charitable contributions carryover, or by a capital loss carryback or carryover determined by reference to the taxable year to which amounts are allocated under either method and which carryback or carryover is reduced or increased by such amounts so allocated. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:
