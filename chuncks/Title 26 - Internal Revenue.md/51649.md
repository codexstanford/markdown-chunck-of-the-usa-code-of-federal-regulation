Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d) (regarding securities held by foreign central banks of issue) and (f) (regarding retirement funds) of this section, a person must be a beneficial owner of a payment to be treated as an exempt beneficial owner with respect to the payment. The following classes of persons are exempt beneficial owners: any foreign government, any political subdivision of a foreign government, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing described in paragraph (b) of this section; any international organization or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality thereof described in paragraph (c) of this section; any foreign central bank of issue described in paragraph (d) of this section; any government of a U.S. territory described in paragraph (e) of this section; certain foreign retirement funds described in paragraph (f) of this section; and certain entities described in paragraph (g) of this section that are wholly owned by one or more other exempt beneficial owners. In addition, an exempt beneficial owner includes any person treated as an exempt beneficial owner pursuant to a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA. See §§ 1.1471-2(a)(4)(v) and 1.1472-1(c)(2) for the exemptions from withholding for payments beneficially owned by an exempt beneficial owner; § 1.1471-3(d)(9) for the documentation requirements applicable to a withholding agent for purposes of determining when a withholdable payment is beneficially owned by an exempt beneficial owner; and § 1.1471-3(d)(8)(ii) for when a withholding agent may treat a payment made to a nonparticipating FFI as beneficially owned by an exempt beneficial owner.
