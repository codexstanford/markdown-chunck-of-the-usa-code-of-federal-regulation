####### Acceleration of advance payments.,2,ii

(7)The acceleration rules in paragraph (c)(4) of this section also apply to a taxpayer that uses the advance payment cost offset method under this paragraph (e), regardless of whether the taxpayer uses such method in connection with the full inclusion method under paragraph (b) of this section, or the deferral method under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. If an advance payment is subject to the acceleration rules, paragraph (e)(2) of this section does not apply to determine the advance payment income inclusion amount for the taxable year described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Further, a taxpayer that uses the advance payment cost offset method under this paragraph (e) applies paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)()() of this section by substituting "same advance payment method as the transferor" for "deferral method."
