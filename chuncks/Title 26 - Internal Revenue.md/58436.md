(3)In the case of an application for an advance determination as to whether a plan amendment affects the continuing qualification of a plan, if:

(i) There is outstanding a favorable determination letter for a plan year to which section 410 applies, and

(ii) The amendment does not alter the participation provisions of the plan, then paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section shall not apply, and all present employees of the employer who are eligible to participate in the plan (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section), shall be interested parties. For the purpose of this paragraph (b)(3), if qualification of the plan is dependent upon benefits under the plan integrating with those benefits provided under the Social Security Act or a similar program, and if such integration results in excluding any employee or could possibly result in any participant's benefit being reduced to zero and the amendment alters contributions to or the amount of benefits payable under the plan, then the amendment shall be considered to alter the participation provisions of the plan.
