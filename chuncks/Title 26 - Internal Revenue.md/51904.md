####### Set-offs.

(4)Under the set-off procedure, the withholding agent may repay the beneficial owner or payee for an amount of overwithheld tax by applying the amount overwithheld against any amount which otherwise would be required under chapter 3 or 4 to be withheld from the amount paid by the withholding agent to such person before the earlier of the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing the Form 1042-S for the calendar year of overwithholding or the date that the Form 1042-S is actually filed with the IRS. For purposes of making a return on Form 1042 or 1042-S (or an amended form) for the calendar year of overwithholding and for purposes of making a deposit of the amount withheld, the reduced amount shall be considered the amount required to be withheld from such payment under chapter 3 or 4, respectively.
