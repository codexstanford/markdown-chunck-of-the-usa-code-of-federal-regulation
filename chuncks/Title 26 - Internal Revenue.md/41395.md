(5)A domestic corporation's proportionate share of eligible current year taxes of a controlled foreign corporation that are allocated and apportioned under § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) to a tested income group within a section 904 category of the controlled foreign corporation is the U.S. dollar amount of eligible current year taxes that are allocated and apportioned under § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) to a tested income group within a section 904 category of the controlled foreign corporation multiplied by a fraction (not to exceed one), the numerator of which is the portion of the tested income of the controlled foreign corporation in the tested income group within the section 904 category that is included in computing the domestic corporation's aggregate amount described in section 951A(c)(1)(A) and § 1.951A-1(c)(2)(i), and the denominator of which is the income in the tested income group within the section 904 category, both determined in the functional currency of the controlled foreign corporation. If the numerator or denominator of the fraction is zero or less than zero, the domestic corporation's proportionate share of the eligible current year taxes allocated and apportioned under § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) to the tested income group is zero.
