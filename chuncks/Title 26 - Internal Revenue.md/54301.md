(ii)Under § 1.1503(d)-3(e), because the losses of DRCare subject to Country X's mirror legislation, there is a deemed foreign use of DRC's year 1 dual consolidated loss. The stand-alone exception to the mirror rule in § 1.1503(d)-3(e)(2) does not apply because, absent the mirror legislation, DRC's year 1 dual consolidated loss would be available for a foreign use (as defined in § 1.1503(d)-3), without regard to whether such availability is limited by election or similar procedure. That is, absent the mirror legislation, all or a portion of the dual consolidated loss would be available to offset the income of FSunder the Country X consolidation regime. This is the case even if Country X did not recognize DRCas having a loss in year 1. Therefore, P may not make a domestic use election with respect to DRC's year 1 dual consolidated loss pursuant to § 1.1503(d)-3(d)(2).
