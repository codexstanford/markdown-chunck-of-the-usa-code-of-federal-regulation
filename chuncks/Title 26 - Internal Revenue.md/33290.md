(ii) The termmeans amounts returned or credited which are fixed by contract and do not depend on the experience of the company or the discretion of the management. Thus, such term includes amounts refunded due to policy cancellations or erroneously computed premiums. Furthermore, amounts of premiums or other consideration returned to another life insurance company in respect of reinsurance ceded shall be included in return premiums. For the treatment of amounts which do not meet the requirements of return premiums, see section 811 (relating to dividends to policyholders).
