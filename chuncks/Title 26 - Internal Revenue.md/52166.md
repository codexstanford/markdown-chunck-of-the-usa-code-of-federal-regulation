()The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(I)() of this section, and the partnership sells some of its depreciable assets to X at a gain on December 31 of Year 4. In addition to the intercompany gain taken into account as a result of the partnership's depreciation, S takes intercompany gain into account in Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's partnership items taken into account from the sale (which reflect the basis increase under section 743(b)) and the recomputed partnership items. The attributes of S's additional gain are redetermined to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation (recapture income or section 1231 gain).
