####### Analysis.,1

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), F is required to include $5,000, less the corresponding cost of goods sold under sections 263A and 471 as applicable, in gross income in 2021 as F has a fixed right to receive $5,000 from the delivery of 500 parts to the customer in 2021. However, F does not have a fixed right to receive any portion of the $200 delivery bonus as of the end of 2021 as the remaining 500 parts had yet to be delivered. Under the AFS income inclusion rule and, specifically, paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A)() and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the amount treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" for 2021 is also $5,000, calculated as $4,850 of AFS revenue that was reported for 2021, decreased by $100 for the expected delivery bonus that F does not have an enforceable right to recover if the customer were to terminate the contract as of the end of 2021 and increased by $250 for anticipated return liabilities that are accounted for under section 461 ($4,850-$100 + $250 = $5,000). Accordingly, F is required to include $5,000, less the corresponding cost of goods sold determined under sections 263A and 471 as applicable, in gross income in 2021.
