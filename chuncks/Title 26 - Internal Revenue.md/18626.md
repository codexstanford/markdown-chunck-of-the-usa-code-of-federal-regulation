The presumptions adopted by this paragraph (j)(2)(iii) shall not apply only if, and to the extent that, the loss corporation either has actual knowledge of facts to the contrary regarding its stock ownership and is thus subject to paragraph (k)(2) of this section, or is subject to paragraph (k)(4) of this section.

To the extent that the presumptions are rebutted, the public shareholders, public owners and 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders may be aggregated into additional public groups. For an exception applicable to certain regulated investment companies, see ยง 1.382-3(k)(1).
