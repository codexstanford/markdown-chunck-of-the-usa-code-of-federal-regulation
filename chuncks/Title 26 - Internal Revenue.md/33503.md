####### Adjustments required if accrual method of accounting was not used in 1957.

(b)The items of gross amount taken into account under section 809(c) and the items of deductions allowed under section 809(d) for the taxable year 1958 shall be determined as though the taxpayer had been on the accrual method of accounting prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section for all prior years. Thus, life insurance companies not on the accrual method for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957, those items of gross amount which would have been properly taken into account for the year 1957 if the company had been on the accrual method described in section 818(a). Likewise, life insurance companies not on the accrual method for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957, those items of deductions which would have been properly allowed for the year 1957 if the company had been on the accrual method described in section 818(a). For example, if certain premium amounts were received during the year 1958 but such amounts would have been properly taken into account for the year 1957 if the taxpayer had been on the accrual method for the year 1957, then the taxpayer will not be required to take such premium amounts into account for the year 1958. If, for example, certain claims, benefits, and losses were paid during the year 1958 but such items would have been properly taken into account for the year 1957 if the taxpayer had been on the accrual method for the year 1957, then the taxpayer will not be permitted to deduct such expense items for the year 1958. For a special transitional rule applicable with respect to changes in method of accounting required by section 818(a) and paragraph (a) of this section, see section 818(e) and ยง 1.818-6.
