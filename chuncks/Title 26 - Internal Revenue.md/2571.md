##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### ยง 1.50-1 Lessee's income inclusion following election of lessor of investment credit property to treat lessee as acquirer.
####### Example 1.

(1)X, a calendar year C corporation, leases nonresidential real property from Y. The property is placed in service on October 1, 2016. Y elects under ยง 1.48-4 to treat X as having acquired the property. X's investment credit determined under section 46 for 2016 with respect to such property is $9,750. The shortest recovery period that could be available to the property under section 168 is 39 years. Because Y has elected to treat X as having acquired the property, Y does not reduce its basis in the property under section 50(c). Instead, X, the lessee of the property, must include ratably in gross income over 39 years an amount equal to the credit determined under section 46 with respect to such property. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, X's increase in gross income for each of the 39 years beginning with 2016 is $250 ($9,750/39 year recovery period).
