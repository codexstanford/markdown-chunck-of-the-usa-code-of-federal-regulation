###### ยง 1.48-9 Definition of energy property.
####### Other section 48 rules apply.

(2)(i) In general, section 48(a) otherwise applies in determining if energy property is section 38 property. Thus, energy property excluded from the definition of section 38 property under section 48(a) (except by reason of section 48(a)(1) or (a)(3)) is not eligible for the energy credit. For example, energy property used predominantly outside the United States (section 48(a)(2)) or used by tax exempt organizations (section 48(a)(4)), in general, is not treated as section 38 property for any purpose and thus, is not eligible for the energy credit.

(ii) Other rules of section 48, such as those for leased property under section 48(d), also apply to energy property.
