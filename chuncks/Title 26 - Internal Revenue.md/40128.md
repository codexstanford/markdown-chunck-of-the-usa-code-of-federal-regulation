####### Calculation of tentative tested income item,In general.,2,iii,2,iv,2,iv

(iii)-(A)A tentative tested income item with respect to the tentative gross tested income item described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A) of this section is determined by allocating and apportioning deductions for the CFC inclusion year (including expense for current year taxes (as defined in § 1.960-1(b)(4)), and not including any items described in § 1.951A-2(c)(5) or (c)(6)) to the tentative gross tested income item under the principles of § 1.960-1(d)(3) and the rules of § 1.861-20. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7)(iii), each tentative gross tested income item (if any) is treated as assigned to a separate tested income group, as that term is described in § 1.960-1(d)(2)(ii)(C), and all other income is treated as assigned to a residual income group. For purposes of applying §§ 1.861-9 and 1.861-9T under the principles of § 1.960-1(d)(3), the amount of interest deductions that are allocated and apportioned to the assets (or gross income, in the case of a taxpayer that has elected the modified gross income method) of a lower-tier corporation, such as a corporation the stock of which is owned by the controlled foreign corporation indirectly through the tested unit, are allocated and apportioned to the residual income category and not to any tentative gross tested income item of the controlled foreign corporation. See paragraphs (c)(8)(iii)(A)()() (Example 1), (c)(8)(iii)(B)()() (Example 2), and (c)(8)(iii)(C)()() (Example 3) of this section for illustrations of the application of the rules set forth in this paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(A).
