A taxpayer not using the retail method may annually select an appropriate month for each dollar-value pool or make an election on Form 970, "Application to Use LIFO Inventory Method," to use a representative appropriate month (representative month). An election to use a representative month is a method of accounting and the month elected must be used for the taxable year of the election and all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's consent under ยง 1.446-1(e) to change or revoke its election.
