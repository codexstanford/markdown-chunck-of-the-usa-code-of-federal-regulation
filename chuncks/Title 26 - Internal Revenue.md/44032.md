() The common basis depreciation deductions (but not including remedial allocations of depreciation deductions under ยง 1.704-3(d)) that, under the terms of the partnership agreement effective for the taxable year in which the discharge of indebtedness occurs, are reasonably expected to be allocated to the partner over the property's remaining useful life. The assumptions made by a partnership in determining the reasonably expected allocation of depreciation deductions must be consistent for each partner. For example, a partnership may not treat the same depreciation deductions as being reasonably expected by more than one partner.
