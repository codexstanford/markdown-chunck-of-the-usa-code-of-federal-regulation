####### Premium allocation or apportionment.

(ii)Whether a premium can be allocated or apportioned on a reasonable basis to or between risks incurred when property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when such property is actually located outside the United States shall depend on the intention of the parties to the insurance contract, as determined from its provisions and the facts and circumstances preceding its execution. Contract provisions on the basis of which the premium reasonably may be so allocated or apportioned include, but are not limited to, provisions which separately describe each risk covered, the period of coverage of each risk, the special warranties for each risk, the premium for each risk (or the basis for determining such premium), and the conditions of paying the premium for each risk. For purposes of this subdivision, it shall be unnecessary formally to make a separate policy with respect to each risk covered or with respect to each clause attached to the policy, provided that the intention of the parties to the contract is reasonably clear. For example, if in the ordinary course of carrying on an insurance business an insurance policy is issued which covers fire, theft, and water damage risks incurred when property is actually located in the United States and marine risks incurred when such property is actually located outside the United States and which, pursuant to accepted insurance principles, properly describes the premium rates as percentages of the amount of coverage as ".825% plus .3% fire, etc. risks plus .12% water risks = 1.245%", a reasonable basis exists to allocate a $124.50 premium paid for $10,000 of such coverage to $82.50 for foreign risks and $42.00 ($30.00 + $12.00) to United States risks.
