####### Industrial or commercial process.

(3)(i) A process is a means or method of producing a desired result by chemical, physical, or mechanical action. For example, equipment installed in connection with retail sales, general office use, and residential use are not used in a process within the meaning of this paragraph (f)(3).

(ii) An industrial process includes agricultural processes and thermal processes relating to production or manufacture, such as those involving boilers and furnaces.

(iii) A commercial process includes laundering and food preparation.

(iv) More than one process may be conducted in a single facility. The fact that several processes involved in the production of a product are integrated does not cause such integrated processes to be treated as one process. For example, in a food canning facility, producing prepared food from fresh vegetables is not one process but rather an integration of several processes including washing, cooking and canning.

(v) The following example illustrates this paragraph (f)(3).
