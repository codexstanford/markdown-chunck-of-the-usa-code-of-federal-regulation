### Subchapter A - Income Tax

##### Special Rules for Determining Capital Gains and Losses
###### ยง 1.1252-1 General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of farm land.
####### Relation of section 1252 to other provisions,General.

(d)-(1)The provisions of section 1252 apply notwithstanding any other provisions of subtitle A of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or limitation under ยง 1.1252-2 applies, gain under section 1252(a)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1252 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section 1252(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm land will be treated as ordinary income and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is applicable. See example (1) of paragraph (e) of this section.
