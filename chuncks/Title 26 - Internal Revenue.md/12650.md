####### Time for adopting plan.

(2)An affiliated group may adopt an apportionment plan with respect to the matching taxable years of its members only if, at the time such plan is sought to be adopted, there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against any corporation the tax liability of which for any taxable year would be increased by the adoption of such plan. (If there is less than 1 year remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation will ordinarily, upon request, enter into an agreement to extend such statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.)
