###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Application of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule.

(iii)New T was a member of the Parent group when New T acquired Equipment #7 from an unrelated person. Because Old T, another member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #7 while a member of the group within the lookback period, New T would be treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #7 under the Group Prior Use Rule and New T's acquisition of Equipment #7 would not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. However, New T's acquisition of Equipment #7 satisfies the requirements of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, New T is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as transferring Equipment #7 to an unrelated person on June 2, 2019, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount and, immediately thereafter, acquiring deemed replacement property (New Equipment #7) from an unrelated person for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements in ยง 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, New T is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for an amount equal to the deemed sale amount for the taxable year in which it places New Equipment #7 in service.
