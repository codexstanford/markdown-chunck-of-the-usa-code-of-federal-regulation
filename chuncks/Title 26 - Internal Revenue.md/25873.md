####### Transfers to certain tax-exempt organizations.

(B)This paragraph (c)(3) does not apply to a disposition to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from tax imposed by chapter 1, subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (a tax-exempt entity) except to the extent the property is used in an activity the income from which is subject to tax under section 511(a) (a section 511(a) activity). However, if assets used to any extent in a section 511(a) activity are disposed of by the tax-exempt entity, then, notwithstanding any other provision of law (except section 1031 or section 1033) the recapture amount with respect to such disposition, to the extent attributable under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to the period of the transferor's ownership of the property prior to the first disposition, shall be included in the tax-exempt entity's unrelated business taxable income. To the extent that the tax-exempt entity ceases to use the property in a section 511(a) activity, the entity will be treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section as having disposed of the property to such extent on the date of the cessation.
