###### ยง 1.905-3 Adjustments to U.S. tax liability and to current earnings and profits as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
####### 2,Analysis.

()Because A is a cash basis taxpayer that claims the foreign tax credit in the year the taxes are paid, A's payment in Year 6 of 10u of additional tax owed with respect to Year 1 is not a foreign tax redetermination requiring a redetermination of U.S. tax liability under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Rather, A is eligible to claim the additional tax as a credit in Year 6, the year in which the tax is paid. Under ยง 1.986(a)-1(b), the 10u of tax is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment in Year 6 (10u at $1.10x:1u = $11x).
