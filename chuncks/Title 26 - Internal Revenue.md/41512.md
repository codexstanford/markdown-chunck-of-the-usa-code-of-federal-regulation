####### Treatment of United States tax as foreign tax.

(3)For the purpose solely of determining the effective foreign tax rate under this paragraph, if a foreign corporation has pretax earnings and profits attributable to income from sources within the United States for the taxable year upon which it pays United States income tax and if distributions from the earnings and profits of such corporation for such year to the electing United States shareholder with respect to stock to which the election to secure an exclusion under section 963 relates do not entitled such shareholder to the dividends-received deduction under section 245, the amount of the United States income tax shall be taken into account as though such tax were foreign income tax. The amount so treated as foreign income tax shall not exceed 90 percent of an amount determined by multiplying such pretax earnings and profits attributable to income from sources within the United States by a percentage which is the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate (determined without regard to the surtax exemption) prescribed by section 11 for the taxable year of the United States shareholder.
