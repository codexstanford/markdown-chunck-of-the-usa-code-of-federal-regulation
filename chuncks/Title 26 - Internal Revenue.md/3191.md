####### 3,Ordering of business interest expense incurred by a partnership and allocated to a corporate partner.,1,1,2,1

()For a corporate partner in a partnership that is allocated a business interest expense deduction under ยง 1.163(j)-6(f), the ordering rule provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)() of this section applies separately to the corporate partner's allocated business interest expense deduction from the partnership; that deduction is not comingled with the business interest expense deduction addressed in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)() or () of this section or the corporate partner's items from any other partnership. Similarly, when a corporate partner in a partnership is allocated excess business interest expense from a partnership under the rules set forth in ยง 1.163(j)-6(f) and the excess interest expense becomes deductible to the corporate partner, that partner applies the ordering rule provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)() of this section separately to that excess interest expense on a year-by-year basis. Corresponding adjustments to the classification of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are made consistent with this year-by-year and partnership-by-partnership approach.
