(ii)In year 2, under the laws of Country X, the $100x of year 1 loss, which includes the $80x dual consolidated loss attributable to P's Country X separate unit, is made available to offset income of HPS. Such income is attributable to P's interest in HPS, which is a separate unit. Such income also is income of FS, a foreign corporation that is an owner of an interest in HPS, which is not a separate unit. However, pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-3(c)(4), there is no foreign use of the year 1 dual consolidated loss in year 2. This is the case because P's interest in HPSas of the end of year 1 has not been reduced by more than a de minimis amount, and the portion of the $80x dual consolidated loss was made available for a foreign use in year 2 solely as a result of FS's ownership in HPSand the allocation or carry forward of the dual consolidated loss as a result of such ownership.
