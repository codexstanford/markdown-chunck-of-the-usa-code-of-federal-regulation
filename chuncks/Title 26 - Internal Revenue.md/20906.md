###### ยง 1.401(k)-3 Safe harbor requirements.
####### Safe harbor compensation defined.

(2)For purposes of this section, safe harbor compensation means compensation as defined in ยง 1.401(k)-6 (which incorporates the definition of compensation in ยง 1.414(s)-1); provided, however, that the rule in the last sentence of ยง 1.414(s)-1(d)(2)(iii) (which generally permits a definition of compensation to exclude all compensation in excess of a specified dollar amount) does not apply in determining the safe harbor compensation of NHCEs. Thus, for example, the plan may limit the period used to determine safe harbor compensation to the eligible employee's period of participation.
