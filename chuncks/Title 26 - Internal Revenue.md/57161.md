####### Partnership return required,In general.

(a)-(1)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a), a partnership shall make a separate return on Form 8308 with respect to each section 751(a) exchange (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) of an interest in such partnership which occurs after December 31, 1984. A partnership that is in doubt as to whether partnership property constitutes section 751 property to any extent or as to whether a transfer of a partnership interest constitutes a section 751(a) exchange may file Form 8308 in order to avoid the risk of incurring a penalty under section 6721. The penalty under section 6721 will generally apply, however, to partnerships that do not file Form 8308 where in fact a section 751(a) exchange occurred, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (e) of this section.
