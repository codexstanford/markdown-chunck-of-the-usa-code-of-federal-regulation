()The software licensed to FP is digital content as defined in ยง 1.250(b)-3(b)(1), and is downloaded by an end user as defined in ยง 1.250(b)-3(b)(2). Accordingly, because the software is downloaded solely onto computers outside the United States, DC's license to FP is for a foreign use and therefore a FDDEI sale under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. The entire $100x of the license fee is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.
