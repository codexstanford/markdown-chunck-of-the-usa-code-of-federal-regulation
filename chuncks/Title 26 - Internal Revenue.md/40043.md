####### 2,Analysis,i,Determination of pro rata share of tested income.

()-()For purposes of determining R Corp's pro rata share of FS's tested income under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of FS's allocable earnings and profits for purposes of the hypothetical distribution described in § 1.951-1(e)(1)(i) is $50x, the greater of its earnings and profits as determined under section 964 ($50x) or the sum of its subpart F income and tested income ($0 + $50x). Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 1.951-1(e)(1), FS's allocable earnings and profits of $50x are distributed in the hypothetical distribution pro rata to each share of stock. R Corp's pro rata share of FS's tested income for Year 1 is its pro rata share under section 951(a)(2)(A) and § 1.951-1(b)(1)(i) ($50x), reduced under section 951(a)(2)(B) and § 1.951-1(b)(1)(ii) by $20x, which is the lesser of $20x, the dividend received by P Corp during Year 1 with respect to the FS stock acquired by R Corp ($20x), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the tested income ($50x) of FS for Year 1 and the denominator of which is the sum of the subpart F income ($0) and the tested income ($50x) of FS for Year 1 ($20x x $50x/$50x), and $20x, which is P Corp's pro rata share (100%) of the amount which bears the same ratio to FS's tested income for Year 1 ($50x) as the period during which R Corp did not own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) the FS stock (146 days) bears to the entire taxable year (1 x $50x x 146/365). Accordingly, R Corp's pro rata share of tested income of FS for Year 1 is $30x ($50x - $20x).
