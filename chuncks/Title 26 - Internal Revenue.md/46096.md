####### Disposition of an undivided interest,Natural resource recapture property subject to the general rules of ยง 1.1254-1.

(2)-(i)For purposes of section 1254(a)(1), except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section, in the case of the disposition of an undivided interest in natural resource recapture property (or a portion thereof), a proportionate part of the section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property is treated as allocable to the transferred undivided interest to the extent of the amount of gain to which section 1254(a)(1) applies. For example, assume that A owns an 80-acre tract of land with respect to which A has deducted intangible drilling and development costs under section 263(c). If A sells an undivided 40 percent interest in the 80-acre tract, 40 percent of the section 1254 costs with respect to the 80-acre tract is allocable to the transferred 40 percent interest in the 80-acre tract. However, if the amount of gain recognized on the sale of the 40 percent undivided interest were equal to only 35 percent of the amount of section 1254 costs attributable to the 80-acre tract, only 35 percent of the section 1254 costs would be treated as attributable to the undivided 40 percent interest. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section for an alternative allocation rule.
