###### ยง 1.668(b)-2A Special rules applicable to section 668.
####### Multiple distributions in the same taxable year.

(c)For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, accumulation distributions made from more than one trust in the same taxable year of the beneficiary, regardless of when in the taxable year they were actually made, shall be treated as having been made consecutively, in whichever order the beneficiary may determine. However, the beneficiary must treat them as having been made in the same order for the purpose of computing the partial tax on the several accumulation distributions. The beneficiary shall indicate the order he has determined to deem the accumulation distributions to have been received by him on his return for the taxable year. A failure by him so to indicate, however, shall not affect his right to make such determination. The purpose of this rule is to assure that the tax resulting from the later (as so deemed under this paragraph) distribution is computed with the inclusion of the earlier distribution in the taxable base and that the tax resulting from the earlier (as so deemed under this paragraph) distribution is computed with the later distribution excluded from the taxable base.
