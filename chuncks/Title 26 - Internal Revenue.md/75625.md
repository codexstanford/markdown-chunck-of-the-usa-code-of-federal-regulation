######## General creditors.

(b)While the immunity from tax collection is for protection of depositors, and not for benefit of general creditors, in some cases the immunity will not end until the assets are sufficient to cover indebtedness of creditors generally. This situation will exist where under applicable law the claims of general creditors are on a parity with those of depositors, so that to pay depositors in full it is necessary to pay all creditors in full.
