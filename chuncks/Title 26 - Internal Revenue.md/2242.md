####### Example 4: Coordination with section 50(d)(5) and ยง 1.50-1; C corporation lessee.

(4)X, a calendar year C corporation, leases nonresidential real property from Y. The property is a qualified rehabilitated building that is placed in service on October 15, 2021. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined is $100,000. Y elects under ยง 1.48-4 to treat X as having acquired the property. The shortest recovery period that could be available to the property under section 168 is 39 years. Because Y has elected to treat X as having acquired the property, Y does not reduce its basis in the property under section 50(c). Instead, pursuant to section 50(d)(5) and ยง 1.50-1, X, the lessee of the property, must include ratably in gross income over 39 years an amount equal to the rehabilitation credit determined with respect to such property.
