()The transfer of old T's assets to new T qualifies under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B)() of this section only if B has entered into a written plan, on or before the due date of the group's consolidated income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year that includes the date of old T's liquidation, to transfer the old T assets to new T, and the statement described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(E) of this section is included on or with a timely filed consolidated income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year that includes the date of the liquidation. However, in the case of a liquidation of old T on or after October 25, 2007, by a taxpayer whose original tax return for the year of liquidation was filed on or before November 3, 2009, see ยง 1.1502-13T(f)(5)(ii)(F)() as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2012. In either case, the transfer of substantially all of T's assets to new T must be completed within 12 months of the filing of the return. Appropriate adjustments are made to reflect any events occurring before the formation of new T and to reflect any assets not transferred to new T, or liabilities not assumed by new T. For example, if B retains an asset of old T, the asset is treated under paragraph (f)(3) of this section as acquired by new T but distributed to B immediately after the reorganization.
