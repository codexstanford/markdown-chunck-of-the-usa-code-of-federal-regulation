(ii)A corporation making an election under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section must treat the taxable year as separate taxable years for purposes of allocating items of income and loss; making adjustments to the AAA, earnings and profits, and basis; and determining the tax effect of distributions under section 1368 (b) and (c). An election made under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section may be made upon the occurrence of any qualifying disposition. Dispositions of stock that are taken into account as part of a qualifying disposition are not taken into account in determining whether a subsequent qualifying disposition has been made. In the case of a taxable year for which an election is made under paragraph (g)(2)(i), for purposes of section 163(j), a separate section 163(j) limitation (as defined in ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(36)) applies to each separate taxable year. Any items necessary to determine the amount of business interest expense (as defined in ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(3)) that are deducted in each separate taxable year must be allocated between the two separate taxable years in accordance with an allocation methodology provided in this paragraph (g).
