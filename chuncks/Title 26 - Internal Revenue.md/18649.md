###### ยง 1.382-2T Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary).
####### Stock subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(i)With respect to loss corporation stock that is described in Rule 13d-1(d) of Regulation 13D-G (or any rule or regulation to generally the same effect), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 ("registered stock"), a loss corporation may rely on the existence and absence of filings of Schedules 13D and 13G (or any similar schedules) as of any date to identify all of the corporation's shareholders who have a direct ownership interest of five percent or more (both individuals and first tier entities) on such date. A loss corporation may similarly rely on the existence and absence of such filings as of any date with respect to registered stock of any first tier entity or any higher tier entity to identify the 5-percent owners of any such entities on such date who indirectly own five percent or more of the loss corporation stock, and are thus 5-percent shareholders, and to identify any higher tier entities of such entities.
