(4)Contributions made to a disqualified fund after the date of disqualification are not deductible under section 468A(a) and ยง 1.468A-2(a), or, if the fund is disqualified only in part, are deductible only to the extent provided in the notice of disqualification. In addition, if any assets of the fund that are deemed distributed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section are held by the fund after the date of disqualification (or if additional assets are acquired with nondeductible contributions made to the fund after the date of disqualification), the income earned by such assets after the date of disqualification must be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer (section 671) to the extent that such income is otherwise includible under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). An electing taxpayer can establish a nuclear decommissioning fund to replace a fund that has been disqualified in its entirety only if the IRS specifically consents to the establishment of a replacement fund in connection with the issuance of an initial schedule of ruling amounts for such replacement fund.
