####### Separate tickets.

(c)Where a separate ticket or order is issued for taxable transportation as defined in section 4262 (a) (1) (referred to in this subpart as the "domestic ticket or order"), but the domestic ticket or order is to be used in conjunction with a ticket or order for additional transportation (referred to in this subpart as the "international ticket or order") which changes the tax consequences, unless the domestic ticket or order and the international ticket or order are purchased from a single agency or carrier at the same time, the person making payment for the domestic ticket or order shall at the time of payment exhibit the international ticket or order to the agency or carrier receiving such payment. The agency or carrier which receives the payment for the domestic ticket or order shall inscribe the tickets or orders for the entire journey in the following manner:

(1) The international ticket or order shall be inscribed or stamped with an appropriate legend (for example, "Cannot be reused to obtain any tax exemption on a domestic ticket or order") to show that a domestic ticket or order has been purchased wholly or partially tax free for use in conjunction therewith.

(2) The domestic ticket or order shall be inscribed to show (i) the identity of the agency or carrier which received payment therefor (unless otherwise shown on the ticket or order), (ii) the origin and destination of the additional transportation, (iii) the identify of the carrier furnishing the additional transportation, and (iv) the serial number of the ticket or order covering such additional transportation. If the domestic ticket or order is not large enough to accommodate the prescribed inscription, a statement setting forth the required information shall be attached to such ticket or order.
