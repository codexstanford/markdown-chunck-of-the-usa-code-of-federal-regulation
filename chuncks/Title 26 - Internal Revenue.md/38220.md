(B)-()The gross receipts from the sale of portable electronic devices ($1,750x), which results in U.S. source gross income of $450x, is recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles). Therefore, the gross income ($450x) generally would be foreign branch category income under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of gross income attributable to FDE (and the gross income attributable to P) is adjusted to take the disregarded payment for the portable electronic devices from FDE to P into account. If both FDE and the disregarded payment from FDE to P were recognized for Federal income tax purposes, the amount of the payment ($1,500x) would reduce FDE's gross income. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)()() of this section, the principles of paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)()() of this section apply for purposes of determining whether, and to what extent, the disregarded payment is allocable to non-passive category income attributable to FDE for purposes of determining the extent of any adjustment.
