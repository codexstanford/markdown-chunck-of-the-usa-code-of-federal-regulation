## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### ยง 1.46-8 Requirements for taxpayers electing additional one-percent investment credit (TRASOP's).
####### TRASOP qualification under section 401(a),Permanence.

(8)-(i)A TRASOP is not required to be a qualified plan under section 401(a). However, to meet the requirements of section 401(a), a TRASOP must be a permanent plan, as described in ยง 1.401-1(b)(2) of this chapter. Under section 401(a)(21), a plan will not fail to be considered permanent merely because the amount of employer contributions under the plan is determined solely by reference to the amount of additional credit allowable under this section. Thus, for example, it will not fail to be considered permanent merely because employer contributions are not made for a year for which an additional credit is not available by reason of no qualified investment for which an additional credit can be obtained. Section 401(a)(21) applies only to the extent the TRASOP is funded with TRASOP securities and cash in lieu of TRASOP securities.
