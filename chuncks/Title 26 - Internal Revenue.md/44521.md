####### Applicable Partnership Interest (API)

means any interest in a partnership which, directly or indirectly, is transferred to (or is held by) an Owner Taxpayer or Passthrough Taxpayer in connection with the performance of substantial services by the Owner Taxpayer or by a Passthrough Taxpayer, or by any Related Person, including services performed as an employee, in any ATB unless an exception in ยง 1.1061-3 applies. For purposes of defining an API under this section and section 1061 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), an interest in a partnership also includes any financial instrument or contract, the value of which is determined in whole or in part by reference to the partnership (including the amount of partnership distributions, the value of partnership assets, or the results of partnership operations). An Owner Taxpayer and a Passthrough Taxpayer can hold an API directly or indirectly through one or more Passthrough Entities.
