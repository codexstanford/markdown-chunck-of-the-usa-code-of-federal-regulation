(4)The distribution of an undivided interest in property is treated as the distribution of previously contributed property to the extent that the undivided interest does not exceed the undivided interest, if any, contributed by the distributee partner in the same property. See ยง 1.704-4(c)(6) for the application of section 704(c)(1)(B) in a similar context.
