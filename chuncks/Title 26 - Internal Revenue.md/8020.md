####### Example 1,Facts.

(i)-(A)Individual A operates an excepted trade or business (Business X) and a non-excepted trade or business (Business Y). With a principal purpose of avoiding the rules of section 163(j) or the regulations in this part under section 163(j) of the Code, A contributes Business X to newly-formed C corporation B in exchange for stock; A then causes B to borrow funds from a third party and distributes a portion of the borrowed funds to A for use in Business Y. B takes the position that its interest payments on the debt are not subject to the section 163(j) limitation because B is engaged solely in an excepted trade or business.
