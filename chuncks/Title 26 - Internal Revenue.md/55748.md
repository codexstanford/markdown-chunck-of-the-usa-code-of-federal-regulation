###### ยง 1.6038A-3 Record maintenance.
####### Required U.S. maintenance.

(5)The District Director (with the concurrence of the Assistant Commissioner (International)), may require, for cause, the maintenance within the United States of any records specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Such a requirement will be imposed only if there exists a clear pattern of failure to maintain or timely produce the required records. The assessment of a monetary penalty under section 6038A(d) and ยง 1.6038A-4 for failure to maintain records is not necessarily sufficient to require the maintenance of records within the United States.
