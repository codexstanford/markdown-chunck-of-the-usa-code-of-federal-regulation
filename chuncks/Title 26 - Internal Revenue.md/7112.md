###### ยง 1.162-31 The $500,000 deduction limitation for remuneration provided by certain health insurance providers.
####### Application of the deduction limitation,Application to aggregate amounts.

(e)-(1)The $500,000 deduction limitation is applied to the aggregate amount of AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year. The aggregate amount of AIR and DDR attributable to services performed by an applicable individual in a disqualified taxable year that exceeds the $500,000 deduction limit is not allowed as a deduction in any taxable year. Therefore, for example, if an applicable individual has more than $500,000 of AIR attributable to services performed for a covered health insurance provider in a disqualified taxable year, the amount of that AIR that exceeds $500,000 is not deductible in any taxable year, and no DDR attributable to services performed by the applicable individual in that disqualified taxable year is deductible in any taxable year. However, if an applicable individual has AIR for a disqualified taxable year that is $500,000 or less and DDR attributable to services performed in the same disqualified taxable year that, when combined with the AIR for the year, exceeds $500,000, all of the AIR is deductible in that disqualified taxable year, but the amount of DDR attributable to that taxable year that is deductible in future taxable years is limited to an amount equal to $500,000 less the amount of the AIR for that taxable year.
