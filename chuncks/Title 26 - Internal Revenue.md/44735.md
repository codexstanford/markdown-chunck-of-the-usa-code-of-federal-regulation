(b)(1) Under section 5 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79e), any holding company may register by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission a notification of registration, in such form as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers. A holding company shall be deemed to be registered upon receipt by the Securities and Exchange Commission of such notification of registration. As used in this part, the termmeans a holding company whose notification of registration has been so received and whose registration is still in effect under section 5 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Under section 2 (a)(7) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79b (a)(7)), a corporation is a holding company (unless it is declared not to be such by the Securities and Exchange Commission), if such corporation directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with power to vote 10 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of a public-utility company (i.e., an electric utility company or a gas utility company as defined by such act) or of any other holding company. A corporation is also a holding company if the Securities and Exchange Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such corporation directly or indirectly exercises (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons) such a controlling influence over the management or policies of any public-utility company (i.e., an electric utility company or a gas utility company as defined by such act) or holding company as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such corporation be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed upon holding companies by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. ch. 2C). An electric utility company is defined by section 2 (a)(3) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79b (a)(3)) to mean a company which owns or operates facilities used for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electrical energy for sale, other than sale to tenants or employees of the company operating such facilities for their own use and not for resale; and a gas utility company is defined by section 2 (a)(4) of such act (15 U.S.C. 79b (a)(4)), to mean a company which owns or operates facilities used for the distribution at retail (other than distribution only in enclosed portable containers, or distribution to tenants or employees of the company operating such facilities for their own use and not for resale) of natural or manufactured gas for heat, light, or power. However, under certain conditions the Securities and Exchange Commission may declare a company not to be an electric utility company or a gas utility company, as the case may be, in which event the company shall not be considered an electric utility company or a gas utility company.
