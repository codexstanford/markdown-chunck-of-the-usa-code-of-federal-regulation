###### § 1.1474-1 Liability for withheld tax and withholding agent reporting.
####### Exception to reporting.

(ii)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), a chapter 4 reportable amount does not include an amount paid to a U.S. person if the withholding agent treats such U.S. person as a payee for purposes of determining whether withholding is required under §§ 1.1471-2 and 1.1472-1. A chapter 4 reportable amount does, however, include an amount paid to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI to the extent allocable to its reporting pool of payees that are U.S. persons as described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
