####### CFC1,Step 1.,1,i

(ii)-(A)Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, CFC1's items of gross income for the current taxable year are assigned to section 904 categories and included in income groups within those section 904 categories. In addition, CFC1's receipt of a section 959(b) distribution is assigned to a PTEP group. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and § 1.904-4, the interest income is passive category income and the foreign oil and gas extraction income is general category income. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the 2,000,000u of interest income is assigned to a subpart F income group (the "subpart F income group") within the passive category because it is foreign personal holding company income described in § 1.954-1(c)(1)(iii)(A)()() that falls within a single group of income under § 1.904-4(c)(3)(iii) for passive income that is subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax. The 2,000,000u of foreign oil and gas extraction income is assigned to the residual income group within the general category. Under § 1.960-3(c), the 4,000,000u section 959(b) distribution is assigned to the PTEP group described in § 1.960-3(c)(2)(vii) within the 2017 annual PTEP account (the "PTEP group") within the general category.
