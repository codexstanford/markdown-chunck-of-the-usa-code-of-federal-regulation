####### ยง 301.6231(a)(6)-1 Computational adjustments.
######## Affected items that require partner-level determinations.

(3)Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that require partner-level determinations (such as a partner's at-risk amount to the extent it depends upon the source from which the partner obtained the funds that the partner contributed to the partnership) are computational adjustments that are subject to the deficiency procedures. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item is not subject to the deficiency procedures, but rather may be directly assessed as part of the computational adjustment that is made following the partnership proceeding, based on determinations in that proceeding, regardless of whether any partner-level determinations may be required.
