####### Treatment of deductions and losses.

(B)For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of partnership items, deductions and losses are treated as negative income. Thus, for example, if under section 702(a) a partnership has $1,000 of ordinary taxable income, $500 of specially allocated deductions, and $300 of capital loss, the net income of the partnership is $200 ($1,000-$500-$300).
