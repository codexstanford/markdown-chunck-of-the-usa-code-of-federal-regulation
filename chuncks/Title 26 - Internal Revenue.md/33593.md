####### Protection against loss account.

(a)Section 826(d) provides that for purposes of determining the amount to be subtracted from the protection against loss account under section 824(d)(1)(D) and the regulations thereunder (relating to amounts added to the account for the fifth preceding taxable year) for any taxable year, any amount which was added to such account by reason of the election under section 826(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.826-1 shall be treated as having been added by reason of section 824(a)(1)(A) and the regulations thereunder (relating to amounts equal to 1 percent of losses incurred during the taxable year). Thus, no amount added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election made under section 826(a) may remain in such account beyond the end of the fifth taxable year following the taxable year with respect to which such amount was added. See section 824(d)(1)(D) and paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.824-1. The amount added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election under section 826(a) is that amount which is equal to 25 percent (plus, in the case of a reciprocal which qualifies as a concentrated risk company under section 824(a), so much of the concentrated wind-storm, etc., premium percentage as exceeds 40 percent) of the amount by which:

(1) The underwriting gain (as defined by section 824(a)(1)) computed after taking into account the limitation provided by section 826(b) and § 1.826-1, exceeds

(2) The underwriting gain computed without regard to the limitation provided by section 826(b) and § 1.826-1.
