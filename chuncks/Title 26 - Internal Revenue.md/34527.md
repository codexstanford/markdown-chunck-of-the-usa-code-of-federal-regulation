####### Certain stock and dividends.,exempt income

(B)The termincludes the portion of the dividends that are deductible under section 243(a)(1) or (2) (relating to the dividends received deduction) or section 245(a) (relating to the dividends received deduction for dividends from certain foreign corporations). Thus, for purposes of apportioning deductions using a gross income method, gross income does not include a dividend to the extent that it gives rise to a dividends-received deduction under either section 243(a)(1), section 243(a)(2), or section 245(a). In addition, for purposes of apportioning deductions using an asset method, assets do not include that portion of the value of the stock (determined in accordance with § 1.861-9(g), and, as relevant, §§ 1.861-12 and 1.861-13) equal to the portion of dividends that would be offset by a deduction under either section 243(a)(1), section 243(a)(2), or section 245(a), to the extent the stock generates, has generated, or can reasonably be expected to generate such dividends. For example, in the case of stock for which all dividends would be allowed a deduction of 50 percent under section 243(a)(1), 50 percent of the value of the stock is treated as an exempt asset. In the case of stock which generates, has generated, or can reasonably be expected to generate qualifying dividends deductible under section 243(a)(3), such stock does not constitute an exempt asset. However, such stock and the qualifying dividends thereon are eliminated from consideration in the apportionment of interest expense under the affiliated group rule set forth in § 1.861-11T(c), and in the apportionment of other expenses under the affiliated group rules set forth in § 1.861-14T.
