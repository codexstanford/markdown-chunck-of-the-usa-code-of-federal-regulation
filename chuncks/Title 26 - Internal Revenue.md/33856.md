####### Subsection (d) gain for certain taxable years.

(3)In the case of capital gain dividends with respect to any taxable year of a regulated investment company ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975 (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year pursuant to an election under section 855), the company must include in its written notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section a statement showing the shareholder's proportionate share of the capital gain dividend which is gain described in section 1201(d)(1) and his proportionate share of such dividend which is gain described in section 1201(d)(2). In determining the portion of the capital gain dividend which, in the hands of a shareholder, is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), the regulated investment company shall consider that capital gain dividends for a taxable year are first made from its long-term capital gains for such year which are not described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), to the extent thereof, and then from its long-term capital gains for such year which are described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). A shareholder's proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount paid to him as a capital gain dividend in respect of such year as (i) the aggregate amount of the company's gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) and paid to all shareholders bears to (ii) the aggregate amount of the capital gain dividend paid to all shareholders in respect of such year. A shareholder's proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(2) shall be determined in a similar manner. Every regulated investment company shall keep a record of the proportion of each capital gain dividend (to which this paragraph applies) which is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). If, for his taxable year, a shareholder must include in his gross income a capital gain dividend to which this paragraph applies, he shall attach to his income tax return for such taxable year a statement showing, with respect to the total of such dividends for such taxable year received from each regulated investment company, the name and address of the regulated investment company from which such dividends are received, the amount of such dividends, the portion of such dividends which was designated as gain described in section 1201(d)(1), and the portion of such dividends which was designated as gain described in section 1201(d)(2).
