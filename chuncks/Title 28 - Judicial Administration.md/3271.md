All commenters addressing this issue agreed with the Department's proposal and supported the use of the term and the Department's definition. In the final rule, the Department has retained the term "audio description," and has slightly modified the definition for clarity to read as follows: "means the spoken narration of a movie's key visual elements, such as the action, settings, facial expressions, costumes, and scene changes.generally requires the use of an audio description device for delivery to a patron."

In the NPRM, at proposed ยง 36.303(g)(1)(iii), the Department used the term "individual audio description listening device" to refer to the "individual device that patrons may use at their seats to hear audio description." The sole commenter on this definition expressed concern that the term "individual audio description listening device" was unnecessarily long. The Department agrees with the commenter and has revised the name of the device accordingly in the final rule. The final rule retains the text of the proposed definition with minor edits.

In the NPRM, at proposed ยง 36.303(g)(1)(iv), the Department used the term "individual captioning device" to refer to the "individual device that patrons may use at their seats to view the closed captions." The sole commenter on this definition recommended that the Department shorten the nomenclature for this device to "captioning device." The Department agrees with the commenter and has revised the name of the device accordingly in the final rule. The final rule retains the text of the proposed definition with minor edits.
