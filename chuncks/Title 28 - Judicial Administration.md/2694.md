Proposed §§ 35.108(d)(3) and 36.105(d)(3), both titled "Condition, manner[,] and duration," addressed how evidence related to condition, manner, or duration may be used to show how impairments substantially limit major life activities. These principles were first addressed in the preamble to the 1991 rule. At that time, the Department noted that "[a] person is considered an individual with a disability . . . when the individual's important life activities are restricted as to the conditions, manner, or duration under which they can be performed in comparison to most people." 56 FR 35544, 35549 (July 26, 1991);S.
