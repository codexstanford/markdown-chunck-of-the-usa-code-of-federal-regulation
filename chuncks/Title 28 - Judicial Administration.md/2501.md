The 1991 title II regulation provided definitions for "new construction" at ยง 35.151(a) and "alterations" at ยง 35.151(b). In contrast, the term "existing facility" was not explicitly defined, although it is used in the statute and regulations for title II.42 U.S.C. 12134(b); 28 CFR 35.150. It has been the Department's view that newly constructed or altered facilities are also existing facilities with continuing program access obligations, and that view is made explicit in this rule.
