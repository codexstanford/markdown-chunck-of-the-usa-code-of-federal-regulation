### PART 72 - SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION
#### ยง 72.7 How sex offenders must register and keep the registration current.
##### Example 3 to paragraph (g)(1).

A sex offender registers as required when released from imprisonment or upon entering a jurisdiction to reside, but the jurisdiction has no procedure for sex offenders to appear periodically in person to update and verify the registration information as required by 34 U.S.C. 20918 and paragraph (b) of this section. The jurisdiction later sends the sex offender a notice advising that it has adopted a periodic verification requirement and directing the sex offender to appear at a designated time and place for an initial update meeting. The sex offender must appear and update the registration as directed.
