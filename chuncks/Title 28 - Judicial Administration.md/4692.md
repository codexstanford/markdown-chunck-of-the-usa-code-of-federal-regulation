#### ยง 68.53 Review of an interlocutory order of an Administrative Law Judge in cases arising under section 274A or 274C.
##### Authority.

(a)In a case arising under section 274A or 274C of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer may, within thirty (30) days of the date of an Administrative Law Judge's interlocutory order, issue an order that modifies or vacates the interlocutory order. The Chief Administrative Hearing Officer may review an Administrative Law Judge's interlocutory order if:

(1) An Administrative Law Judge, when issuing an interlocutory order, states in writing that the Judge believes:

(i) That the order concerns an important question of law on which there is a substantial difference of opinion; and

(ii) That an immediate appeal will advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or that subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy; or

(2) Within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of an interlocutory order a party requests by motion that the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer review the interlocutory order. This motion shall contain a clear statement of why interlocutory review is appropriate under the standards set out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

(3) Within ten (10) days of the entry of the interlocutory order, the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer, upon the Officer's own initiative, determines that such order is appropriate for interlocutory review pursuant to the standards set out in paragraph (a)(1) and issues a notification of review. This notification shall state the issues to be reviewed.
