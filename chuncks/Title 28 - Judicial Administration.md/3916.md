### PART 50 - STATEMENTS OF POLICY
#### ยง 50.20 Participation by the United States in court-annexed arbitration.
##### Objection to the imposition of penalties or sanctions against the United States for demanding trial de novo.

(c)(1) Under the principle of sovereign immunity, the United States cannot be held liable for costs or sanctions in litigation in the absence of a statutory provision waiving its immunity. In view of the statutory limitations on the costs payable by the United States (28 U.S.C. 2412(a), 2412(b), and 1920), the Department does not consent to provisions in any district's arbitration program providing for the United States or the Department, agency, or official named as a party to the action to pay any sanction for demanding a trial de novo-either as a deposit in advance or as a penalty imposed after the fact-which is based on the arbitrators' fees, the opposing party's attorneys' fees, or any other costs not authorized by statute to be awarded against the United States. This objection applies whether the penalty or sanction is required to be paid to the opposing party, to the clerk of the court, or to the Treasury of the United States.

(2) In any case involving the United States that is designated for arbitration under a program pursuant to which such a penalty or sanction might be imposed against the United States, its officers or agents, the attorney for the government is instructed to take appropriate steps, by motion, notice of objection, or otherwise, to apprise the court of the objection of the United States to the imposition of such a penalty or sanction.

(3) Should such a penalty or sanction actually be required of or imposed on the United States, its officers or agents, the attorney for the government is instructed to:

(i) Advise the appropriate Assistant Attorney General of this development promptly in writing;

(ii) Seek appropriate relief from the district court; and

(iii) If necessary, seek authority for filing an appeal or petition for mandamus.
