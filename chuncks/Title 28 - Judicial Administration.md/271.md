###### Closing or Dismissal of Matters and Cases.

4.Subject to the limitations imposed in Paragraph D of this section, a direct referral matter described in Section I may be closed without action by the United States Attorney or, if filed in court, may be dismissed by him, if the field officer of the interested agency concurs in writing that it is without merit legally or factually. Except for claims on behalf of Indians or Indian tribes, the United States Attorney may close a claim without consulting the field officer of the interested agency if the claim is for money only and if he concludes (a) that the cost of collection under the circumstances would exceed the amount of the claim, or (b) that the claim is uncollectible. With respect to claims asserted by the United States on behalf of individual Indians or Indian tribes, the United States Attorney may close a claim without consulting the field officer of the interested agency if the claim is for money only and if he concludes that the claim is uncollectible; claims on behalf of Indian individuals and tribes may not be closed merely because the cost of collection might exceed the amount of the claim.
