##### Program requirements.,Pennsylvania Department of Corrections,Yeskey,

In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court, inv.524 U.S. 206 (1998), stated explicitly that the ADA covers the operations of State prisons; accordingly, title II's program accessibility requirements apply to State and local correctional and detention facilities. In the NPRM, in addressing the accessibility of existing correctional and detention facilities, the Department considered the challenges of applying the title II program access requirement for existing facilities under ยง 31.150(a) in light of the realities of many inaccessible correctional facilities and strained budgets.
