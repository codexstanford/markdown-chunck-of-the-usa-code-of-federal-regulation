### PART 72 - SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION
#### ยง 72.7 How sex offenders must register and keep the registration current.
##### Example 2 to paragraph (g)(1).

A sex offender does not register when he is released from custody, or does not register upon entering a jurisdiction to reside as required by 34 U.S.C. 20913(c) and paragraph (c) of this section, because the jurisdiction, at the time, does not register sex offenders based on the offense for which he was convicted. The jurisdiction later sends the sex offender a notice advising that it has extended its registration requirements to include sex offenders like him and directing him to report to a specified agency within 90 days to register. The sex offender must report to the agency to register within the specified timeframe.
