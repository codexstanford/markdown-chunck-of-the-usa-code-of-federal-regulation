##### Dispersion of Cells.,e.g.,,e.g.,

The NPRM did not contain express language addressing dispersion of cells in a facility. However, Advisory 232.2 of the 2004 ADAAG recommends that "[a]ccessible cells or rooms should be dispersed among different levels of security, housing categories, and holding classifications (male/female and adult/juvenile) to facilitate access." In explaining the basis for recommending, but not requiring, this type of dispersal, the Access Board stated that "[m]any detention and correctional facilities are designed so that certain areas ('shift' areas) can be adapted to serve as different types of housing according to need" and that "[p]lacement of accessible cells or rooms in shift areas may allow additional flexibility in meeting requirements for dispersion of accessible cells or rooms."

The Department notes that inmates are typically housed in separate areas of detention and correctional facilities based on a number of factors, including their classification level. In many instances, detention and correctional facilities have housed inmates in inaccessible cells, even though accessible cells were available elsewhere in the facility, because there were no cells in the areas where they needed to be housed, such as in administrative or disciplinary segregation, the women's section of the facility, or in a particular security classification area.

The Department received a number of comments stating that dispersal of accessible cells together with an adequate number of accessible cells is necessary to prevent inmates with disabilities from placement in improper security classification and to ensure integration. Commenters recommended modification of the scoping requirements to require a percentage of accessible cells in each program, classification, use or service area. The Department is persuaded by these comments. Accordingly, ยง 35.151(k)(1) and (k)(2) of the final rule require accessible cells in each classification area.
