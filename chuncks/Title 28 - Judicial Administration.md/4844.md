### PART 72 - SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION
#### ยง 72.8 Liability for violations.
##### Example 1 to paragraph (a)(2).,See

A sex offender changes residence from one jurisdiction to another, bringing into play SORNA's requirement to register in each jurisdiction where the sex offender resides and SORNA's requirement to appear in person and report changes of residence within three business days.34 U.S.C. 20913(a), (c). The sex offender attempts to comply with these requirements by contacting the local sheriff's office, which is responsible for sex offender registration in the destination jurisdiction. The sheriff's office advises that it cannot schedule an appointment for him to register within three business days but that he should come by in a week. The sex offender would have a defense to liability if he appeared at the sheriff's office at the appointed time and registered as required. The sex offender's temporary inability to register and inability to report the change of residence within three business days in the new residence jurisdiction was due to a circumstance beyond his control-the sheriff office's refusal to meet with him until a week had passed-and he complied with the requirement to register as soon as the circumstance preventing compliance ceased to exist.
