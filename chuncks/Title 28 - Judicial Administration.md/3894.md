##### Exigent circumstances involving risk of death or serious bodily harm.

(l)(1) A Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division may authorize the use of compulsory legal process that would otherwise require authorization from the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General if the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division determines that:

(i) The exigent use of such compulsory legal process is necessary to prevent the risks described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

(ii) Those exigent circumstances require the use of such compulsory legal process before the authorization of the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General can, with due diligence, be obtained.

(2) In authorizing the exigent use of compulsory legal process, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division should take into account the principles set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; ensure that the proposed process is narrowly tailored to retrieve information or records required to prevent or mitigate the associated imminent risk; and require members of the Department to comply with the safeguarding protocols described in paragraph (p) of this section.

(3) As soon as possible after the approval by a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of a request under paragraph (l)(1) of this section, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General must provide notice to the designated authorizing official, the Deputy Attorney General, and the Director of the Office of Public Affairs. Within 10 business days of the authorization under paragraph (l)(1) of this section, the United States Attorney or Assistant Attorney General responsible for the matter shall provide a statement to the designated authorizing official containing the information that would have been provided in a request for prior authorization.
