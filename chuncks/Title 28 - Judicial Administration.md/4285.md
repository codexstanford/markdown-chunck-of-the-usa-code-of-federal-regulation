(f)Following the effective date of a confirmed plan, reorganized debtors and any other authorized parties who have been charged with administering the confirmed plan must file with the court and serve upon the United States Trustee, any governmental unit charged with responsibility for collection or determination of any tax arising out of such operation, and any requesting party in interest quarterly post-confirmation reports using UST Form 11-PCR. In jointly administered cases, unless otherwise required by the United States Trustee in the United States Trustee's discretion, each jointly administered debtor, reorganized debtor, or other authorized party who has been charged with administering a confirmed plan is required to file a separate PCR on a nonconsolidated basis. The PCR must contain the following:

(1) Date the petition was filed and the date of plan confirmation;

(2) Summary of all post-confirmation amounts disbursed. This summary must be segregated into disbursements during the most recent reporting period and total disbursements since the date of the confirmation order;

(3) All preconfirmation professional fees approved by the court in the case for the most recent period and cumulatively since the date of the order for relief (separately reported, for the professional fees incurred by or on behalf of the debtor, between those that would have been incurred absent a bankruptcy case and those not);

(4) Information regarding the recoveries of holders of claims under confirmed plans. This information must be expressed in aggregate dollar values and, in the case of claims, as a percentage of total claims of the class allowed;

(5) Information on whether a final decree has been entered or is anticipated to be entered; and

(6) Information about the payment of quarterly fees to the United States Trustee during the reporting period.
