###### ยง 91.56 Actions that normally require the preparation of an environmental assessment.
####### Renovation or expansion of existing correctional facility.

(a)Renovation or expansion activities not categorically excluded under ยง 91.55 require an environmental assessment (EA). An environmental assessment is generally prepared when a project is not expected to have a significant impact on the environment. Since projects for the renovation or expansion of an existing facility or the construction of a new facility within an existing correctional complex may have limited impact on the environment, preparing an EA may be sufficient.
