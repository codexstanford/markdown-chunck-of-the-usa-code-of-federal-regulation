(b)When a request for records includes a document from a non-Federal agency, CSOSA staff must make a release determination.

(1) A release determination on the records from non-Federal agencies shall be analyzed on a case-by-case to determine if CSOSA or the non-Federal agency is best able to decide a record's sensitivity, and in turn its exemption status, in which case:

(i) The requester will be re-routed to submit a separate FOIA request to the non-Federal agency; or

(ii) CSOSA will consult with the non-Federal agency only if the non-Federal agency will provide a consultation within five (5) business days.

(2) [Reserved]
