####### Random Searches.

(a)This type of search may occur at any time, and is not based on any particular suspicion that a non-inmate is attempting to bring a prohibited object into a Bureau facility or Bureau grounds.

(1) Random searches must be impartial and not discriminate among non-inmates on the basis of age, race, religion, national origin, or sex.

(2) Non-inmates will be given the option of either consenting to random searches as a condition of entry, or refusing such searches and leaving Bureau grounds. However, if a non-inmate refuses to submit to a random search and expresses an intent to leave Bureau grounds, he or she may still be required to be searched if "reasonable suspicion" exists as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
