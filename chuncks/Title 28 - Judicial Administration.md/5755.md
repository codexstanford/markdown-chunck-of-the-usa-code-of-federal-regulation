(2) The Special Master may require as part of the notice requirement pursuant to ยง 104.4(b) that the Personal Representative of the deceased individual provide copies of a designated portion of the Eligibility Form to the immediate family of the decedent (including, but not limited to, the spouse, former spouses, children, other dependents, and parents), to the executor, administrator, and beneficiaries of the decedent's will, and to any other persons who may reasonably be expected to assert an interest in an award or to have a cause of action to recover damages relating to the wrongful death of the decedent.

(3) The Eligibility Form may require claimants to provide the following proof:

(i) Proof of death: Death certificate or similar official documentation;

(ii) Proof of presence at site: Documentation sufficient to establish presence at a 9/11 crash site, which may include, without limitation, a death certificate, proof of residence, such as a lease or utility bill, records of employment or school attendance, contemporaneous medical records, contemporaneous records of federal, state, city or local government, a pay stub, official personnel roster, site credentials, an affidavit or declaration of the decedent's or injured claimant's employer, or other sworn statement (or unsworn statement complying with 28 U.S.C. 1746) regarding the presence of the victim;

(iii) Proof of physical harm: Certification of a conclusion by the WTC Health Program that the claimant suffers from a WTC-Related Physical Health Condition and is eligible for treatment under the WTC Health Program, or verification by the WTC Program Administrator that the claimant suffers from a WTC-Related Physical Health Condition, or other credible medical records from a licensed medical professional.

(iv) Personal Representative: Copies of relevant legal documentation, including court orders; letters testamentary or similar documentation; proof of the purported Personal Representative's relationship to the decedent; copies of wills, trusts, or other testamentary documents; and information regarding other possible beneficiaries as requested by the Eligibility Form;

(v) Any other information that the Special Master deems necessary to determine the claimant's eligibility.

(vi) The Special Master may also require waivers, consents, or authorizations from claimants to obtain directly from third parties tax returns, medical information, employment information, or other information that the Special Master deems relevant in determining the claimant's eligibility or award, and may request an opportunity to review originals of documents submitted in connection with the Fund.

(vii) The Special Master may publish a list of individuals who have filed Eligibility Forms on behalf of a deceased victim and the names of the deceased victims for whom compensation is sought, but shall not publish the content of any such form.
