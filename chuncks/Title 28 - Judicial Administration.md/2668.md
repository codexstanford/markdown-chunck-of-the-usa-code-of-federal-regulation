The ADA Amendments Act significantly expanded the range of major life activities by directing that "major" be interpreted in a more expansive fashion, by adding a significant new category of major life activities, and by providing non-exhaustive lists of examples of major life activities. The amended statute's first list of major life activities includes, but is not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. 12102(2)(A). The ADA Amendments Act also broadened the definition of "major life activity" to include physical or mental impairments that substantially limit the operation of a "major bodily function," which include, but are not limited to, the "functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. 12102(2)(B). These expanded lists of examples of major life activities reflect Congress's directive to expand the meaning of the term "major" in response to court decisions that interpreted the term more narrowly than Congress intended.Public Law 110-25, sec. 3 (b)(4).
