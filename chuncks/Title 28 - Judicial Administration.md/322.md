A Federal prisoner committed under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act may be released on parole in the discretion of the Commission after completion of at least six months in treatment, not including any period of time for "study" prior to final judgment of the court. Before parole is ordered by the Commission, the Surgeon General or his designated representative must certify that the prisoner has made sufficient progress to warrant his release and the Attorney General or his designated representative must also report to the Commission whether the prisoner should be released. Recertification by the Surgeon General prior to reparole consideration is not required (18 U.S.C. 4254).
