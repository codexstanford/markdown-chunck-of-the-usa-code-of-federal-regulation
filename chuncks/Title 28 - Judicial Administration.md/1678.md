#### Subpart C - Preservation of Biological Evidence
##### ยง 28.22 The requirement to preserve biological evidence.
###### Inapplicability at the investigative stage.

(1)The requirement of section 3600A to preserve biological evidence does not apply at the investigative stage of criminal cases, occurring prior to the conviction and sentencing to imprisonment of a defendant. Biological evidence may be collected and preserved in the investigation of Federal offenses prior to the sentencing of a defendant to imprisonment, reflecting sound investigative practice and the need for evidence in trial proceedings that may result from the investigation, but section 3600A does not govern these activities.
