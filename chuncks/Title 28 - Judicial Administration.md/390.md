##### ยง 2.48 Revocation: Preliminary interview.
###### Release notwithstanding probable cause.

(e)If the Commission finds probable cause to believe that the parolee has violated the conditions of his release, reinstatement to supervision or release pending further proceeding may nonetheless be ordered if it is determined that:

(1) Continuation of revocation proceedings is not warranted despite the violations found; or

(2) Incarceration pending further revocation proceedings is not warranted by the alleged frequency or seriousness of such violation or violations, and that the parolee is not likely to fail to appear for further proceedings, and that the parolee does not constitute a danger to himself or others.
