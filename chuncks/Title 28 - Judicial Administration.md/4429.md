##### Typical Classes of Action Requiring Similar Treatment Under NEPA.

2.

(a) Section 1507.3(c)(2) in conjunction with ยง 1508.4 requires agencies to establish three typical classes of action for similar treatment under NEPA. These typical classes of action are set forth below:

(b) For the principal DEA program requiring environmental review, the following chart identifies the point at which the NEPA process begins, the point at which it ends, and the key agency officials or offices required to consider environmental documents in their decisionmaking.

(c) The DEA shall independently determine whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:

(1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the typical classes of action in (a) above; or

(2) For actions which are covered, the presence of extraordinary circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.
