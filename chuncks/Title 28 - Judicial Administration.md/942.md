##### ยง 11.8 Salary offset.
###### Precedence of salary deductions by the Department.

(4)(i) For Department employees, debts owed shall be paid out of disposable pay in the following order of precedence:

(A) Indebtedness due the Department.

(B) Indebtedness due other agencies.

(C) Garnishments for alimony and child support payments.

(D) Court-ordered bankruptcy payments under the Bankruptcy Code.

(E) Optional life insurance premiums.

(F) Other voluntary deductions including allotments and assignments, in the order determined by the paying agency.

(ii) In the event that a debt to the Department is certified while an employee is subject to salary offset to repay another agency, the applicable payroll office may decide whether the debt to the other agency should be repaid in full before collecting the Department's claim or whether changes should be made in the salary deduction being sent to the other agency. If debts owed to the Department can be collected in one pay period, the payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the Department's debt.
