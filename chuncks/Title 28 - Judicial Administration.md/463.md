###### Supervised release.

(l)(1) If a period of supervised release is imposed, the Commission presumes that the recommended conditions of supervised release in section 5D1.3(a) and (c) of the sentencing guidelines, a condition requiring the transferee to report to the probation office within 72 hours of release from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, a condition that the transferee not commit another Federal, state or local crime, and a condition that the transferee not possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon are reasonably necessary in every case. These conditions, therefore, shall be imposed unless the Commission finds otherwise. The Commission may also impose special conditions of supervised release whenever deemed reasonably necessary in an individual case.

(2) If the transferee is released pursuant to a date established by the Bureau of Prisons under 18 U.S.C. 4105(c)(1), then the period of supervised release commences upon the transferee's release from imprisonment.
