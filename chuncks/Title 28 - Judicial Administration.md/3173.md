#### Appendix B to Part 36 - Analysis and Commentary on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design
##### Shower Spray Controls.

In accessible bathtubs and shower compartments, sections 607.6 and 608.6 of the 2010 Standards require shower spray controls to have an on/off control and to deliver water that is 120 &#xB0;F (49 &#xB0;C) maximum. Neither feature was required by the 1991 Standards, but may be required by plumbing codes. Delivering water that is no hotter than 120 &#xB0;F (49 &#xB0;C) will require controlling the maximum temperature at each accessible shower spray unit.
