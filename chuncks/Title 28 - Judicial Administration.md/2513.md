##### Treatment of "manually-powered mobility aids."

The Department's NPRM did not define the term "manually-powered mobility aids." Instead, the NPRM included a non-exhaustive list of examples in ยง 35.137(a). The NPRM queried whether the Department should maintain this approach to manually-powered mobility aids or whether it should adopt a more formal definition.

Only a few commenters addressed "manually-powered mobility aids." Virtually all commenters were in favor of maintaining a non-exhaustive list of examples of "manually-powered mobility aids" rather than adopting a definition of the term. Of those who commented, a few sought clarification of the term "manually-powered." One commenter suggested that the term be changed to "human-powered." Other commenters requested that the Department include ordinary strollers in the non-exhaustive list of "manually-powered mobility aids." Since strollers are not devices designed primarily for individuals with mobility disabilities, the Department does not consider them to be manually-powered mobility aids; however, strollers used in the context of transporting individuals with disabilities are subject to the same assessment required by the ADA's title II reasonable modification standards at ยง 35.130(b)(7). The Department believes that because the existing approach is clear and understood easily by the public, no formal definition of the term "manually-powered mobility aids" is required.
