Section 258f of the Declaration of Taking Act, 40 U.S.C. 258a,contains the following provision:

In any condemnation proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the United States, the Attorney General is authorized to stipulate or agree in behalf of the United States to exclude any property or any part thereof, or any interest therein, that may have been, or may be, taken by or on behalf of the United States by declaration of taking or otherwise.

The foregoing authority has been delegated to the Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources Division, by the Attorney General, chapter I, part O, subpart M, §§ 0.65 and 0.160(a)(2), title 28, Code of Federal Regulations.

In view of the frequency of agency requests that this office stipulate or agree to exclude property or parts of property taken by declaration of taking or otherwise, and in the interest of efficient administration of the duties and responsibilities of this office, I hereby make the following limited delegation of authority to stipulate or agree to such exclusions (revestments).

The Chief, Land Acquisition Section, is authorized to stipulate or agree in behalf of the United States to exclude (revest) any property or any part thereof, or any interest therein, that may have been, or may be taken by or on behalf of the United States by declaration of taking or otherwise, when:

1. The exclusion (revestment) has been requested or approved in writing by a duly authorized officer of the agency for which the property was taken; and

2. In the case of a partial exclusion (revestment) in connection with an overall settlement of the case, the combined amount of the monetary payment of compensation and the government's appraised value of the land to be excluded (revested) does not exceed the monetary limitation on the Section Chief's settlement authority; or

3. In the case of an exclusion (revestment) that is not part of an overall settlement of the case, the government's appraised value of the land to be excluded (revested) together with any payment of compensation for possession and/or litigation expenses do not exceed the monetary limitations of the Section Chief's settlement authority.

Provided that the delegation of settlement authority shall not extend to any revestment which raises precedential questions or policy issues. In such instances, the decision on whether to stipulate or agree to exclusions of property shall remain with the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment and Natural Resources Division.
