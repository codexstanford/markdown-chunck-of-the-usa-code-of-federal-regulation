### PART 35 - NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY IN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES
#### Appendix C to Part 35 - Guidance to Revisions to ADA Title II and Title III Regulations Revising the Meaning and Interpretation of the Definition of "Disability" and Other Provisions in Order To Incorporate the Requirements of the ADA Amendments Act
##### See

In the NPRM, the Department proposed §§ 35.108(a)(2) and 36.105(a)(2), which set forth rules of construction on how to apply the definition of "disability." Proposed §§ 35.108(a)(2)(i) and 36.105(a)(2)(i) state that an individual may establish coverage under any one or more of the prongs in the definition of "disability"-the "actual disability" prong in paragraph (a)(1)(i), the "record of" prong in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or the "regarded as" prong in paragraph (a)(1)(iii).§§ 35.108(a)(1)(i) through (iii); 36.105(a)(1)(i) through (iii). The NPRM's inclusion of rules of construction stemmed directly from the ADA Amendments Act, which amended the ADA to require that the definition of "disability" be interpreted in conformance with several specific directives and an overarching mandate to ensure "broad coverage . . . to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of [the ADA]." 42 U.S.C. 12102(4)(A).
