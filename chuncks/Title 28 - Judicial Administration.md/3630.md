###### Post-approval review.

(c)(1) Federal agencies shall establish and maintain an effective program of post-approval compliance reviews regarding approved new applications (see 28 CFR 50.3(c) II A), applications for continuation or renewal of assistance (28 CFR 50.3(c) II B) and all other federally assisted programs. Such reviews are to include periodic submission of compliance reports by recipients to the agencies and, where appropriate, field reviews of a representative number of major recipients. In carrying out this program, agency personnel shall follow agency manuals which establish appropriate review procedures and standards of evaluation. Additionally, agencies should consider incorporating a title VI component into general program reviews and audits.

(2) The results of post-approval reviews shall be committed to writing and shall include specific findings of fact and recommendations. A determination of the compliance status of the recipient reviewed shall be made as promptly as possible.
