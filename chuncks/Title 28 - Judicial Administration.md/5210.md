(c)An attorney may not represent a claimant or beneficiary unless the attorney is engaged in the private practice of law and an active member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a state. Attorneys who are members of multiple state bars, and who are suspended, sanctioned, disbarred, or disqualified from the practice of law for professional misconduct in one state may not represent a claimant or beneficiary even though the attorney continues to remain in good standing of the bar of another state. If a claimant or beneficiary is represented by an attorney, then the attorney must submit the following documents to the Program along with the claim:

(1) A statement of the attorney's active membership in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a state; and

(2) A signed representation agreement, retainer agreement, fee agreement, or contract, documenting the attorney's authorization to represent the claimant or beneficiary. The document must acknowledge that the Act's fee limitations are satisfied.
