In response to the Department's questions concerning the parameters of the option to provide open movie captioning rather than closed movie captioning, several commenters suggested that the Department define what constitutes a "timely request" when a movie patron requests open movie captioning. These commenters provided a variety of suggestions, which ranged from the specific (1 hour or 1 day before the showing) to the ambiguous (it should be reasonably easy).

Other comments also addressed whether the Department adequately addressed new technology. One commenter agreed that the "different technology" language encompassed any future technology, but further suggested that the effectiveness of new technologies should be judged from the baseline of "as effective as captioning and/or audio description devices." Other commenters disagreed and criticized the rule for not addressing other currently available technologies, such as hearing loop systems, Invisivisionglasses, or smart phone applications.

After considering all of the comments, the Department has decided to retain the option to comply with the captioning and audio description requirements of this rule through the use of any other technology that is or becomes available to provide effective communication to patrons with hearing and vision disabilities, including open movie captioning. The Department has clarified, however, that in those circumstances where a public accommodation chooses to use open movie captioning at all showings of all movies available with captioning or at all times it receives a request to turn on open movie captions prior to the start of the movie, it is not also required to comply with the specific requirement to obtain captioning devices. However, if a public accommodation only makes open movie captioning available to patrons who are deaf or hard of hearing at some showings of movies available with captioning, it will still have to comply with the requirements to provide captioning devices because it must provide effective communication at all showings of all movies available with captioning.
