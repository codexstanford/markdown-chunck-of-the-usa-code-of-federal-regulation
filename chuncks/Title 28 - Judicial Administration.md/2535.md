In the NPRM, the Department stated the intention of providing the broadest feasible access to individuals with disabilities and their service animals, unless a public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications to policies excluding animals would fundamentally alter the nature of the public entity's service, program, or activity. The Department proposed creating a new ยง 35.136 addressing service animals that was intended to retain the scope of the 1991 title III regulation at ยง 36.302(c), while clarifying the Department's longstanding policies and interpretations, as outlined in published technical assistance,(1996), available atand(1999), available at, and to add that a public entity may exclude a service animal in certain circumstances where the service animal fails to meet certain behavioral standards. The Department received extensive comments in response to proposed ยง 35.136 from individuals, disability advocacy groups, organizations involved in training service animals, and public entities. Those comments and the Department's response are discussed below.
