#### ยง 72.7 How sex offenders must register and keep the registration current.
##### Example 1 to paragraph (g)(1).,i.e.,

A sex offender convicted in a state does not initially register before release from imprisonment, as required by 34 U.S.C. 20913(b)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, because the state has no procedure for pre-release registration of sex offenders. Instead, the state informs sex offenders that they must go to a local police station within seven days of release to register. The sex offender must comply with the state's requirements for initial registration,the offender must report to the police station to register within seven days of release.
