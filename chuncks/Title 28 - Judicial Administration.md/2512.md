Most environmental, transit system, and government commenters were opposed to including the Segway&#xAE; PT in the definition of "wheelchair" but were supportive of its inclusion as an "other power-driven mobility device." Their concerns about including the Segway&#xAE; PT in the definition of "wheelchair" had to do with the safety of the operators of these devices (height clearances on trains and sloping trails in parks) and of pedestrians, particularly in confined and crowded facilities or in settings where motorized devices might be unexpected; the potential harm to the environment; the additional administrative, insurance, liability, and defensive litigation costs; potentially detrimental impacts on the environment and cultural and natural resources; and the impracticality of accommodating such devices in public transportation settings.

Other environmental, transit system, and government commenters would have banned all fuel-powered devices as mobility devices. In addition, these commenters would have classified non-motorized devices as "wheelchairs" and would have categorized motorized devices, such as the Segway&#xAE; PT, battery-operated wheelchairs, and mobility scooters as "other power-driven mobility devices." In support of this position, some of these commenters argued that because their equipment and facilities have been designed to comply with the dimensions of the "common wheelchair" upon which the ADAAG is based, any device that is larger than the prototype wheelchair would be misplaced in the definition of "wheelchair."

Still others in this group of commenters wished for only a single category of mobility devices and would have included wheelchairs, mobility scooters, and the Segway&#xAE; PT as "mobility devices" and excluded fuel-powered devices from that definition.

Many disability advocacy and nonprofit commenters did not support the inclusion of the Segway&#xAE; PT in the definition of "wheelchair." Paramount to these commenters was the maintenance of existing protections for wheelchair users. Because there was unanimous agreement that wheelchair use rarely, if ever, may be restricted, these commenters strongly favored categorizing wheelchairs separately from the Segway&#xAE; PT and other power-driven mobility devices and applying the intended-use determinant to assign the devices to either category. They indicated that while they support the greatest degree of access in public entities for all persons with disabilities who require the use of mobility devices, they recognize that under certain circumstances, allowing the use of other power-driven mobility devices would result in a fundamental alteration of programs, services, or activities, or run counter to legitimate safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of a public entity. While these groups supported categorizing the Segway&#xAE; PT as an "other power-driven mobility device," they universally noted that in their view, because the Segway&#xAE; PT does not present environmental concerns and is as safe to use as, if not safer than, a wheelchair, it should be accommodated in most circumstances.

The Department has considered all the comments and has concluded that it should not include the Segway&#xAE; PT in the definition of "wheelchair." The final rule provides that the test for categorizing a device as a wheelchair or an other power-driven mobility device is whether the device is designed primarily for use by individuals with mobility disabilities. Mobility scooters are included in the definition of "wheelchair" because they are designed primarily for users with mobility disabilities. However, because the current generation of EPAMDs, including the Segway&#xAE; PT, was designed for recreational users and not primarily for use by individuals with mobility disabilities, the Department has decided to continue its approach of excluding EPAMDs from the definition of "wheelchair" and including them in the definition of "other power-driven mobility device." Although EPAMDs, such as the Segway&#xAE; PT, are not included in the definition of a "wheelchair," public entities must assess whether they can make reasonable modifications to permit individuals with mobility disabilities to use such devices on their premises. The Department recognizes that the Segway&#xAE; PT provides many benefits to those who use them as mobility devices, including a measure of privacy with regard to the nature of one's particular disability, and believes that in the vast majority of circumstances, the application of the factors described in ยง 35.137 for providing access to other-powered mobility devices will result in the admission of the Segway&#xAE; PT.
