##### Alterations.

Although the 2010 Standards contain specifications for alterations in existing detention and correctional facilities, section 232.2 defers to the Attorney General the decision as to the extent these requirements will apply to alterations of cells. The NPRM proposed at ยง 35.152(c) that "[a]lterations to jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities will comply with the requirements of ยง 35.151(b)." 73 FR 34466, 34507 (June 17, 2008). The final rule retains that requirement at ยง 35.151(k)(2), but increases the scoping for accessible cells from the 2 percent specified in the 2004 ADAAG to 3 percent.
