#### ยง 701.18 Fees.
##### The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns "the operations or activities of the government."

(i)The subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request, must specifically concern the identifiable operations of the federal government-with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their informative value with respect to those government operations or activities; a request for access to records for their intrinsic informational content alone would not satisfy this threshold consideration.
