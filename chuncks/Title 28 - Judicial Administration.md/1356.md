###### Finding.

(a)Based upon a review of the meetings of the U.S. Parole Commission since the effective date of the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act (May 14, 1976), the regulations issued pursuant thereto (28 CFR part 2) the experience of the U.S. Board of Parole, and the regulations pertaining to the Commission's authority under 29 U.S.C. 504 and 29 U.S.C. 1111 (28 CFR parts 4 and 4a), the Commission finds that the majority of its meetings may properly be closed to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (d)(4) and (c)(10). The major part of normal Commission business lies in the adjudication of individual parole cases, all of which proceedings commence with an initial parole or revocation hearing and are determined on the record thereof.
