(a) Except for such camps and other satellite facilities where segregating a newly arrived inmate in detention is not feasible, the Warden shall ensure that a newly arrived inmate is cleared by the Medical Department and provided a social interview by staff before assignment to the general population.

(1) Immediately upon an inmate's arrival, staff shall interview the inmate to determine if there are non-medical reasons for housing the inmate away from the general population. Staff shall evaluate both the general physical appearance and emotional condition of the inmate.

(2) Within 24 hours after an inmate's arrival, medical staff shall medically screen the inmate in compliance with Bureau of Prisons' medical procedures to determine if there are medical reasons for housing the inmate away from the general population or for restricting temporary work assignments.

(3) Staff shall place recorded results of the intake medical screening and the social interview in the inmate's central file.
