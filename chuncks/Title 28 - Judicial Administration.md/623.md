##### ยง 2.219 Maximum terms of imprisonment and supervised release.
###### Imprisonment; successive revocations.

(d)(1) When the Commission revokes a term of supervised release that was imposed by the Commission after a previous revocation of supervised release, the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, less the term or terms of imprisonment that were previously imposed by the Commission. In calculating such previously-imposed term or terms of imprisonment, the Commission shall use the term as imposed without deducting any good time credits that may have been earned by the offender prior to his release from prison. In no case shall the total of successive terms of imprisonment imposed by the Commission exceed the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation.
