(2)In the case of a transferee who has less than six months from the date of his entry into the United States to his release date as calculated by the Bureau of Prisons under 18 U.S.C. 4105, the Commission may, without conducting a hearing or awaiting a waiver, set a release date and a period and conditions of supervised release. In such cases, the period of supervised release shall not exceed the minimum necessary to satisfy the applicable sentencing guideline (but may extend to the full-term of the foreign sentence if such period is shorter than the minimum of applicable sentencing guideline). The transferee may petition the Commission for a more favorable decision within 60 days of the Commission's determination, and the Commission may act upon the petition regardless of whether or not the transferee has been released from prison.
