####### Draft Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or determination that EIS is required.

(e)If the EA satisfies all the factors in OJP's seven-part review set forth in the previous paragraph, OJP will issue a draft FONSI. If OJP's review of the EA results in a response of "no" to any of the questions, except question 6, then the EA is incomplete and will be returned for further work. If the only "no" is in response to question 6, then OJP will issue a determination requiring an EIS for that particular project at that site. Given the cost and time required to complete an EIS, the grantee may wish to explore another alternative site at this point.
