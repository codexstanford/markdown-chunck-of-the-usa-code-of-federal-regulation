### PART 345 - FEDERAL PRISON INDUSTRIES (FPI) INMATE WORK PROGRAMS
#### Subpart F - Inmate Pay and Benefits
##### ยง 345.55 Longevity pay.
###### Exceptions.

(b)(1) FPI work status during service of a previous sentence with a subsequent break in custody may not be considered in determining longevity pay.

(2) An inmate in segregation or who is given a disciplinary transfer loses any longevity status previously achieved.

(3) An inmate who voluntarily transfers to a non-FPI work assignment loses any longevity status previously achieved. An inmate who leaves FPI to enter education, vocational training, or drug abuse treatment programs, however, generally retains longevity and pay grade status upon return to FPI, unless the inmate withdraws from those programs without a good faith effort to complete them. The decision on whether there was a good faith effort is to be made by the SOI in concert with the staff member in charge of the program.
