###### Granting parole.

(f)In determining whether or not to grant parole pursuant to the point score system of the D.C. Board of Parole, and the length of any continuance for a rehearing if parole is denied, the Commission shall presume that the eligible prisoner has satisfied basic accountability for the D.C. Code offense behavior. However, the Commission retains the authority to consider any unusual offense circumstances pursuant to 28 DCMR 204.22 to deny parole despite a favorable point score, and to set a rehearing date beyond the ordinary schedule. The Commission shall also consider whether the totality of the prisoner's offense behaviors (U.S. and D.C. Code) warrants a continuance to reflect the true seriousness or the degree of the risk that the release of the prisoner would pose for the public welfare. Nonetheless, the Commission shall not deny parole or order a continuance, solely on the ground of punishment for the U.S. Code offenses standing alone, or on grounds that have been adequately accounted for in a decision to exceed the federal guideline range.
