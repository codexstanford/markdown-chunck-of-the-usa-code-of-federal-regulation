###### ยง 91.63 Preparing an Environmental Impact Statement
####### Initial determination.

(a)OJP will determine whether a proposed project may have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment, thereby requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS). This determination will be made either:

(1) On the basis of an environmental assessment (EA) prepared for the proposed project or

(2) Without the preparation of an EA, but based on the extensive size of the proposed facility and the resulting variety of environmental impacts, the sensitive environmental nature of the proposed site, and/or the existence of highly controversial environmental impacts.
