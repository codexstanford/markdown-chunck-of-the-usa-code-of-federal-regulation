###### Poorer parole risk than indicated by salient factor score.

(i)The offender is a poorer parole risk than indicated by the salient factor score because of-

(A) Unusually persistent failure under supervision (pretrial release, probation, or parole);

(B) Unusually persistent history of criminally related substance (drug or alcohol) abuse and resistance to treatment efforts; or

(C) Unusually extensive prior record (sufficient to make the offender a poorer risk than the "poor" prognosis category).
