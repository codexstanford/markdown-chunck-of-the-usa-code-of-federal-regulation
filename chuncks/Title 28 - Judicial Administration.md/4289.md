(j)The Periodic Reports must be utilized by debtors and trustees when completing their monthly operating reports or post-confirmation reports. The Periodic Reports shall be used without alteration, except as otherwise provided in this rule, in a particular UST Form 11-MOR or UST Form 11-PCR, or in the instructions for UST Form 11-MOR or UST Form 11-PCR. The Periodic Reports may be modified to permit minor changes not affecting wording or the order of presenting information. All debtors and chapter 11 trustees serving in districts where a United States Trustee is serving must use the Periodic Reports in the administration of their cases, in the same manner and with the same content, as set forth in this Rule.

(1) All Periodic Reports may be electronically or mechanically reproduced so long as the content and the form remain consistent with the Periodic Reports as they are posted on EOUST's website; and

(2) The Periodic Reports shall be filed via the United States Bankruptcy Courts' Case Management/Electronic Case Filing System (CM/ECF) as a "smart form," meaning the reports are data-embedded.
