### PART 50 - STATEMENTS OF POLICY
#### ยง 50.21 Procedures governing the destruction of contraband drug evidence in the custody of Federal law enforcement authorities.
##### Policy.

(c)This regulation is intended to prevent the warehousing of large quantities of seized contraband drugs which are unnecessary for due process in criminal cases. Such stockpiling of contraband drugs presents inordinate security and storage problems which create additional economic burdens on limited law enforcement resources of the United States.
