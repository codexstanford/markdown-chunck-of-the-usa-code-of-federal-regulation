As the Department explained in the NPRM, however, this provision was not designed to prohibit temporary seating that increases seating for events (placing temporary seating on the floor of a basketball court for a concert). Consequently, the final rule, at ยง 35.151(g)(3), has been amended to clarify that if an entire seating section is on a temporary platform for a particular event, then wheelchair spaces and companion seats may be in that seating section. However, adding a temporary platform to create wheelchair spaces and companion seats that are otherwise dissimilar from nearby fixed seating and then simply adding a small number of additional seats to the platform would not qualify as an "entire seating section" on the platform. In addition, ยง 35.151(g)(3) clarifies that facilities may fill in wheelchair spaces with removable seats when the wheelchair spaces are not needed by persons who use wheelchairs.
