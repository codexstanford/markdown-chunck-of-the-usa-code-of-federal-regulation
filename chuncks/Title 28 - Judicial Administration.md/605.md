###### i.e.,

(d) The date the violation term commences is the date the Commission's warrant is executed. A releasee's violation term (the term of imprisonment and/or further term of supervised release that the Commission may require the releasee to serve after revocation) shall start to run only upon the offender's release from the confinement portion of the intervening sentence.

(e) An offender whose supervised release is revoked shall be given credit for all time in confinement resulting from any new offense or violation that is considered by the Commission as a basis for revocation, but solely for the purpose of satisfying the time ranges in the reparole guidelines at ยง 2.21. The computation of the offender's sentence, and the forfeiture of time on supervised release, are not affected by such guideline credit.
