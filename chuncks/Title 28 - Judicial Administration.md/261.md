###### Closing of the Prosecution.

(a) U.S. Attorneys may decline to prosecute any case involving a matter covered by this Memorandum without prior consultation or approval of the Assistant Attorney General. If, however, prosecution has been initiated by way of indictment or information, the indictment or information shall not be dismissed until authority to do so has been obtained from the Assistant Attorney General or his representative unless the reason for the dismissal is one which does not necessitate the prior approval of the Criminal Division. (See U.S. Attorneys' Manual, title 2: Criminal Division, pages 18-20.)

(b) In each instance in which a case is closed by a U.S. Attorney and in which prior approval of the Assistant Attorney General or his representative has not been obtained, a memorandum shall be prepared and placed in the file describing the action taken and the reasons therefor.
