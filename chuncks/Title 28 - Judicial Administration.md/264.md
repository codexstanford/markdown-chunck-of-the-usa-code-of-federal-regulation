2.Pursuant to paragraph 10 of the memorandum of understanding between the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (42 FR 48942) with respect to the handling of litigation to which the Environmental Protection Agency is a party, all requests of the Environmental Protection Agency for litigation must be submitted by the Agency through its General Counsel or its Assistant Administrator for Enforcement to the Assistant Attorney General, except that matters requiring an immediate temporary restraining order may be submitted by regional Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency simultaneously to a U.S. Attorney and the Assistant Attorney General. Consequently, except for matters requiring an immediate temporary restraining order, U.S. Attorneys are not authorized to accept on a direct reference basis any matters or cases originating in any office of the Environmental Protection Agency.

U.S. Attorneys are authorized to act, without prior authorization from the Environment and Natural Resources Division, on behalf of Federal departments or agencies other than the Environmental Protection Agency, in response to a direct request in writing from an authorized field officer of the department or agency concerned, in the following environmental cases:

(a) Civil or criminal actions involving the filling or the deposit of dredged or fill material upon, or the alteration of the channels of, the waters of the United States, in violation of section 10 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403), or of section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1344), or of both statutes;

(b) Civil or criminal actions involving the discharge of refuse into the navigable waters of the United States, and, in certain cases, their tributaries, in violation of section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 407), except for

(i) In rem actions against vessels, which actions shall continue to be handled in the manner set forth in departmental memorandums 374 and 376, dated June 3, 1964, and shall continue to be under the jurisdiction of the Civil Division; and

(ii) Criminal actions involving the discharge either of oil or of hazardous substances, for which discharge a government agency either has imposed a civil penalty pursuant to section 311(b)(6) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(6)), or has under consideration the imposition of such a penalty.
