###### Review of the records.

(c)The Assistant Director will examine the other records submitted in support of the claim to prove those matters set forth in all other sections of the Act and this part, and will determine whether such records satisfy all other criteria for eligibility. For the purposes of verifying such eligibility, the Assistant Director may require the claimant or eligible surviving beneficiary to provide an authorization to release any record identified in this part. If the Assistant Director determines that the records do not satisfy the criteria for eligibility established by the Act and this part, the Assistant Director shall so advise the claimant or eligible surviving beneficiary in writing, setting forth the reasons for the determination, and shall provide the claimant or eligible surviving beneficiary 60 days from the date of notification, or such greater period as the Assistant Director permits, to furnish additional records to satisfy the requirements of the Act and this part. Where appropriate, the Assistant Director may require the claimant or eligible surviving beneficiary to provide an authorization to release additional records as an alternative to, or in addition to, the claimant or eligible beneficiary furnishing such additional records. If the claimant or eligible beneficiary fails within 60 days or the greater period approved by the Assistant Director, to provide sufficient records or a valid release when requested by the Assistant Director, then the Assistant Director shall, without further review, issue a Decision denying the claim.
