The language in the first sentence of ยง 36.303(c)(1)(ii) is derived from the Department's Technical Assistance Manual.Department of Justice, Americans with Disabilities Act,III-4.3200, available atThere were few comments regarding inclusion of this policy in the regulation itself, and those received were positive.

Many advocacy groups, particularly those representing blind individuals and those with low vision, urged the Department to add language in the final rule requiring the provision of accessible material in a manner that is timely, accurate, and private. This, they argued, would be especially important with regard to billing information, other time-sensitive material, or confidential information. The Department has added a provision in ยง 36.303(c)(1)(ii) stating that in "order to be effective, auxiliary aids and services must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and in such a way so as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual with a disability."
