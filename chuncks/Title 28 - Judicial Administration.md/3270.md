In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 79 FR 44976 (Aug. 1, 2014) (NPRM), the Department proposed ยง 36.303(g)(1), which set forth definitions for certain terms specifically referenced in paragraph (g). The Department sought public comment on these proposed definitions.

Although the Department did not specifically propose a definition of "analog movie" in the NPRM, the Department defined the term in the preamble and solicited comment on the state of analog movies and their availability. In the final rule, the Department has added a definition of "analog movie" in order to distinguish between movies shown in digital cinema format and movies shown in analog format. "Analog movie" is defined to mean "a movie exhibited in analog film format."

In the NPRM, the Department used the term "audio description" to refer to the spoken description of information describing the visual elements of a movie to an individual who is blind or has low vision and who is unable to see the images and action on the screen. Proposed ยง 36.303(g)(1)(i) defined "audio description" as the "provision of a spoken narration of key visual elements of a visually delivered medium, including, but not limited to, actions, settings, facial expressions, costumes, and scene changes." Although the Department believes that the term "audio description" is most commonly used to describe this service, it sought public comment on whether to use this or some other nomenclature.
