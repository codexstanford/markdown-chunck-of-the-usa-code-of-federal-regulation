###### Section 42.202(g).

Section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA limits suspension and termination of assistance in the event of noncompliance to the "programs or activity" in which the noncompliance is found. The phrase "program or activity" was first used in section 815(c)(1) of the Crime Control Act of 1976, the substantially identical predecessor to section 815(c)(1).

House Report No. 94-1155 (94th Congress, 2d Session), at p. 26, explained the provision as follows:

"Suspension may be limited to the specific program or activity found to have discriminated, rather than all of the recipients' LEAA funds.

"For example, if discriminatory employment practices in a city's police department were cited in the notification, LEAA may only suspend that part of the city's payments which fund the police department. LEAA may not suspend the city's LEAA funds which are used in the city courts, prisons, or juvenile justice agencies."
