### PART 72 - SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION
#### ยง 72.8 Liability for violations.
##### Example 3 to paragraph (a)(2).

A sex offender needs to travel to a foreign country on short notice-less than 21 days-because of an unforeseeable family or work emergency. The sex offender would have a defense to liability for failing to report the intended travel 21 days in advance, as required by ยง 72.7(f), because it is impossible to report an intention to travel outside the United States before the intention exists. However, if the sex offender failed to inform the registration jurisdiction (albeit on short notice) once he intended to travel, 18 U.S.C. 2250(c) would not excuse that failure, because the preventing circumstance-absence of an intent to travel abroad-would no longer exist.
