(b)The Assistant Director will examine the medical documentation submitted in support of the claim and determine whether it satisfies the criteria for eligibility established by the Act and this part.

If the Assistant Director determines that the documentation does not satisfy the criteria for eligibility established by the Act and this part, the Assistant Director shall so advise the claimant or eligible surviving beneficiary in writing, setting forth the reason(s) for the determination, and shall allow the claimant or eligible beneficiary 60 days from the date of notification, or such greater period as the Assistant Director permits, to furnish additional medical documentation that meets the requirements of the Act and this part.

If the claimant or eligible beneficiary fails, within 60 days or the greater period approved by the Assistant Director, to provide sufficient medical documentation or a valid release when requested by the Assistant Director, then the Assistant Director shall, without further review, issue a Decision denying the claim.
