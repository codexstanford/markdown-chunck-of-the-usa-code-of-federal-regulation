#### Subpart D - District of Columbia Supervised Releasees
##### ยง 2.219 Maximum terms of imprisonment and supervised release.
###### Further term of supervised release; first revocation.

(b)(1) When a term of supervised release is revoked, and the Commission imposes less than the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may also impose a further term of supervised release after imprisonment. A term of imprisonment is "less than the maximum authorized term of imprisonment" if the term is one day or more shorter than the maximum authorized term of imprisonment.

(2) The maximum authorized length of such further term of supervised release shall be the original maximum term of supervised release that the sentencing court was authorized to impose for the offense of conviction, less the term of imprisonment imposed by the Commission upon revocation of supervised release. The original maximum authorized term of supervised release is as follows:

(i) Five years if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is 25 years or more;

(ii) Three years if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is more than one year but less than 25 years; and

(iii) Life if the person is required to register for life, and 10 years in any other case, if the offender has been sentenced for an offense for which registration is required by the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1999.

(3) For example, if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation is three years and the original maximum authorized term of supervised release is five years, the Commission may impose a three-year term of imprisonment with no supervised release to follow, or any term of imprisonment of less than three years with a further term of supervised release of five years minus the term of imprisonment actually imposed (such as a one-year term of imprisonment followed by a four-year term of supervised release, or a two-year term of imprisonment followed by a three-year term of supervised release).
