(a)If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record, including his recommended findings and proposed decision, to the responsible Department official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Whenever the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the responsible Department official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Department official may on his own motion, within 45 days after the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon filing of such exceptions, or of such notice of review, the responsible Department official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Department official.
