#### Subpart A - General
##### ยง 36.105 Definition of "disability."
###### Rules of construction.

(2)(i) The definition of "disability" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA.

(ii) An individual may establish coverage under any one or more of the three prongs of the definition of "disability" in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the "actual disability" prong in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the "record of" prong in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, or the "regarded as" prong in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

(iii) Where an individual is not challenging a public accommodation's failure to provide reasonable modifications under ยง 36.302, it is generally unnecessary to proceed under the "actual disability" or "record of" prongs, which require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment. In these cases, the evaluation of coverage can be made solely under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of "disability," which does not require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment. An individual may choose, however, to proceed under the "actual disability" or "record of" prong regardless of whether the individual is challenging a public accommodation's failure to provide reasonable modifications.
