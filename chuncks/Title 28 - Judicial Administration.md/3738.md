(a) A recipient may take an action, otherwise prohibited by ยง 42.710(a), that affects age groups differently, if such differentiation is based upon reasonable factors other than age.

(b) This exception does not apply to the use of an explicit age distinction, but to conduct that has the effect of differentiating among age groups.
