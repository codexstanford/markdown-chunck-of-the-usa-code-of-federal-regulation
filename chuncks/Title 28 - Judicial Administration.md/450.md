(7) It is the Commission's interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 4106A that U.S. Code provisions for mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment and supervised release, as well as sentencing guideline provisions implementing such U.S. Code requirements (section 5G1.1(b) of the sentencing guidelines), were not intended by Congress to be applicable in an 18 U.S.C. 4106A(b)(1)(A) determination. Alternatively, it is the Commission's position that there is good cause in every transfer treaty case for a departure from any statutorily required minimum sentence provision in the sentencing guidelines, including section 5G1.1(b) of the sentencing guidelines, because Congress did not enact mandatory sentence laws with transferees in mind. Thus, in every transfer treaty case, the release date will be determined through an exercise of Commission discretion, according to the sentencing guideline range that is derived from a case-specific "similar offense" determination, rather than by reference to any provision concerning mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment or terms of supervised release.
