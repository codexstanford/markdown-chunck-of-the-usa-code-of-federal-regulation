##### The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is "likely to contribute" to an understanding or government operations or activities.

(ii)The disclosable portions of requested records must be meaningfully informative or specific governmental operations or activities in order to hold potential for contributing to increased public understanding of those operations and activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would be added to the public record.
