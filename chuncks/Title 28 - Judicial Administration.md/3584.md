The Senate Judiciary Committee Report on the JSIA also emphasized that section 815(b) does not "undercut subsection (c) in any way; subsection (b) has been interpreted so as not to limit LEAA's anti-discrimination enforcement capabilities. Indeed, recent court decisions have made this abundantly clear. See, e.g.,v.No. 77-3460 (C.D. Cal. 2/1/79)." S. Rept. 96-142, p. 57.
