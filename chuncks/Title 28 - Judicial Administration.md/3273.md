Commenters were equally split as to whether the Department should use "closed movie captioning" or some other language to refer to the technology. Some commenters urged the Department to use the term "closed captioning." Other commenters disagreed, however, and stated that the Department should avoid using the term "closed captioning" to distinguish it from the "closed captioning" that is turned on at home by a person viewing the television. In the final rule, the Department is retaining the term "closed movie captioning," but the definition is modified for clarity to read: "means the written display of a movie's dialogue and non-speech information, such as music, the identity of the character who is speaking, and other sounds or sound effects.generally requires the use of a captioning device for delivery of the captions to the patron."

The Department has added a definition of "digital movie," meaning "a movie exhibited in digital cinema format."

The NPRM proposed defining "movie theater" as "a facility other than a drive-in theater that is used primarily for the purpose of showing movies to the public for a fee" in order to make clear which facilities are subject to the specific captioning and audio description requirements set forth in ยง 36.303(g). The Department intended this definition to exclude drive-in movie theaters as well as facilities that screen movies if the facility is not used primarily for the purpose of showing movies for a fee, such as museums, hotels, resorts, or cruise ships, even if they charge an additional fee. The Department asked for public comment on the proposed definition and whether it adequately described the movie theaters that should be covered by this regulation.

Commenters generally supported the Department's proposed definition for "movie theater," but there were some concerns about the proposed definition's scope. Some commenters asserted that the definition of "movie theater" should be expanded to include the institutions that the Department expressly excluded, such as museums, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, amusement parks, and other similar public accommodations that show movies as a secondary function, whether or not they charge a fee. One commenter expressed concern that such entities might believe that they are otherwise exempt from any requirement to furnish auxiliary aids and services to ensure effective communication, and another commenter urged the Department to consider developing additional regulations that would specifically address public accommodations that are not covered by the proposed definition but otherwise exhibit movies or other video content.
