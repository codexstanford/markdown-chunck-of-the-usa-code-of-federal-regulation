##### ยง 28.26 Exceptions based on the nature of the evidence.

Subsection (c)(4) of section 3600A provides that the section's biological evidence preservation requirement does not apply if "the evidence must be returned to its rightful owner, or is of such a size, bulk, or physical character as to render retention impracticable." This exception is subject to the condition that the Government must "take[] reasonable measures to remove and preserve portions of the material evidence sufficient to permit future DNA testing."
