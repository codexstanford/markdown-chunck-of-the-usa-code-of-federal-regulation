##### See,See

To be covered under the ADA, an individual must satisfy only one prong. The term "actual disability" is used in these rules of construction as shorthand terminology to refer to an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity within the meaning of the first prong of the definition of "disability."§§ 35.108(a)(1)(i); 36.105(a)(1)(i). The terminology selected is for ease of reference. It is not intended to suggest that an individual with a disability who is covered under the first prong has any greater rights under the ADA than an individual who is covered under the "record of" or "regarded as" prongs, with the exception that the ADA Amendments Act revised the ADA to expressly state that an individual who meets the definition of "disability" solely under the "regarded as" prong is not entitled to reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures.42 U.S.C. 12201(h).
