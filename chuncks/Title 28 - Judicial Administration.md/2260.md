####### Non-participating State.

(g)If a state notifies the Bureau of Justice Assistance of its intent not to apply for block grant funds or fails to submit an application by the submission date, the Bureau will announce the availability of the block grant funds to local units of government in the non-participating state and will invite them to submit applications directly to the Bureau. A unit of local government receiving a block grant award directly from the Bureau assumes responsibility for all activities which would normally be the responsibility of the State Office.
