The Department recognizes that a reservations system is not intended to be an accessibility survey. However, specific information concerning accessibility features is essential to travelers with disabilities. Because of the wide variations in the level of accessibility that travelers will encounter, the Department cannot specify what information must be included in every instance. For hotels that were built in compliance with the 1991 Standards, it may be sufficient to specify that the hotel is accessible and, for each accessible room, to describe the general type of room (deluxe executive suite), the size and number of beds (two queen beds), the type of accessible bathing facility (roll-in shower), and communications features available in the room (alarms and visual notification devices). Based on that information, many individuals with disabilities will be comfortable making reservations.
