(iii)Where the prisoner's behavior has shown that he may be affected by personality disorders or a mental illness that has hampered his ability to lead a law-abiding life, or that he may otherwise benefit from such programs, participation in psychological and/or other specialized programs which lead to a judgment by the therapist/counselor that the prisoner has significantly improved his ability to obey the law and favorably modified his value system.
