##### Retain term "service animal.",cf.,Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs,http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/hudclips/handbooks/hsgh/4350.3,See,et seq.; see also,Guidance Concerning Service Animals in Air Transportation,

Some commenters asserted that the term "assistance animal" is a term of art and should replace the term "service animal"; however, the majority of commenters preferred the term "service animal" because it is more specific. The Department has decided to retain the term "service animal" in the final rule. While some agencies, like HUD, use the terms "assistance animal," "assistive animal," or "support animal," these terms are used to denote a broader category of animals than is covered by the ADA. The Department has decided that changing the term used in the final rule would create confusion, particularly in view of the broader parameters for coverage under the FHAct,Preamble to HUD's Final Rule for Pet Ownership for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities, 73 FR 63834-38 (Oct. 27, 2008); HUD Handbook No. 4350.3 Rev-1, Chapter 2,(June 2007), available at(last visited June 24, 2010). Moreover, as discussed above, the Department's definition of "service animal" in the final rule does not affect the rights of individuals with disabilities who use assistance animals in their homes under the FHAct or who use "emotional support animals" that are covered under the ACAA and its implementing regulations.14 CFR 382.7Department of Transportation,68 FR 24874, 24877 (May 9, 2003) (discussing accommodation of service animals and emotional support animals on aircraft).
