### PART 72 - SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION
#### ยง 72.3 Applicability of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.
##### Example 2 to ยง 72.3.

A sex offender is convicted by a state jurisdiction in 1997 for molesting a child and is released following imprisonment in 2000. The sex offender initially registers as required but relocates to another state in 2009 and fails to register in the new state of residence. The sex offender has violated the requirement under SORNA to register in any jurisdiction in which he resides, and could be held criminally liable under 18 U.S.C. 2250 for the violation because he traveled in interstate commerce.
