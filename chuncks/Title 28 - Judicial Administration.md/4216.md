#### Subpart B - Nature of Coverage
##### ยง 55.8 Relationship between section 4(f)(4) and section 203(c).

(a) The statutory requirements of section 4(f)(4) and section 203(c) regarding minority language material and assistance are essentially identical.

(b) Jurisdictions subject to the requirements of section 4(f)(4)-but not jurisdictions subject only to the requirements of section 203(c)-are also subject to the Act's special provisions, such as section 5 (regarding preclearance of changes in voting laws) and section 8 (regarding federal observers).See part 51 of this chapter.

(c) Although the coverage formulas applicable to section 4(f)(4) and section 203(c) are different, a political subdivision may be included within both of the coverage formulas. Under these circumstances, a judgment terminating coverage of the jurisdiction under one provision would not have the effect of terminating coverage under the other provision.
