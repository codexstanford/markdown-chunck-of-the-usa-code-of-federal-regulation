Category IIE also applies when the current offense is felony unlawful possession of a firearm and there is no other current offense. Possession for purposes of Category IIE includes constructive possession.

(8) Category IIIA applies if the death of a victim is:

(i) Caused by the offender, or

(ii) Caused by an accomplice and the killing was planned or approved by the offender in furtherance of a joint criminal venture.
