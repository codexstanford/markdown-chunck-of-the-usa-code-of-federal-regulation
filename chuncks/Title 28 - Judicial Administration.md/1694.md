## Chapter I - Department of Justice
### PART 28 - DNA IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM
#### Subpart C - Preservation of Biological Evidence
##### ยง 28.26 Exceptions based on the nature of the evidence.
###### Evidence not retained beyond the investigative stage.,e.g.

(a)Section 3600A(c)(4) has no application if items of the sort it describes-, items that must be returned to the rightful owner, or items that are so large that their retention is impracticable-are not kept until the time when a defendant is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. Investigative agents may take samples from such items during the investigative stage of the case, in accordance with their judgment about what is needed for purposes of DNA testing or other evidentiary use, or may conclude that the nature of the items does not warrant taking such samples, and the items themselves may then be returned to the owners or otherwise disposed of prior to the trial, conviction, or sentencing of any defendant. In such cases, section 3600A is inapplicable, because its evidence preservation requirement does not apply at all until a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, as noted in ยง 28.22(b)(1).
