Many environment and Federal government employee commenters objected to the Department's proposed definition of "wheelchair" because it differed from the definition of "wheelchair" found in section 508(c)(2) of the ADA-a definition used in the statute only in connection with a provision relating to the use of a wheelchair in a designated wilderness area.42 U.S.C. 12207(c)(1). Other government commenters associated with environmental issues wanted the phrase "outdoor pedestrian use" eliminated from the definition of "wheelchair." Some transit system commenters wanted size, weight, and dimensions to be part of the definition because of concerns about costs associated with having to accommodate devices that exceed the dimensions of the "common wheelchair" upon which the 2004 ADAAG was based.
