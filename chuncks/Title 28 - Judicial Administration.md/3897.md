### PART 50 - STATEMENTS OF POLICY
#### ยง 50.10 Policy regarding obtaining information from or records of members of the news media; and regarding questioning, arresting, or charging members of the news media.
##### Filter protocols.

(o)(1) In conjunction with the use of compulsory legal process, the use of filter protocols, including but not limited to keyword searches and filter teams, may be necessary to minimize the potential intrusion into newsgathering-related materials that are unrelated to the conduct under investigation.

(2) While the use of filter protocols should be considered in all matters involving a member of the news media, the use of such protocols must be balanced against the need for prosecutorial flexibility and the recognition that investigations evolve, and should be tailored to the facts of each investigation.
