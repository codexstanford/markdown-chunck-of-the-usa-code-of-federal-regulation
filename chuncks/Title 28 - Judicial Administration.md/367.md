###### New criminal behavior in the community

(3)(e.g., while on pass, furlough, work release, or on escape). In such cases, the guidelines applicable to reparole violators under ยง 2.21 shall be applied, using the new offense severity (from ยง 2.20) and recalculated salient factor score (such score shall be recalculated as if the prisoner had been on parole at the time of the new criminal behavior). The time required pursuant to these guidelines shall be added to the time required by the original presumptive or effective date.

(b) The above are merely guidelines. Where the circumstances warrant, a decision outside the guidelines (above or below) may be rendered provided specific reasons are given. For example, a substantial period of good conduct since the last disciplinary infraction in cases not involving new criminal conduct may be treated as a mitigating circumstance.
