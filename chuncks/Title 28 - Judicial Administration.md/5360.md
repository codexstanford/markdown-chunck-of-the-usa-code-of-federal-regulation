###### Units of local governments.

(b)(1) Units of local government grantees may certify based on State or local law, policy, or regulation.

(2) In the event that a unit of local government does not have authority to prosecute "crime[s] in which by force or threat of force the perpetrator compels the victim to engage in sexual activity[,]" the unit of local government may submit a letter from an appropriate legal authority in the jurisdiction certifying that the jurisdiction does not have the authority to prosecute "crime[s] in which by force or threat of force the perpetrator compels the victim to engage in sexual activity" and that therefore the certification is not relevant to the unit of local government in question.
