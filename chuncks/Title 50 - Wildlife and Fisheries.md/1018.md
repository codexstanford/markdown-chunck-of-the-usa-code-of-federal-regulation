() Ignition tactics, rates of spread, and flame lengths should allow for wildlife escape routes to avoid trapping birds in a fire. The application of prescribed fire should avoid fires, such as ring and strip head fires, that have long, unbroken boundaries and/or that come together in a short period of time and that consume essentially all vegetation and prevent black rails from escaping a fire. If aerial ignition is the chosen tool, ignitions should be conducted in such a way that large, fast-moving fires are avoided.

(B) Mowing, haying, and other mechanical treatment activities in persistent emergent wetlands when the activity occurs during the nesting or brooding periods, except in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
