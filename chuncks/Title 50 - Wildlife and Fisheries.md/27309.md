###### Calculation.

(2)(i) To calculate the maximum retainable amount for a specific incidental catch species, an individual retainable amount must be calculated with respect to each basis species that is retained on board that vessel.

(ii) To obtain these individual retainable amounts, multiply the appropriate retainable percentage for the incidental catch species/basis species combination, set forth in Table 10 to this part for the GOA species categories (except the Rockfish Program fisheries, which are described in Table 30 to this part for the Rockfish Program fisheries), and Table 11 to this part for the BSAI species categories, by the amount of that basis species, in round-weight equivalents.

(iii) The maximum retainable amount for that specific incidental catch species is the sum of the individual retainable amount.
