###### Annual QS adjustments.

(i)On or about January 1 each year, QS permit owners will be notified, via the IFQ Web site and their QS account, of any adjustments to their QS and/or IBQ allocations, for each of the IFQ species. Updated QS and/or IBQ values, if applicable, will reflect the results of: any recalculation of initial allocation formulas resulting from changes in provisional OYs used in the allocation formulas or appeals, any redistribution of QS and IBQ (e.g., resulting from permanent revocation of applicable permits, subject to accumulation limits), and any transfers of QS and/or IBQ made during the prior year.
