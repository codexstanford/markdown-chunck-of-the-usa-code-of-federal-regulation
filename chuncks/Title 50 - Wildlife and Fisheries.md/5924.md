###### ยง 23.90 What are the criteria for listing species in Appendix III?
####### Removing a species from Appendix III.

(f)We will monitor the international trade in Appendix-III species listed by us and periodically evaluate whether each species continues to meet the listing criteria in paragraph (c) of this section. We will remove a species from Appendix III provided all of the following criteria are met:

(1) International trade in the species is very limited. As a general guide, we will consider removal when exports involve fewer than 5 shipments per year or fewer than 100 individual animals or plants.

(2) Legal and illegal trade in the species, including international trade or interstate commerce, is determined not to be a concern.
