(4) SWFSC must maintain visual monitoring effort during the entire period of time that purse seine gear is in the water (throughout gear deployment, fishing, and retrieval). If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully removed from the water, SWFSC must take the most appropriate action to avoid marine mammal interaction. SWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision.

(5) If purse seine operations have been suspended because of the presence of marine mammals, SWFSC may resume seine operations when practicable only when the animals are believed to have departed the area. SWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this determination.

(6) If any cetaceans are observed in a purse seine net, SWFSC must immediately open the net and free the animals.
