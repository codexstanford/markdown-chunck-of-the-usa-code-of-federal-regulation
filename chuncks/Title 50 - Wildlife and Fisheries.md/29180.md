tested with one small test load.

b. The field strength can be generated in various ways:

i. The strip line is used at low frequencies (below 30 MHz or in some cases 150 MHz) for small EUT's;

ii. The long wire is used at low frequencies (below 30 MHz) for larger EUT's;

iii. Dipole antennas or antennas with circular polarization placed 1 m from the EUT are used at high frequencies.

c. Under exposure to electromagnetic fields the EUT is again tested as indicated above.
