##### § 660.360 Recreational fishery - management measures.
###### Recreational rockfish conservation area (RCA).

(B)Fishing for groundfish with recreational gear is prohibited within the recreational RCA, a type of closed area or groundfish conservation area, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the recreational RCA, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession of any groundfish unless otherwise stated. [For example, if a vessel fishes in the recreational salmon fishery within the recreational RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of groundfish while within the recreational RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and retain groundfish shoreward of the recreational RCA on the return trip to port.] Off Oregon, from January 1 through December 31, recreational fishing for groundfish is allowed in all depths. Coordinates approximating boundary lines at the 10-fm (18-m) through 100-fm (183-m) depth contours can be found at § 660.71 through § 660.73.
