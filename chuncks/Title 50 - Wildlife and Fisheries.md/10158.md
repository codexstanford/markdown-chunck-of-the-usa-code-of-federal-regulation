####### Acoustic monitoring,Sound source verification.

(b)-(1)(i) The Navy shall conduct pile driving sound source verification for the following types and sizes of piles:

(A) Vibratory and impact installation of at least 5 16-in fiberglass reinforced plastic piles; and

(B) Rock socket drilling of at least 3 30-in and 3 16-in piles.

(ii) Sound source measurements of these piles sound shall be conducted at distances approximately 10 m from the source.

(iii) For vibratory pile driving/removal source level measurements, reports shall include 1-s sound exposure level (SEL), source spectrum, duration of recordings used to derived the SEL, and 24-hour cumulative SEL extrapolated from measurements.

(iv) For impact pile driving source level measurements, report should include peak sound pressure level (SPL), root-mean-square SPL (SPL), single strike SEL (SEL), integration time for SPL, SELspectrum, and 24-hour cumulative SEL extrapolated from measurements.
