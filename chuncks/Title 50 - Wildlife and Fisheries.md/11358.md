Information related to marine mammal interaction (animal captured or entangled in research gear) must include details of survey effort, full descriptions of any observations of the animals, the context (vessel and conditions), decisions made and rationale for decisions made in vessel and gear handling.

(ii) The NEFSC must submit annual reports. The period of reporting will be one year beginning at the date of issuance of the LOA.

(D) Summary information from the pinniped haulout censuses in the and summary information related to any disturbance of pinnipeds, including event-specific total counts of animals present, counts of reactions according to a three-point scale of response severity, and distance of closest approach;

(E) A written evaluation of the effectiveness of NEFSC mitigation strategies in reducing the number of marine mammal interactions with survey gear, including best professional judgment and suggestions for changes to the mitigation strategies, if any;

(F) Final outcome of serious injury determinations for all incidents of marine mammal interactions where the animal(s) were released alive; and

(G) A summary of all relevant training provided by the NEFSC and any coordination with the NMFS Southeast Fishery Science Center, the Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office, and the Southeast Regional Office.

(iii) Reporting of North Atlantic right whales and injured or dead marine mammals:

(A) In the event that the NEFSC observes a North Atlantic right whale during a survey, they must report the sighting as soon as possible to 866-755-6622 if the sighting occurs in the Northeast region (VA to ME) or to 877-WHALE-HELP if the sighting occurs in the Southeast region (FL to NC).
