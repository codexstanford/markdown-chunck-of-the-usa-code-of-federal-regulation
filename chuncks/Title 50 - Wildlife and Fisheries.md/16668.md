### PART 600 - MAGNUSON-STEVENS ACT PROVISIONS
#### Subpart K - EFH Coordination, Consultation, and Recommendations
##### ยง 600.930 Council comments and recommendations to Federal and state agencies.
###### Establishment of procedures.

(a)Each Council should establish procedures for reviewing Federal or state actions that may adversely affect the habitat, including EFH, of a species under its authority. Each Council may receive information on actions of concern by methods such as directing Council staff to track proposed actions, recommending that the Council's habitat committee identify actions of concern, or entering into an agreement with NMFS to have the appropriate Regional Administrator notify the Council of actions of concern that would adversely affect EFH. Federal and state actions often follow specific timetables which may not coincide with Council meetings. Therefore, Councils should consider establishing abbreviated procedures for the development of Council recommendations.
