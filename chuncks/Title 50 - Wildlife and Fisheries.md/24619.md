(1) The KRFC control rule uses reference points FMSST, S, and two levels ofexploitation rates, F = 0.10 and F = 0.25. The maximum allowable exploitation rate, F, in a given year, depends on the pre-fishery ocean abundance in spawner equivalent units, N. At high abundance, the control rule caps the exploitation rate at Fat moderate abundance, the control rule specifies an F that results in Sspawners; and at low abundance (when expected escapement is below S), the control rule allows forexploitation rates with the abundance breakpoints defined as: A = MSST/2; B = (MSST + S)/2; C = S/(1-0.25); D = S/(1-F), as shown in Figure 1 of subpart H of this part. For N between 0 and A, F increases linearly from 0 at N = 0, to 0.10 at N = A. For N between A and MSST, F is equal to 0.10. For N between MSST and B, F increases linearly from 0.10 at N = MSST, to 0.25 at N = B. For N between B and C, F is equal to 0.25. For N between C and D, F is the value that results in Sspawners. For N greater than D, F is equal to F
