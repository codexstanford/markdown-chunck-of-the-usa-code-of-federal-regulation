####### When and how will the Service inform the public of additional restrictions in trade of vicu&#xF1;a?

(3)Except in rare cases involving extenuating circumstances that do not adversely affect the conservation of the species, we will issue a public bulletin that identifies a restriction on trade in specimens of vicu&#xF1;a addressed in this paragraph (m) if any of the following criteria are met:

(i) The country is identified in any action adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the Convention's Standing Committee, or in a Notification issued by the CITES Secretariat, whereby Parties are asked not to accept shipments of specimens of any CITES-listed species from the country in question.

(ii) The Service's Division of Scientific Authority administratively determines that the conservation or management status of threatened vicu&#xF1;a populations in a range country has changed, such that continued recovery of the vicu&#xF1;a population in that country may be compromised, as a result of one or more of the following factors:

(A) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens protection for vicu&#xF1;a;

(B) A change in range country management programs that lessens protection for vicu&#xF1;a;

(C) A documented decline in wild vicu&#xF1;a population numbers;

(D) A documented increase in poaching of vicu&#xF1;a;

(E) A documented decline in vicu&#xF1;a habitat quality or quantity; or

(F) Other natural or man-made factors affecting the species' recovery.
