(4) The Service will monitor the implementation of the NCCP Conservation and Process Guidelines as a whole, and will conduct a review every 6 months to determine whether the guidelines, as implemented, are effective in progressing toward or meeting regional and subregional conservation objectives during the interim planning period. If the Service determines that the guidelines are not effecting adequate progress toward or meeting regional and subregional conservation objectives, the Service will consult with the California Department of Fish and Game pursuant to the MOU to seek appropriate modification of the guidelines or their application as defined therein. If appropriate modification of the guidelines or their application as defined therein does not occur, the Service may revoke the interim take provisions of this special rule on a subregional or subarea basis. The Service will publish the findings for revocation in theand provide for a 30-day public comment period prior to the effective date for revoking the provisions of the special rule in a particular area.
