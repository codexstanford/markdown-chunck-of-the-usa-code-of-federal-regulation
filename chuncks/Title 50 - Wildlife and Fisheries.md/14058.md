######## ยง 260.97 Conditions for providing fishery products inspection service at official establishments.

(a) The determination as to the inspection effort required to adequately provide inspection service at any establishment will be made by NMFS. The man-hours required may vary at different official establishments due to factors such as, but not limited to, size and complexity of operations, volume and variety of products produced, and adequacy of control systems and cooperation. The inspection effort requirement may be reevaluated when the contracting party or NMFS deems there is sufficient change in production, equipment and change of quality control input to warrant reevaluation. Inspectors will not be available to perform any of employee or management duties, however, they will be available for consultation purposes. NMFS reserves the right to reassign inspectors as it deems necessary.

(b) NMFS shall not be held responsible:

(1) For damages occurring through any act of commission or omission on the part of its inspectors when engaged in performing services; or

(2) For production errors, such as processing temperatures, length of process, or misbranding of products; or

(3) For failure to supply enough inspection effort during any period of service.

(c) The contracting party will:

(1) Use only wholesome raw material which has been handled or stored under sanitary conditions and is suitable for processings; maintain the official establishment(s), designated on the contract in such sanitary condition and to employ such methods of handling raw materials for processing as may be necessary to conform to the sanitary requirements precribed or approved by NMFS;

(2) Adequately code each primary container and master case of products sold or otherwise distributed from a manufacturing, processing, packing, or repackaging activity to enable positive lot identification to facilitate, where necessary, the segregation of specific food lots that may have become contaminated or otherwise unfit for their intended use;

(3) Not permit any labels on which reference is made to Federal inspection, to be used on any product which is not packed under fishery products inspection service nor permit any labels on which reference is made to any U.S. Grade to be used on any product which has not been officially certified as meeting the requirements of such grade; nor supply labels bearing reference to Federal inspection to another establishment unless the products to which such labels are to be applied have been packed under Federal inspection at an official establishment;

(4) Not affix any label on which reference is made to Federal inspection to any container of processed foods, produced in any designated official establishment, with respect to which the grade of such product is not certified because of adulteration due to the presence of contaminants in excess of limits established in accordance with the regulations or guidelines issued pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended;
