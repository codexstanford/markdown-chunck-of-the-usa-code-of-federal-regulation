###### Adjustment of GOM shares to match the GOM share cap.

(ii)If NMFS determines that the total amount of GOM-designated IBQ shares would be greater than the GOM share cap (default or adjusted), NMFS will reduce the total amount of GOM shares in order to equal the GOM share cap. The reduction in total GOM shares will be achieved through equal proportional reductions among all GOM shareholders. The ATL shares will be increased in an analogous manner, so that the total share percentages for the two regions add up to 100 percent. NMFS will notify affected shareholders of any reductions in their GOM shares or increases in ATL shares resulting from this adjustment. This adjustment is not subject to appeal under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
