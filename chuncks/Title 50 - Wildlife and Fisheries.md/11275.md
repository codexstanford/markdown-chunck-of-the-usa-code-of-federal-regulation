####### Pre-event awareness notifications in the Temporary Maritime Activities Area.

(iii)The Navy must issue pre-event awareness messages to alert vessels and aircraft participating in training activities within the TMAA to the possible presence of concentrations of large whales on the continental shelf and slope. Occurrences of large whales may be higher over the continental shelf and slope relative to other areas of the TMAA. Large whale species in the TMAA include, but are not limited to, fin whale, blue whale, humpback whale, gray whale, North Pacific right whale, sei whale, and sperm whale. To maintain safety of navigation and to avoid interactions with marine mammals, the Navy must instruct personnel to remain vigilant to the presence of large whales that may be vulnerable to vessel strikes or potential impacts from training activities. Additionally, Navy personnel must use the information from the awareness notification messages to assist their visual observation of applicable mitigation zones during training activities and to aid in the implementation of procedural mitigation.
