(ii)Section 303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act applies "unless otherwise provided for under an international agreement in which the United States participates" (Pub. L. 109-479 104(b)(1)). This exception applies to stocks or stock complexes subject to management under an international agreement, which is defined as "any bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, or agreement which relates to fishing and to which the United States is a party" (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 3(24)). These stocks would still need to have SDC, MSY, and OY.
