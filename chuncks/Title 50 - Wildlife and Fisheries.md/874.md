####### Antique ivory.,et seq.

(9)Antiques (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) are not subject to the provisions of this rule. Antiques containing or consisting of ivory may, therefore, be imported into or exported from the United States without a threatened species permit issued under ยง 17.32, provided the requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23 have been met. Nevertheless, nothing in this rule interprets or changes any provisions or prohibitions that may apply under the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 4201), regardless of the age of the item. Antiques that consist of or contain raw or worked ivory may similarly be sold or offered for sale in interstate or foreign commerce and delivered, received, carried, transported, or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity without a threatened species permit issued under ยง 17.32.
