means items made by an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo that (a) are composed wholly or in some significant respect of natural materials and (b) are significantly altered from their natural form and are produced, decorated, or fashioned in the exercise of traditional native handicrafts without the use of pantographs, multiple carvers, or similar mass-copying devices. Improved methods of production utilizing modern implements such as sewing machines or modern techniques at a tannery registered pursuant to ยง 18.23(c) may be used so long as no large-scale mass-production industry results.

The formation of traditional native groups, such as cooperatives, is permitted so long as no large-scale mass production results.
