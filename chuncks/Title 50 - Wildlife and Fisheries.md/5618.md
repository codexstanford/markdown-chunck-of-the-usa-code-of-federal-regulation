###### § 23.20 What CITES documents are required for international trade?
####### Introduction-from-the-sea certificates.

(f)For introduction from the sea of Appendix-I or Appendix-II specimens, you must obtain an introduction-from-the-sea certificate before conducting the proposed activity, unless the exemption in paragraph (d)(10) of this section applies (see § 23.39). The export of a specimen that was previously introduced from the sea will be treated as an export (see § 23.36 for export, § 23.36(e) and § 23.39(e) for export of exempt specimens, or § 23.37 for re-export). Although an Appendix-III specimen does not require a CITES document to be introduced from the sea, the subsequent international trade of the specimen would be considered an export. For export of an Appendix-III specimen that was introduced from the sea you must obtain an export permit (§ 23.36) if the export is from the country that listed the species in Appendix III, a certificate of origin (§ 23.38) if the export is from a country other than the listing country, or a re-export certificate for all re-exports (§ 23.37).
