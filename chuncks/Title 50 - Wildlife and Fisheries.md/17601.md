###### Venting tool.

(2)A venting tool is a device capable of penetrating the abdomen of a fish to release the excess gases accumulated in the body cavity when a fish is retrieved from depth. A venting tool must be a sharpened, hollow instrument that allows air to escape, such as a hypodermic syringe with the plunger removed. A 16-gauge needle, which has an outside diameter of 0.065 inches (1.65 mm), is the minimum diameter hollow tube that must be used. A larger diameter hollow needle is preferred to allow more air to escape from a fish rapidly. A device that is not hollow, such as a knife or an ice pick, is not a venting tool and will cause additional damage to a fish.
