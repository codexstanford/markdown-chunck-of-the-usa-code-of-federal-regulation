##### ยง 680.40 Crab Quota Share (QS), Processor QS (PQS), Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ), and Individual Processor Quota (IPQ) Issuance.
###### Class A/B IFQ issuance ratio.

(3)(i) Class A and Class B IFQ shall be assigned on an annual basis such that the total amount of Class A and B IFQ assigned in a crab fishing year in each crab QS fishery for each region will be in a ratio of 90 percent Class A IFQ and 10 percent Class B IFQ.

(ii) The Regional Administrator will determine the amount of Class A and Class B IFQ that is assigned to each QS holder. The Class A IFQ is calculated by allocating 90 percent of the Class A/B IFQ TAC (TAC a) to Class A IFQ. A portion of the IFQ TAC a is allocated to persons eligible to hold only Class A IFQ (TAC a only), the remaining IFQ TAC (TAC r) is allocated for harvest by a person (p) eligible to receive both Class A IFQ and Class B IFQ. Expressed algebraically, for an individual person (p) eligible to hold both Class A and Class B IFQ the annual allocation formula is as follows:

(A) TAC= Class A/B IFQ TAC x 0.90

(B) TAC= TAC-TAC

(C) IFQ= TAC/(Class A/B IFQ TAC-TAC) x IFQ

(D) IFQ= IFQ-IFQ
