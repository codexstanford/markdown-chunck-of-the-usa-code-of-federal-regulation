####### Additional information on the practice of falconry,Raptors removed from the wild for falconry are always considered "wild" raptors.

(f)-(1)No matter how long such a bird is held in captivity or whether it is transferred to another permittee or permit type, it is always considered a "wild" bird. However, it is considered to be taken from the wild only by the person who originally captured it. We do not consider the raptor to be taken from the wild by any subsequent permittee to whom it is legally transferred.
