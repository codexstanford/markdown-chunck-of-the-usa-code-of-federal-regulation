###### ยง 86.90 How much must an operator of a BIG-funded facility charge for using the facility?

(a) An operator of a BIG-funded facility must charge reasonable fees for using the facility based on prevailing rates at other publicly and privately owned local facilities similarly situated and offering a similar service or amenity.

(b) If other publicly and privately owned local facilities offer BIG-funded services or amenities free of charge, then a fee is not required.

(c) If the BIG-funded facility has a State or locally imposed fee structure, we will accept the mandated fee structure if it is reasonable and does not impose an undue burden on eligible users.

(d) You must state proposed fees and the basis for the fees in your grant application. The information you give may be in any format that clearly shows how you arrived at an equitable amount.
