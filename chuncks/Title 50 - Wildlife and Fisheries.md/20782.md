(ii)The APL shall be equal to the combined projected landings by the limited access and LAGC IFQ, in open areas, access areas, and Northern Gulf of Maine management area after set-asides (RSA, NGOM, and observer) and incidental landings are accounted for, for a given fishing year. Projected scallop landings are calculated by estimating the landings that will come from open area, access area, and Northern Gulf of Maine effort combined for both limited access and LAGC IFQ fleets. These projected landings shall not exceed the overall ABC/ACL and ACT, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
