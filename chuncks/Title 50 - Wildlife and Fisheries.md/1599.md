####### Where are these mollusks designated as nonessential experimental populations (NEPs)?

(1)(i) The NEP Area for these 17 mollusks is within the species' historic ranges, and is defined as follows: The free-flowing reach of the Tennessee River from the base of Wilson Dam downstream to the backwaters of Pickwick Reservoir (river mile (RM) 259.4 [414.0 km] to RM 246.0 [393.6 km] and includes the lower 5 RM (8 km) of all tributaries to this reach in Colbert and Lauderdale Counties, Alabama.

(ii) None of the identified species are known to exist in any of the tributaries to the free-flowing reach of the Tennessee River below Wilson Dam or from below the backwaters of Pickwick Reservoir, Colbert and Lauderdale Counties, Alabama. In the future, if any of the 17 mollusks are found upstream of the lower 5 RM (8 km) of these tributaries or downstream into Pickwick Reservoir, we will presume the animals came from the reintroduced NEP, and we will amend this rule and enlarge the boundaries of the NEP Area to include the entire range of the expanded population.

(iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to "essential experimental," "threatened," or "endangered" within the NEP Area. Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
