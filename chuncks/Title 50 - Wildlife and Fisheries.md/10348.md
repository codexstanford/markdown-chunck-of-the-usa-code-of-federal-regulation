###### ยง 217.185 Requirements for monitoring and reporting.
####### Data collection.

(c)PSOs must use standardized electronic data forms. PSOs must record detailed information about any implementation of mitigation requirements, including the distance of marine mammals to the acoustic source and description of specific actions that ensued, the behavior of the animal(s), any observed changes in behavior before and after implementation of mitigation, and if shutdown was implemented, the length of time before any subsequent ramp-up or activation of the acoustic source. If required mitigation was not implemented, PSOs must record a description of the circumstances. At a minimum, the following information should be recorded:

(1) Vessel names (source vessel and other vessels associated with survey), vessel size and type, maximum speed capability of vessel, port of origin, and call signs;

(2) PSO names and affiliations;

(3) Dates of departures and returns to port with port name;

(4) Dates of and participants in PSO briefings;

(5) Dates and times (Greenwich Mean Time) of survey effort and times corresponding with PSO effort;

(6) Vessel location (latitude/longitude) when survey effort began and ended and vessel location at beginning and end of visual PSO duty shifts;

(7) Vessel location at 30-second intervals (if software capability allows) or 5-minute intervals (if location must be manually recorded);

(8) Vessel heading and speed at beginning and end of visual PSO duty shifts and upon any line change;

(9) Environmental conditions while on visual survey (at beginning and end of PSO shift and whenever conditions changed significantly), including Beaufort sea state and any other relevant weather conditions including cloud cover, fog, sun glare, and overall visibility to the horizon;

(10) Vessel location when environmental conditions change significantly;
