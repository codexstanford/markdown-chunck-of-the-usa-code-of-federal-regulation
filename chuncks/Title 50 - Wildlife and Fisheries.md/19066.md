###### Standardized reference grid.

(7)The vessel must have a standardized grid on deck in view of the haulback station camera(s) in such a way that the video recording includes an image of each fish on the grid in order to provide a size reference. The standardized grid may be on a removable mat or carpet that is placed on the deck before the fish are brought on board, or may be painted directly on the deck. The standardized reference grid must have accurate dimensions and grid line intervals as instructed and specified in the vessel's VMP by NMFS or the NMFS-approved contractor. The vessel owner and/or operator is responsible for ensuring compliance with the provided instructions and specifications and for ensuring accurate, straight, clear and complete grid lines with no missing, incomplete, blurry or smudged lines.
