####### U.S. and foreign general provisions.

(b)The following provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of a certificate of ownership for frequent international travel with live wildlife for personal use:

(1) The certificate must be obtained from the Management Authority in the country of the owner's primary residence.

(2) Parties should treat the certificate like a passport for import to and export or re-export from each country and should not collect the original certificate at the border.

(3) If offspring are born or an additional specimen is acquired while the owner is outside his or her country of primary residence, the owner must obtain the appropriate CITES document for the export or re-export of the wildlife, not a certificate of ownership, from the Management Authority of that country.

(4) Upon returning home, the owner may apply for a certificate of ownership for wildlife born or acquired overseas.
