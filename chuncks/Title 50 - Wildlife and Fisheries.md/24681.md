###### Initial qualification.

(b)(1) A limited entry permit for a vessel will be issued only if that vessel landed 100 mt of CPS finfish from January 1, 1993, through November 5, 1997.

(2) A limited entry permit will be issued only to the current owner of the vessel, unless:

(i) The previous owner of a vessel qualifying for a permit, by the express terms of a written contract, reserved the right to the limited entry permit, in which case the limited entry permit will be issued to the previous owner based on the catch history of the qualifying vessel, or

(ii) A vessel that would have qualified for a limited entry permit was totally lost prior to issuance of a limited entry permit. In this case, the owner of the vessel at the time it was lost retains the right to a permit for a replacement vessel, unless the owner conveyed the right to another person by the express terms of a written contract. The lost vessel must be replaced within 2 years of the date that the qualifying vessel was lost, and the replaced vessel must be of equal or less net tonnage.
