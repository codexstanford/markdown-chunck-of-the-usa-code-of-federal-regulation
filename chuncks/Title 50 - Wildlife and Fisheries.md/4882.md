###### ยง 18.137 Mitigation.
####### Mitigation measures for aircraft activities.

(e)(1) Aircraft must maintain a minimum altitude of 305 m (1,000 ft) to avoid unnecessary harassment of sea otters, except during takeoff and landing, and when a lower flight altitude is necessary for safety due to weather or restricted visibility.

(2) Aircraft must not be operated in such a way as to separate members of a group of sea otters from other members of the group.

(3) All aircraft must avoid areas of active or anticipated subsistence hunting for sea otters as determined through community consultations.

(4) Unmanned aerial systems or drones must not cause take by harassment of sea otters. Measures for avoidance of take may be required in an LOA, and may include maintaining a minimum altitude and horizontal distance no less than 100 m away from otters, conducting continuous visual monitoring by PSOs, and ceasing activities in response to sea otter behaviors indicating any reaction to drones.
