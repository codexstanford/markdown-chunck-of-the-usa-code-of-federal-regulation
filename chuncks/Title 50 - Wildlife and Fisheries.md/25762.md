###### Fish product weight

means the weight of the fish product in pounds or to at least the nearest thousandth of a metric ton (0.001 mt). Fish product weight is based upon the number of production units and the weight of those units. Production units include pans, cartons, blocks, trays, cans, bags, and individual fresh or frozen fish. The weight of a production unit is the average weight of representative samples of the product, and, for fish other than fresh fish, may include additives or water but not packaging. Any allowance for water added cannot exceed 5 percent of the gross product weight (fish, additives, and water).
