####### Sport fishing.

(4)We allow saltwater sport fishing year-round on designated areas of the refuge subject to the following conditions:

(i) We close a 300-foot (90-meter (m)) buffer zone beginning at mean high tide line and extending into the waters around Snake Key to all public entry from March 1 through June 30 to protect nesting birds.

(ii) We conditionally open to public entry a 300-foot (90-m) buffer zone beginning at mean high tide line and extending into the waters around Seahorse Key from March 1 through June 30. Should birds nest in that area during that timeframe, we will close that area of Seahorse Key to public entry.
