###### Unsorted codend

is a codend of groundfish that is not brought on board a catcher vessel and that is delivered to a mothership, shoreside processor, or stationary floating processor without the potential for sorting. No other instance of catcher vessel harvest is considered an "unsorted codend." All other catch that does not meet this definition is considered "presorted" whether or not sorting occurs.
