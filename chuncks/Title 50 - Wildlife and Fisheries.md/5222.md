####### Use of raptors held under a falconry permit in captive propagation.

(7)You may use raptors you possess for falconry in captive propagation if you or the person overseeing the propagation has the necessary permit(s) (see ยง 21.85). You do not need to transfer a bird from your falconry permit if you use it for fewer than 8 months in a year in captive propagation, but you must do so if you permanently transfer the bird for propagation. The bird must then be banded as required in ยง 21.85.
