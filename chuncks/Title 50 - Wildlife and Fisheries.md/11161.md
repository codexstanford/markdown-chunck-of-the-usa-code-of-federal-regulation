###### ยง 218.145 Requirements for monitoring and reporting.
####### Annual NWTT Study Area marine species monitoring report.

(d)The Navy must submit an annual report of the NWTT Study Area monitoring, which will be included in a Pacific-wide monitoring report including results specific to the NWTT Study Area, describing the implementation and results from the previous calendar year. Data collection methods must be standardized across Pacific Range Complexes including the Mariana Islands Training and Testing (MITT), Hawaii-Southern California Training and Testing (HSTT), NWTT, and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) Study Areas to allow for comparison in different geographic locations. The report must be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, either within three months after the end of the calendar year, or within three months after the conclusion of the monitoring year, to be determined by the adaptive management process. NMFS will submit comments or questions on the report, if any, within three months of receipt. The report will be considered final after the Navy has addressed NMFS' comments, or three months after submittal of the draft if NMFS does not provide comments on the draft report. This report will describe progress of knowledge made with respect to intermediate scientific objectives within the NWTT Study Area associated with the Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring Program (ICMP). Similar study questions must be treated together so that progress on each topic can be summarized across all Navy ranges. The report need not include analyses and content that does not provide direct assessment of cumulative progress on the monitoring plan study questions. This will continue to allow the Navy to provide a cohesive monitoring report covering multiple ranges (as per ICMP goals), rather than entirely separate reports for the NWTT, HSTT, GOA, and MITT Study Areas.
