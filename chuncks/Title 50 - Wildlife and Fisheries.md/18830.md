##### Hook removal device.

(a)The dehooker must be constructed of-inch (4.8-mm) to-inch (7.9-mm) diameter 316L or 304L stainless steel and have a dehooking end no larger than 1inches (4.8 cm) outside diameter. The dehooker must securely engage and control the leader while shielding the point to prevent the hook from re-engaging during removal. It may not have any unprotected terminal points (including blunt ones), as these could cause injury to the esophagus during hook removal. The dehooker must be of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used on the vessel.
