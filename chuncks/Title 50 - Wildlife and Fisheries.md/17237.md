(iv)A Council must address how data resulting from the standardized reporting methodology are used to assess the amount and type of bycatch occurring in the fishery. A Council must consult with its scientific and statistical committee and/or the regional National Marine Fisheries Service science center on reporting methodology design considerations such as data elements, sampling designs, sample sizes, and reporting frequency. The Council must also consider the scientific methods and techniques available to collect, record, and report bycatch data that could improve the quality of bycatch estimates. Different standardized reporting methodology designs may be appropriate for different fisheries.
