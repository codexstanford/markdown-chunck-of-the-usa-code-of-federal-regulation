###### 3,Area line movement.

()When a management area boundary line is moved for an IFQ species, the QS or IBQ held by individuals in each area will be adjusted proportionally such that they each maintain their same share of the trawl allocation on a coastwide basis (a fishing area may expand or decrease, but the individual's QP or IBQ pounds for both areas combined wouldn't change because of the change in areas). In order to achieve this end, the holders of QS or IBQ in the area being reduced will receive QS or IBQ for the area being expanded, such that the total QP or IBQ pounds they would be issued will not be reduced as a result of the area reduction. Those holding QS or IBQ in the area being expanded will have their QS or IBQ reduced such that the total QP or IBQ pounds they receive in the year of the line movement will not increase as a result of the expansion (nor will it be reduced).
