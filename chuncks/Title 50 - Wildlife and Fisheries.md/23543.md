###### Appeals.

(x)For QS permits and QS/IBQ issued under this section, the appeals process and timelines are specified at ยง 660.25(g), subpart C. For the initial issuance of QS/IBQ and the QS permits, the bases for appeal are described in paragraph (d)(8)(vi) of this section. An additional basis for appeal for whiting QS based on shoreside processing is an allegation that the shoreside processor or Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver to which a QS permit and whiting QS have been assigned was not in fact the first processor of the fish included in the qualifying landings history. The appellant must submit credible information supporting the allegation that they were in fact the first shoreside processor for the fish in question. Items not subject to appeal include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of permit landings data or Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver landings data in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010.
