(c)Persons aboard a vessel issued an HMS Charter/Headboat permit may retain and land BFT under the daily limits and quotas applicable to the Angling category or the General category as follows:

(1) When fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, the restrictions and retention limits applicable to the Angling category specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply.

(2) When fishing other than in the Gulf of Mexico when the fishery for the General category is closed or on an RFD, the restrictions and retention limits applicable to the Angling category specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section apply.

(3) When fishing other than in the Gulf of Mexico when the General category fishery is open and not on an RFD, a person aboard a vessel that has been issued an HMS Charter/Headboat permit with a commercial sale endorsement may fish under either the General category restrictions and retention limits as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section or the Angling category restrictions and retention limits as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The size category of the first BFT retained will determine whether the General category or Angling category restrictions and retention limits apply to the vessel that day.

(4) When fishing other than in the Gulf of Mexico when the General category fishery is open and not on an RFD, a person aboard a vessel that has been issued an HMS Charter/Headboat permit without a commercial sale endorsement permit may only fish for, possess, retain, or land BFT under the Angling category restrictions and retention limits as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
