###### § 217.95 Requirements for monitoring and reporting.
####### Acoustic monitoring.

(b)AGDC must conduct a sound source verification (SSV) in accordance with the requirements in the LOA, at the beginning of the pile driving to characterize the sound levels associated with different pile and hammer types, as well as to establish the marine mammal monitoring and mitigation zones.

(1) A minimum of 2 piles of each type and size must be measured.

(2) The following data, at minimum, shall be collected during acoustic monitoring and reported:

(i) Hydrophone equipment and methods: Recording device, sampling rate, distance from the pile where recordings were made; depth of recording device(s);

(ii) Type of pile being driven and method of driving during recordings; and

(iii) Mean, median, and maximum sound levels (dB re: 1µPa): Cumulative sound exposure level (SEL), peak sound pressure level (SPL), root mean square sound pressure level (SPL), and single-strike sound exposure level (SEL).

(3) An SSV report must be submitted to NMFS within 72 hours after field measurements for approval of the results.

(4) The results of the SSV report may be used to adjust the extent of Level A and Level B harassment zones in-water pile driving.
