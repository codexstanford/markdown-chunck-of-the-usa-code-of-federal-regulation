####### U.S. and foreign general provisions.

(b)The following provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of export permits for Appendix-I specimens artificially propagated for commercial purposes:

(1) An Appendix-I specimen may not be imported for purposes of establishing or augmenting a nursery or commercial propagating operation, unless the specimen is pre-Convention (see ยง 23.45) or was propagated at a nursery that is registered with the CITES Secretariat or a commercial propagating operation that qualifies under paragraph (d) of this section, and the CITES document indicates the source code as "D."

(2) An export permit may be issued to a CITES-registered nursery, to a commercial propagating operation that qualifies under paragraph (d) of this section, or to persons who have acquired a specimen that originated at such a nursery or operation. No CITES import permit is required for a qualifying specimen.

(3) The export permit, and any subsequent re-export certificate, must show the specimen as listed in Appendix I and the source code as "D," and if from a nursery registered with the Secretariat, give the identification number of the registered nursery where the specimen originated.
