###### Open access allocation.,i.e.,

(ii)The allocation for the open access fishery is derived by applying the open access allocation percentage to the annual commercial harvest guideline or quota plus the non-groundfish fishery (incidental open access fishery) amount described in paragraph (b) of this section. The result is the total open access allocation. The portion that is set-aside for the non-groundfish fisheries is deducted and the remainder is the directed open access portion. For management areas or stocks for which quotas or harvest guidelines for a stock are not fully utilized, no separate allocation will be established for the open access fishery until it is projected that the allowable catch for a species will be reached.
