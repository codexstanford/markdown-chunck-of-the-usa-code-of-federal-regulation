####### Trawl survey protocols.

(b)(1) NEFSC must conduct trawl operations as soon as is practicable upon arrival at the sampling station;

(2) NEFSC must initiate marine mammal watches (visual observation) 15 minutes prior to sampling within 1 nm of the site. Marine mammal watches must be conducted by scanning the surrounding waters with the naked eye and binoculars (or monocular). During nighttime operations, visual observation will be conducted using the naked eye and available vessel lighting;

(3) NEFSC must implement the following "move-on rule." If a marine mammal is sighted within 1 nautical mile (nm) of the planned location in the 15 minutes before gear deployment, NEFSC may move the vessel away from the marine mammal to a different section of the sampling area if the animal appears to be at risk of interaction with the gear based on best professional judgement. If, after moving on, marine mammals are still visible from the vessel, NEFSC may decide to move again or to skip the station. NMFS may use best professional judgement in making this decision;
