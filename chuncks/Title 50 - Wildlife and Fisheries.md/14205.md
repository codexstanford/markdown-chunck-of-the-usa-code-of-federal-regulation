(e)(1) An award will be reduced to the extent that the loss or damage was caused by the negligence or fault of the claimant.

If the same claimant were responsible for 99% of the negligence or fault that caused the damage, the claimant would receive $100 in compensation).

(2) Negligence of the owner or operator of the fishing vessel or gear will reduce crewmember awards to the same extent that it reduces an award to the vessel's owner or operator.
