##### ยง 622.21 Individual fishing quota (IFQ) program for Gulf red snapper.
###### IFQ allocation.

(4)IFQ allocation is the amount of Gulf red snapper, in pounds gutted weight, an IFQ shareholder or allocation holder is authorized to possess, land, or sell during a given fishing year. IFQ allocation is derived at the beginning of each year by multiplying a shareholder's IFQ share times the annual commercial quota for Gulf red snapper. If the quota is increased after the beginning of the fishing year, then IFQ allocation is derived by multiplying a shareholder's IFQ share at the time of the quota increase by the amount the annual commercial quota for red snapper is increased. If a reduction in the commercial quota specified in ยง 622.39(a)(1)(i) is expected to occur after January 1, the beginning of the fishing year, but before June 1 in that same fishing year, NMFS will withhold distribution of IFQ allocation on January 1 in the amount equal to that reduction. If a final rule to implement the commercial quota reduction is not published in theand effective by June 1, NMFS will distribute withheld IFQ allocation of red snapper commercial quota to current shareholders based on shareholdings on the date the withheld IFQ allocation is distributed.
