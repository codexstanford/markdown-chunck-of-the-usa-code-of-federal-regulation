###### Initial administrative determinations (IAD).

(B)The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to an individual submitting an application for a hired master submitted in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(6), and (i)(7) of this section if the Regional Administrator determines that the information required to be submitted to NMFS is deficient or if the applicant fails to submit the required information. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information submitted. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal under the appeals procedures set out at ยง 679.43.

(v) Upon request by the Regional Administrator or an authorized officer, a person must submit additional written documentation necessary to establish the required minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel during the 12-month period previous to the application by the individual for a hired master permit.

(2) Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to any individual who received an initial allocation of QS assigned to category B, C, or D and who, prior to April 17, 1997, employed a master to fish any of the IFQ issued to that individual, provided the individual continues to own the vessel from which the IFQ is being fished at no lesser percentage of ownership interest than that held on April 17, 1997, and provided that this individual has not acquired additional QS through transfer after September 23, 1997.

(3) Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to individuals who received an initial allocation of QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory Area 2C or for sablefish QS in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140&#xB0; W. long., and this exemption is not transferable.

For purposes of this paragraph, an individual's interest in a vessel is determined by the percentage ownership by the individual of a corporation, partnership, association or other non-individual entity that has an ownership interest in the vessel multiplied by the percentage of ownership of the vessel by the corporation, partnership, or other non-individual entity.

(5) IFQ derived from QS held by a CQE must be used only by the individual whose IFQ permit account contains the resulting IFQ.

(i) The loss or irreparable damage to the vessel was caused by an act of God, an act of war, a collision, an act or omission of a party other than the individual or agent of the individual, or any other event not caused by the willful misconduct of the individual or agent of the individual.

(ii) The lost or irreparably damaged vessel is a commercial fishing vessel that was previously used to harvest halibut IFQ or sablefish IFQ of the individual who qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;

(iii) As part of the application for exemption, the individual submits to NMFS a copy of the USCG Form 2692 submitted to the USCG as specified in 46 CFR 4.05; and

(iv) The individual is applying to use a hired master on a vessel in which the individual has a minimum 20-percent ownership interest as of the date of the application by the individual for a hired master permit.

(7) In the event of temporary disablement of a vessel owned by an individual who qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the individual may remain exempt under paragraph (i)(1) of this section until December 31 of the year following the year in which the vessel was disabled, provided that the individual meets the following requirements:

(i) The temporary disablement of the vessel results from repairs required by an accident that materially and adversely affected the vessel's seaworthiness or fitness for service, such as from sinking, grounding, or fire;

(ii) The repairs from the accident require at least 60 days to be completed;

(iii) The disabled vessel is a commercial fishing vessel that was previously used to harvest halibut IFQ or sablefish IFQ of the individual who qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;
