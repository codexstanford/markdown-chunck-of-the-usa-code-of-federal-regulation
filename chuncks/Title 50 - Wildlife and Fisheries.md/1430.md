####### How will the effectiveness of this reintroduction be monitored?

(4)The status of the reintroduction project will receive an informal review on an annual basis, and we will evaluate the reintroduction program to determine whether to continue or terminate reintroductions every 5 years as part of our 5-year status review for the species.

(i) This evaluation will include, but will not be limited to: A review of management issues; California condor movements and post-release behavior; assessment of food resources and dependence of California condors on supplemental food; fecundity of the population; causes and rates of mortality; project costs; public acceptance; and progress toward establishing a self-sustaining population.

(ii) If a formal evaluation indicates the project is experiencing a 40 percent or greater mortality rate over multiple years or released California condors are not finding food on their own, serious consideration will be given to terminating the project.
