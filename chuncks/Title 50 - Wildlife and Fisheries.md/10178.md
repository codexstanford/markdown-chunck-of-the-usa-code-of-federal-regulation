####### General conditions.,i.e.,

(a)(1) Researchers must observe a site from a distance for at least five minutes, using binoculars if necessary, to detect any marine mammals prior to approach to determine if mitigation is required (site surveys will not be conducted if other species of pinnipeds are present, researchers will approach with caution, walking slowly, quietly, and close to the ground to avoid surprising any hauled-out individuals and to reduce flushing/stampeding of individuals).
