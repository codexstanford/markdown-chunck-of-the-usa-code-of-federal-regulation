####### Big game hunting.

(3)We allow hunting of white-tailed deer and feral hog on designated areas of the refuge subject to the following conditions:

(i) We require a refuge permit (signed refuge hunt brochure) and Harvest Report (FWS Form 3-2542). Hunters must turn in both forms by the date specified on the permit. Failure to submit the Harvest Report will render the hunter ineligible for the next year's limited big game hunt. Drawings are by lottery. The hunter must carry the nontransferable permit at all times while hunting.

(ii) The conditions set forth at paragraphs (p)(1)(v) and (p)(2)(iv) through (vii) of this section apply.

(iii) We allow hunting during a designated 23-day archery season.
