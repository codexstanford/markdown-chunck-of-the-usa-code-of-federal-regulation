(3)Annually, IBQ shares and resultant allocations will be designated as either "GOM" (Gulf of Mexico) or "ATL" (Atlantic), based upon the location (in the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic region) of sets included in the calculation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Subject to the GOM share cap described below, each region's total shares and resultant allocations for the year will be based on the percentage of sets designated for the region compared to total sets. Per ยง 635.28(a)(1), NMFS will file a closure action when a region's IBQ allocations have been reached or are projected to be reached. For the purposes of this section, the Gulf of Mexico region includes all waters of the U.S. EEZ west and north of the boundary stipulated at ยง 600.105(c) of this chapter, and the Atlantic region includes all other waters of the Atlantic Ocean including fishing taking place in the NED defined at ยง 635.2. If an IBQ shareholder's vessel had fishing history in both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic region, it could receive both GOM and ATL shares.
