####### Sport fishing.

(4)We allow sport fishing, crabbing, and clamming from the shoreline of the refuge in designated areas subject to the following conditions:

(i) You must attend minnow traps, crab traps, crab pots, and handlines at all times.

(ii) We prohibit the use of seine nets and pneumatic (compressed air or otherwise) bait launchers.

(iii) The State regulates certain species of finfish, shellfish, and crustacean (crab) using size or possession limits. You may not alter these species, to include cleaning or filleting, in such a way that we cannot determine its species or total length.

(iv) In order to fish after the refuge closes for the day, anglers must obtain an overnight fishing pass (name/address/phone) issued by the National Park Service. Anglers can obtain a pass in person at the National Park Service Tom's Cove Visitor Center.

(v) We allow the possession or use of only three surf fishing poles per licensed angler, and those poles must be attended at all times. This includes persons age 65 or older who are license-exempt in Virginia.
