##### ยง 660.333 Open access non-groundfish trawl fishery - management measures.
###### Groundfish taken with non-groundfish trawl gear by vessels engaged in fishing for pink shrimp.

(e)Notwithstanding ยง 660.60(h)(7), a vessel that takes and retains pink shrimp and also takes and retains groundfish in either the limited entry or another open access fishery during the same applicable cumulative limit period that it takes and retains pink shrimp (which may be 1 month or 2 months, depending on the fishery and the time of year), may retain the larger of the two limits, but only if the limit(s) for each gear or fishery are not exceeded when operating in that fishery or with that gear. The limits are not additive; the vessel may not retain a separate trip limit for each fishery.
