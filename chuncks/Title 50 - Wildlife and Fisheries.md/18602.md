###### AM when only one sector's landings are available.

(7)When landings for one sector are not available for comparison to that sector's ACL, the ACL for the sector with available landings in paragraph (a) of this section is the applicable ACL for the stock or stock complex. If NMFS estimates that available landings for the stock, stock complex, or indicator stock, have exceeded the applicable ACL for the stock or stock complex, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the length of the fishing season for the stock or stock complex within that fishing year by the amount necessary to prevent landings from exceeding the ACL, unless NMFS determines that a fishing season reduction is not necessary based on the best scientific information available. If NMFS determines that the ACL was exceeded because data collection or monitoring improved rather than because landings increased, NMFS will not reduce the length of the fishing season for the stock or stock complex.
