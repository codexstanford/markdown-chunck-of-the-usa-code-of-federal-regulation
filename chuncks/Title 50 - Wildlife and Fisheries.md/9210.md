#### PART 92 - MIGRATORY BIRD SUBSISTENCE HARVEST IN ALASKA
##### Subpart D - Annual Regulations Governing Subsistence Harvest
###### ยง 92.32 Emergency regulations to protect Steller's eiders.
####### (Polysticta stelleri),

Upon finding that continuation of these subsistence regulations would pose an imminent threat to the conservation of threatened Steller's eidersthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Alaska Regional Director, in consultation with the Co-management Council, will immediately under ยง 92.21 take action as is necessary to prevent further take. Regulation changes implemented could range from a temporary closure of duck hunting in a small geographic area to large-scale regional or statewide long-term closures of all subsistence migratory bird hunting. These closures or temporary suspensions will remain in effect until the Regional Director, in consultation with the Co-management Council, determines that the potential for additional Steller's eiders to be taken no longer exists.
