###### Gulf migratory group king mackerel,Commercial sector.

(a)-(1)(i) If commercial landings, as estimated by the SRD, reach or are projected to reach the applicable quota specified in ยง 622.384(b)(1), the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the commercial sector for that zone, or gear type for the remainder of the fishing year.

(ii) The commercial ACL for the Gulf migratory group of king mackerel is 2,998,400 lb (1,360,051 kg) for the 2021-2022 fishing year, 3,110,400 lb (1,410,854 kg) for the 2022-2023 fishing year, and 3,196,800 lb (1,450,044 kg) for the 2023-2024 and subsequent fishing years. The ACL is further divided into a commercial ACL for vessels fishing with hook-and-line and a commercial ACL for vessels fishing with run-around gillnets. The hook-and-line ACL (which applies to the entire Gulf) is 2,368,736 lb (1,074,441 kg) for the 2021-2022 fishing year, 2,457,216 lb (1,114,574 kg) for the 2022-2023 fishing year, and 2,525,472 lb (1,145,535 kg) for the 2023-2024 and subsequent fishing years.

(iii) If commercial landings of Gulf migratory group king mackerel caught by run-around gillnet in the southern zone, as estimated by the SRD, exceed the commercial ACL, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the commercial ACL for king mackerel harvested by run-around gillnet in the southern zone in the following fishing year by the amount of the commercial ACL overage in the prior fishing year.
