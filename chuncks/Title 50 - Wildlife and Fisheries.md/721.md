(i) The wildlife is of a species having a natural geographic distribution not including any part of the United States, or the wildlife is of a species that the Director has determined to be eligible in accordance with paragraph (g)(5) of this section;

(ii) The purpose of such activity is to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species;

(iii) Such activity does not involve interstate or foreign commerce, in the course of a commercial activity, with respect to non-living wildlife;

(iv) Each specimen of wildlife to be re-imported is uniquely identified by a band, tattoo or other means that was reported in writing to an official of the Service at a port of export prior to export from the United States; and

Requests for registration must be submitted on an official application form (Form 3-200-41) provided by the Service, and must include the following information:

(i) The types of wildlife sought to be covered by the registration, identified by common and scientific name to the taxonomic level of family, genus or species;

(ii) A description of the applicant's experience in maintaining and propagating the types of wildlife sought to be covered by the registration, and when appropriate, in conducting research directly related to maintaining and propagating such wildlife;

(iii) Photograph(s) or other evidence clearly depicting the facilities where such wildlife will be maintained; and

(iv) a copy of the applicant's license or registration, if any, under the animal welfare regulations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (9 CFR part 2).

(i) At the completion of this comment period, the Director will decide whether to approve the registration. In making this decision, the Director will consider, in addition to the general criteria in § 13.21(b) of this subchapter, whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available to the applicant appear adequate to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected wildlife.

(5)(i) The Director will use the following criteria to determine if wildlife of any species having a natural geographic distribution that includes any part of the United States is eligible for the provisions of this paragraph:

(A) Whether there is a low demand for taking of the species from wild populations, either because of the success of captive breeding or because of other reasons, and

(B) Whether the wild populations of the species are effectively protected from unauthorized taking as a result of the inaccessibility of their habitat to humans or as a result of the effectiveness of law enforcement.

(ii) The Director will follow the procedures set forth in the Act and in the regulations thereunder with respect to petitions and notification of the public and governors of affected States when determining the eligibility of species for purposes of this paragraph.
