##### Derivative classification.

(c)Derivative classification markings shall be applied to information that is in substance the same as information that is already classified, in accordance with Executive Order 12356, Section 2-1, unless it is determined through inquiries made to the originators of the classified information or other appropriate persons that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of the classified information obviates the need for its classification, in which case the information shall be issued as unclassified or shall be marked appropriately. After verifying the current level of classification so far as practicable, paper copies of such derivatively classified information shall be marked so as to indicate:

(1) The source of the original classification;

(2) The identity of the Commission employee originating the derivatively classified document;

(3) The dates or events for declassification or review for declassification indicated on the classified source material; and

(4) Any additional authorized markings appearing on the source material.
