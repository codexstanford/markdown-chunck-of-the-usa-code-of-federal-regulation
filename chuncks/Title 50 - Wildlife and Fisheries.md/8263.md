####### Most directly affected Native Corporation determination.

(f)(1) Prior to the issuance of a solicitation document for any new visitor service in a refuge, the Refuge Manager shall provide an opportunity for any Native Corporation interested in providing visitor services within that refuge to submit an application to the Refuge Manager to be determined "most directly affected" Native Corporation. The application shall include but not be limited to, the following information:

(i) The name, address, and telephone number of the Native Corporation, the date of incorporation, its articles of incorporation and structure, and the name of the applicable refuge area;

(ii) The location of the corporation's population center or centers;

(iii) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts, including historical and traditional use, and their effects on the Native Corporation as a result of the expansion or establishment of the refuge; and

(iv) Any other information the Native Corporation believes is relevant.

(2) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native Corporations, the Refuge Manager will determine the "most directly affected" Native Corporation based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:

(i) The number of acres of surface land within and adjoining the refuge that the Native Corporation owns, or which has been selected under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, unless such selection is determined to be invalid or is relinquished;

(ii) The distance and accessibility from the Native Corporation's population center and/or business address to the applicable refuge; and

(iii) The socio-economic impacts, including historic and traditional use, and their effects as a result of the expansion or establishment of the refuge.

(3) In the event that more than one Native Corporation is determined to be equally affected, each such Native Corporation shall be considered as a preferred operator under this section.

(4) The Refuge Manager's "most directly affected" Native Corporation determination or when requested, the Regional Director's appeal decision for a refuge is applicable for all new visitor services in that refuge.

(5) Any Native Corporation that has not applied for a most directly affected Native Corporation determination may apply for a determination upon issuance of a future solicitation for a new visitor service. A corporation determined to be most directly affected for a refuge will maintain that status for all future visitor service solicitations.
