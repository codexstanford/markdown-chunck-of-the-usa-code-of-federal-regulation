###### Vessel identification.

(a)(1) The operator of each FFV assigned an IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is visible from an enforcement vessel, and on an appropriate weather deck so it is visible from the air.

(2) The operator of each FFV not assigned an IRCS, such as a small trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of trawlers, must display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a numerical suffix. (For example, JCZM-1, JCZM-2, etc., would be displayed on small trawlers not assigned an IRCS operating with a mothership whose IRCS is JCZM; JANP-1 would be displayed by a pair trawler not assigned an IRCS operating with a trawler whose IRCS is JANP.)

(3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the background and must be permanently affixed to the FFV in block Roman alphabet letters and Arabic numerals at least 1 m in height for FFV's over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height for all other FFV's.
