#### Subpart L - Fishing Capacity Reduction Framework
##### ยง 600.1011 Reduction methods and other conditions.
###### Effect of reduction-contract nonperformance.

(g)No referendum, no reduction contract, no reduction loan, and no fee payment and collection obligation under ยง 600.1013 and ยง 600.1014 necessary to repay any reduction loan, shall be impaired, invalidated, avoided, or otherwise rendered unenforceable by virtue of any reduction contract's nonperformance. This is without regard to the cause of, or reason for, nonperformance. NMFS shall endeavor to enforce the specific performance of all reduction contracts, but NMFS' inability, for any reason, to enforce specific performance for any portion of such reduction contracts shall not relieve fish sellers of their obligation to pay, and fish buyers of their obligation to collect, the fee necessary to fully repay the full reduction loan balance that results from all reduction payments that NMFS actually makes and does not recover.
