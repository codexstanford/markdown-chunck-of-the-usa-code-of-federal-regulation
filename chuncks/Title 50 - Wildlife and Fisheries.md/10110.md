###### § 217.64 Mitigation requirements.

When conducting the activities identified in § 217.60(a), the mitigation measures contained in any Letter of Authorization issued under §§ 216.106 of this chapter and 217.66 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include (but are not limited to):

(a) For missile and rocket launches, the USAF must avoid, whenever possible, launches during the harbor seal pupping season of March through June, unless constrained by factors including, but not limited to, human safety, national security, or launch mission objectives.

(b) For rocket launches, the USAF must avoid, whenever possible, launches which are predicted to produce a sonic boom on the Northern Channel Islands from March through June.

(c) Aircraft and helicopter flight paths must maintain a minimum distance of 1,000 feet (ft) (305 meters (m)) from recognized pinniped haulouts and rookeries, whenever possible, except for one area near the VAFB harbor over which aircraft may be flown to within 500 ft of a haulout, and except in emergencies or for real-time security incidents, which may require approaching pinniped haulouts and rookeries closer than 1,000 ft (305 m).

(d) Except for during take-off and landing actions, the following minimum altitudes must be maintained over all known marine mammal haulouts when marine mammals are present: For Class 0-2 UAS, a minimum of 300 ft; for Class 3 UAS, a minimum of 500 ft; and for Class 4 or 5 UAS, a minimum of 1,000 ft.

(e) If post-launch surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the launch procedure and the monitoring methods must be reviewed, in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and appropriate changes must be made through modification to a Letter of Authorization, prior to conducting the next launch under that Letter of Authorization.
