###### IBQ share calculations.

(1)Annually, NMFS will calculate IBQ shares for each IBQ shareholder based upon the total number of each eligible vessel's pelagic longline sets during the relevant 36 month period, and the relative amount (as a percentage) those pelagic longline sets represent compared to the total number of pelagic longline sets made by all IBQ shareholders' eligible vessels. NMFS will only count one set per calendar day toward a vessel's total number of pelagic longline sets, and will only count a set if a vessel was issued a valid Atlantic Tunas Longline category LAP when the set occurred. The annual IBQ share percentage is used to calculate the annual IBQ allocation (see paragraph (d) of this section).
