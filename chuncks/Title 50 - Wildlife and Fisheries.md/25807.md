##### ยง 679.2 Definitions.
###### IFQ crew member

means any individual who has at least 150 days experience working as part of the harvesting crew in any U.S. commercial fishery, or any individual who receives an initial allocation of QS. For purposes of this definition, "harvesting" means work that is directly related to the catching and retaining of fish. Work in support of harvesting, but not directly involved with harvesting, is not considered harvesting crew work. For example, searching for fish, work on a fishing vessel only as an engineer or cook, or work preparing a vessel for a fishing trip would not be considered work of a harvesting crew.
