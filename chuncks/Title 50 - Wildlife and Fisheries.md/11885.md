####### Critical habitat boundaries.

(a)Critical habitat is designated to include all areas in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section and as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Northwestern Hawaiian Islands: Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat areas include all beach areas, sand spits and islets, including all beach crest vegetation to its deepest extent inland, lagoon waters, inner reef waters, and including marine habitat through the water's edge, including the seafloor and all subsurface waters and marine habitat within 10 m of the seafloor, out to the 200-m depth contour line (relative to mean lower low water) around the following 10 areas:

(i) Kure Atoll,

(ii) Midway Islands,

(iii) Pearl and Hermes Reef,

(iv) Lisianski Island,

(v) Laysan Island,

(vi) Maro Reef,

(vii) Gardner Pinnacles,

(viii) French Frigate Shoals,

(ix) Necker Island, and

(x) Nihoa Island.

(2) Main Hawaiian Islands: Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat areas surrounding the following islands listed below are defined in the marine environment by a seaward boundary that extends from the 200-m depth contour line (relative to mean lower low water), including the seafloor and all subsurface waters and marine habitat within 10 m of the seafloor, through the water's edge into the terrestrial environment where the inland boundary extends 5 m (in length) from the shoreline between identified boundary points listed in the table below around the areas listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)-(vi) of this section. The shoreline is described by the upper reaches of the wash of the waves, other than storm or seismic waves, at high tide during the season in which the highest wash of the waves occurs, usually evidenced by the edge of vegetation growth or the upper limit of debris (except those areas identified in paragraph (c) of this section). In areas where critical habitat does not extend inland, the designation has a seaward boundary of a line that marks mean lower low water.

(i) Kaula Island,

(ii) Niihau,

(iii) Kauai,

(iv) Oahu,

(v) Maui Nui (including Kahoolawe, Lanai, Maui, and Molokai), and

(vi) Hawaii.
