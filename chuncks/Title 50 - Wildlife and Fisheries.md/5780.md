###### ยง 23.61 What factors are considered in making a non-detriment finding?
####### How we make our findings.

(f)We base the non-detriment finding on the best available biological information. We also consider trade information, including trade demand, and other scientific management information. We make a non-detriment finding in the following way:

(1) We consult with the States, Tribes, other Federal agencies, scientists, other experts, and the range countries of the species.

(2) We consult with the Secretariat and other Parties to monitor the level of trade that is occurring in the species.

(3) Based on the factors in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, we evaluate the biological impact of the proposed activity.

(4) In cases where insufficient information is available or the factors above are not satisfactorily addressed, we take precautionary measures and would be unable to make the required finding of non-detriment.
