###### Process for issuing BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsements.

(v)(A) NMFS will issue to the holder of each groundfish LLP license with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area and catcher/processor operation endorsements, and specified in Column A of Table 57 of this part, a notice of eligibility to receive a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement and a revised groundfish LLP license with a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement.

(B) NMFS will issue to the holder of a groundfish LLP license with Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands area and catcher/processor operation endorsements, and that is not listed in Table 57 of this part, a notice informing that holder that the groundfish LLP license is not eligible to be credited with at least one legal mothership trip target of Pacific cod in the BSAI non-CDQ Pacific cod trawl catcher vessel fishery for each year during the qualifying period or receive a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement based on the official record, using the address on record at the time the notice is sent. The notice specified in this paragraph (k)(15)(v)(B) will inform the holder of the groundfish LLP license of the timing and process through which the holder can provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record of this section, as specified in paragraphs (k)(15)(v)(C) and (D) of this section.

(C) The Regional Administrator will specify by notice a 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record. A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination (IAD).

(D) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period, if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support the person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information or evidence submitted. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to 15 CFR part 906. NMFS will issue a non-transferable interim license that is effective until final agency action on the IAD to an applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD and who has a credible claim to eligibility for a BSAI Pacific cod trawl mothership endorsement.
