#### Subpart F - Management Measures for the NE Multispecies and Monkfish Fisheries
##### ยง 648.93 Monkfish minimum fish sizes.
###### General provisions.

(a)All monkfish caught by vessels issued a valid Federal monkfish permit must meet the minimum fish size requirements established in this section.

(b) The minimum fish size applies to the whole fish (total length) or to the tail of a fish (tail length) at the time of landing. Fish or parts of fish, with the exception of cheeks and livers, must have skin on while possessed on board a vessel and at the time of landing in order to meet minimum size requirements. "Skin on" means the entire portion of the skin normally attached to the portion of the fish or fish parts possessed. Monkfish tails are measured from the anterior portion of the fourth cephalic dorsal spine to the end of the caudal fin. Any tissue anterior to the fourth dorsal spine is ignored. If the fourth dorsal spine or the tail is not intact, the minimum size is measured between the most anterior vertebra and the most posterior portion of the tail.
