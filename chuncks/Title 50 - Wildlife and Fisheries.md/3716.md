####### Maps and critical habitat unit descriptions for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

(g)The following paragraphs contain the legal descriptions of the critical habitat units designated for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Existing manmade features within boundaries of the mapped areas, such as water features, telecommunications equipment, arboreta and gardens, and heiau (indigenous places of worship or shrines) and other archaeological sites do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements described for each species in paragraphs (h) of this section and therefore are not included in the critical habitat designations. Coordinates are in WGS84 datum. See Map 1 for the general locations of the seven critical habitat units designated for the islands of Laysan, Nihoa, and Necker.
