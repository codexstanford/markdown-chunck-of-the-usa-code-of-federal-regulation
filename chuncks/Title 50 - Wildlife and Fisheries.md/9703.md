####### Exceptions.

(c)The prohibitions of paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to:

(1) Any person who inadvertently comes within 50 yards (45.7 m) of a Hawaiian spinner dolphin or is approached by a spinner dolphin, provided the person makes no effort to engage or pursue the animal and takes immediate steps to move away from the animal;

(2) Any vessel that is underway and is approached by a Hawaiian spinner dolphin, provided the vessel continues normal navigation and makes no effort to engage or pursue the animal. For purposes of this exception, a vessel is defined as a watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water (1 U.S.C. 3); a vessel is underway if it is not made fast to the shore, at anchor, or aground;

(3) Any vessel transiting to or from a port, harbor, or in a restricted channel when a 50-yard (45.7 m) distance will not allow the vessel to maintain safe navigation;

(4) Vessel operations necessary to avoid an imminent and serious threat to a person or vessel;

(5) Any vessel that is anchored or aground and is approached by a Hawaiian spinner dolphin, provided the vessel makes no effort to engage or pursue the animal;

(6) Activities authorized through a permit or authorization issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service to take Hawaiian spinner dolphins;

(7) Federal, State, or local government vessels, aircraft, personnel, and assets when necessary in the course of performing official duties;

(8) Commercial fishing vessels that incidentally take spinner dolphins during the course of commercial fishing operations, provided such vessels operate in compliance with a valid marine mammal authorization in accordance with MMPA section 118(c).
