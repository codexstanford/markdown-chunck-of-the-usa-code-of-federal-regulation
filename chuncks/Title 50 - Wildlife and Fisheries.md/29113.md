##### Test Considerations

A.2

A.2.1 All electronic scales of the same category must be subjected to the same performance test program.

A.2.2 Tests must be carried out on fully operational equipment in its normal operational state. When equipment is connected in other than a normal configuration, the procedure must be mutually agreed to by NMFS and the applicant.

A.2.3 When the effect of one factor is being evaluated, all other factors must be held relatively constant, at a value close to normal. The temperature is deemed to be relatively constant when the difference between the extreme temperatures noted during the test does not exceed 5 &#xB0;C and the variation over time does not exceed 5 &#xB0;C per hour.

A.2.4 Before the start of a test, the equipment under test (EUT) must be energized for a period of time at least equal to the warm-up time specified by the manufacturer. The EUT must remain energized throughout the duration of the test.
