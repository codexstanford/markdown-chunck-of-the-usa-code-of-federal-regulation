#### Subpart R - Standardized Bycatch Reporting Methodology
##### ยง 600.1610 Establishing and reviewing standardized bycatch reporting methodologies in fishery management plans.
###### Feasibility.

(ii)The implementation of a standardized reporting methodology must be feasible from cost, technical, and operational perspectives. However, feasibility concerns do not exempt an FMP from the requirement to establish a standardized reporting methodology. Recognizing that costs and funding may vary from year to year, a Council must also address how implementation of the standardized reporting methodology may be adjusted while continuing to meet the purpose described under ยง 600.1600.
