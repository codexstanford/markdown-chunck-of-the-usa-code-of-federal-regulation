(a) If pelagic longline gear is on board a vessel, a person aboard such vessel may not fish for or retain a dolphin or wahoo-

(1) In the Northeastern United States closed area from June 1 through June 30 each year. The Northeastern United States closed area is that portion of the EEZ between 40&#xB0; N. lat. and 39&#xB0; N. lat. from 68&#xB0; W. long. to 74&#xB0; W. long.

(2) In the Charleston Bump closed area from February 1 through April 30 each year. The Charleston Bump closed area is that portion of the EEZ off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia between 34&#xB0; N. lat. and 31&#xB0; N. lat. and west of 76&#xB0; W. long.

(3) In the East Florida Coast closed area year round. The East Florida Coast closed area is that portion of the EEZ off Georgia and the east coast of Florida from the inner boundary of the EEZ at 31&#xB0; N. lat.; thence due east to 78&#xB0; W. long.; thence by a rhumb line to 28&#xB0;17&#x2032; N. lat., 79&#xB0;12&#x2032; W. long.; thence proceeding in a southerly direction along the outer boundary of the EEZ to 24&#xB0; N. lat.; thence due west to 24&#xB0; N. lat., 81&#xB0;47&#x2032; W. long.; thence due north to the innermost boundary of the EEZ at 81&#xB0;47&#x2032; W. long.

(b) A vessel is considered to have pelagic longline gear on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a mainline, floats capable of supporting the mainline, and gangions with hooks are on board. Removal of any one of these elements constitutes removal of pelagic longline gear.

(c) If a vessel is in a closed area during a time specified in paragraph (a) of this section with pelagic longline gear on board, it is a rebuttable presumption that fish on board such vessel were taken with pelagic longline gear in the closed area.
