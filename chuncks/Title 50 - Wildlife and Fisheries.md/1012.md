(i) The conversion of sun-grown coffee to shade-grown coffee plantations by the restoration and maintenance (removal of invasive, exotic, and feral species; shade and coffee tree seasonal pruning; shade and coffee tree planting and replacement; coffee bean harvest by hands-on methods; and the use of standard pest control methods and fertilizers within the plantations) of shade-grown coffee plantations and native forests associated with this type of crop. To minimize disturbance to the elfin-woods warbler, shade and coffee tree seasonal pruning must be conducted between September 1 and February 28, which is the time period outside the peak of the elfin-woods warbler's breeding season. The Service considers the use of pest control methods (e.g., pesticides, herbicides) and fertilizers "standard" when it is used only twice a year during the establishment period of shade and coffee trees (the first 2 years). Once the shade-grown coffee system reaches its functionality and structure (3 to 4 years), little or no chemical fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides may be used.

(ii) Riparian buffer establishment though the planting of native vegetation and selective removal of exotic species.
