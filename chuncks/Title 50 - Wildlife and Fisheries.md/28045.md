## Chapter VI - Fishery Conservation and Management, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce
### PART 679 - FISHERIES OF THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE OFF ALASKA
#### Subpart D - Individual Fishing Quota Management Measures
##### ยง 679.40 Sablefish and halibut QS.
###### Excess RFQ.

(iii)NMFS will not issue the RQE any excess RFQ. Excess RFQ is the difference between the amount of RFQ based on the QS held by the RQE and the amount of RFQ needed to provide charter fishery management measures that are equivalent to unguided recreational fishery management measures. If the annual management measures published pursuant to ยง 300.62 of this title specify charter fishery management measures that are equivalent to the unguided recreational management measures, NMFS will:

(A) Calculate the annual allocation of halibut RFQ to the RQE as specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section; and

(B) Determine the amount of RFQ needed to supplement the annual guided sport catch limit from the CSP in Area 2C and Area 3A (described in ยง 300.65(c) of this title) to account for charter fishery harvests under the charter fishery management measures specified in the annual management measures and issue that amount of RFQ to the RFQ permit account.

(C) Calculate the amount of excess RFQ by subtracting the amount of RFQ issued as determined in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section from the annual calculation of RFQ halibut to the RQE as calculated in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section.
