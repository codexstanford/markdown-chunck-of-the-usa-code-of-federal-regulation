() For each shoreside processor which has received deliveries of at least 1 mt of whiting from whiting trips in each of any two years from 1998 through 2004, NMFS will calculate a whiting relative history for each qualifying year, as follows. First, NMFS will sum the shoreside processor's receipts of whiting for each year. Second, NMFS will calculate the relative history for each year by dividing each shoreside processor's annual sum of whiting receipts by the aggregate annual sum of whiting received by all shoreside processors in that year. NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for each shoreside processor by adding all relative histories for the shoreside processor together and subtracting the two years with the lowest relative history. NMFS will then divide the result for each shoreside processor by the aggregate sum of all total relative histories for whiting by all qualifying shoreside processors. The result from this calculation will then be multiplied by 20 percent to determine the shoreside processor's whiting QS.
