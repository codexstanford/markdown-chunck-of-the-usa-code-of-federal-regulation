##### Significant fault-

An error greater than the value specified for a particular scale. For a belt scale: A fault greater than 0.18 percent of the weight value equal to the minimum totalized load. For all other scales: 1 scale division (d). A significant fault does not include faults that result from simultaneous and mutually independent causes in the belt scale; faults that imply the impossibility of performing any measurement; transitory faults that are momentary variations in the indications that cannot be interpreted, memorized, or transmitted as a measurement result; faults so serious that they will inevitably be noticed by those interested in the measurement.
