###### Respond to industry requests for observers.

(v)An observer provider must provide an observer for deployment pursuant to the terms of the contractual relationship with the vessel to fulfill vessel requirements for observer coverage under paragraphs (h)(5)(xi)(D) of this section. An alternate observer must be supplied in each case where injury or illness prevents an observer from performing his or her duties or where an observer resigns prior to completion of his or her duties. If the observer provider is unable to respond to an industry request for observer coverage from a vessel for whom the observer provider is in a contractual relationship due to the lack of available observers by the estimated embarking time of the vessel, the observer provider must report it to NMFS at least four hours prior to the vessel's estimated embarking time, unless the vessel provides less than four hour notice to the provider, in which case the provider is to notify NMFS as soon as practical after the situation arises.
