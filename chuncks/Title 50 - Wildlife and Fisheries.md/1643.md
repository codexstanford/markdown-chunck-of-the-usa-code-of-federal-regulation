(i)

(1) Critical habitat units are designated for Cerro Gordo, Dickinson, Emmet, Howard, Kossuth, and Osceola Counties in Iowa; in Hilsdale, Jackson, Lenawee, Livingston, Oakland, and Washtenaw Counties in Michigan; Chippewa, Clay, Cottonwood, Douglas, Kittson, Lac Qui Parle, Lincoln, Lyon, Mahnomen, Murray, Norman, Pipestone, Polk, Pope, Swift, and Wilkin Counties in Minnesota; Richland County in North Dakota; Brookings, Day, Deuel, Grant, Marshall, Moody, and Roberts Counties in South Dakota; and Green Lake and Waukesha Counties in Wisconsin, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Poweshiek skipperling consist of four components:

(i) Primary Constituent Element 1-Wet-mesic to dry tallgrass remnant untilled prairies or remnant moist meadows containing:

(A) A predominance of native grasses and native flowering forbs;

(B) Undisturbed (untilled) glacial soil types including, but not limited to, loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, gravel, organic soils (peat), or marl that provide the edaphic features conducive to Poweshiek skipperling larval survival and native-prairie vegetation;

(C) If present, depressional wetlands or low wet areas, within or adjacent to prairies that provide shelter from high summer temperatures and fire;

(D) If present, trees or large shrub cover less than 5 percent of area in dry prairies and less than 25 percent in wet-mesic prairies and prairie fens; and

(E) If present, nonnative invasive plant species occurring in less than 5 percent of area.

(ii) Primary Constituent Element 2-Prairie fen habitats containing:

(A) A predominance of native grasses and native flowering forbs;

(B) Undisturbed (untilled) glacial soil types including, but not limited to, organic soils (peat), or marl that provide the edaphic features conducive to Poweshiek skipperling larval survival and native-prairie vegetation;

(C) Depressional wetlands or low wet areas, within or adjacent to prairies that provide shelter from high summer temperatures and fire;

(D) Hydraulic features necessary to maintain prairie fen groundwater flow and prairie fen plant communities;

(E) If present, trees or large shrub cover less than 25 percent of the unit; and

(F) If present, nonnative invasive plant species occurring in less than 5 percent of area.

(iii) Primary Constituent Element 3-Native grasses and native flowering forbs for larval and adult food and shelter, specifically:
