###### Product storage.

(f)The operator of each permitted FFV storing fish or fish products in a storage space must ensure that all non-fish product items are neither stowed beneath nor covered by fish products, unless required to maintain the stability and safety of the vessel. These items include, but are not limited to, portable conveyors, exhaust fans, ladders, nets, fuel bladders, extra bin boards, or other movable non-product items. These items may be in the space when necessary for safety of the vessel or crew or for storage of the product. Lumber, bin boards, or other dunnage may be used for shoring or bracing of product to ensure safety of crew and to prevent shifting of cargo within the space.
