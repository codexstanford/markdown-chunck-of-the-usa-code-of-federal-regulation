(2)-(i)An MS/CV-endorsed permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at ยง 660.25(b)(4). During renewal, all MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit owners must make a preliminary declaration regarding their intent to participate in the co-op or non-co-op portion of the MS Co-op Program for the following year. MS/CV-endorsed permits not obligated to a permitted MS co-op by March 17 of the fishing year will be assigned to the non-co-op fishery. For an MS/CV-endorsed permit that is not renewed, the following occurs:

(A) For the first year after the permit is not renewed, the permit will be extinguished, and the catch history assignment from that permit will be assigned to the non-coop fishery.

(B) In the year after the permit is extinguished (the second year after the permit is not renewed), the catch history assignment from that permit will be redistributed proportionally to all valid MS/CV-endorsed permits.
