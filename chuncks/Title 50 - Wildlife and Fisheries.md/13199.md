####### Constricted migratory habitat.

(4)We describe the PBF of constricted migratory habitat as high use migratory corridors that are constricted (limited in width) by land on one side and the edge of the continental shelf and Gulf Stream on the other side. PCEs that support this habitat are the following:

(i) Constricted continental shelf area relative to nearby continental shelf waters that concentrate migratory pathways; and

(ii) Passage conditions to allow for migration to and from nesting, breeding, and/or foraging areas.
