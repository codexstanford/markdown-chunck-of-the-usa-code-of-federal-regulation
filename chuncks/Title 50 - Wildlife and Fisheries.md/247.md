####### Designated ports.

(a)All wildlife arriving at a designated port must be cleared by a Service officer prior to Customs clearance and release. When importers or their agents expect live or perishable shipments of wildlife or wildlife products or request inspection at the time of arrival, they must notify the Service at least 48 hours prior to the estimated time of arrival. However, where a Service officer is not available within a reasonable time, Customs Officers may clear live or perishable wildlife subject to post-clearance inspection and investigation by the Service.
