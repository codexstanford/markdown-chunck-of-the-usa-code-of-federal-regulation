###### Return receipt.

(8)(i) Upon receiving an ELB data export, NMFS will generate a dated return-receipt to confirm receipt of the ELB data. If errors exist in the data transmitted to NMFS, the receipt will identify the errors. If errors are identified, the operator must correct the errors and send a revised transmission to NMFS which will then confirm acceptance of the ELB data.

(ii) The operator must retain the NMFS return receipt as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(iii) If a return receipt from NMFS is not received within 24 hours, the operator of the catcher vessel, the operator of a catcher/processor, the operator of the mothership, or the manager of the shoreside processor or SFP forwarding the ELB data export for the operator of the catcher vessel, must contact NMFS by telephone at 907-586-7228 or fax at 907-586-7131 for instructions.
