###### Renewal, change of permit ownership, or vessel registration,Renewal.

(2)-(i)An MS permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at ยง 660.25(b)(4). If a vessel registered to the MS permit will operate as a mothership in the year for which the permit is renewed, the permit owner must make a declaration as part of the permit renewal that while participating in the whiting fishery it will operate solely as a mothership during the calendar year to which its limited entry permit applies. Any such declaration is binding on the vessel for the calendar year, even if the permit is registered to a different permit owner during the year, unless it is rescinded in response to a written request from the permit owner. Any request to rescind a declaration must be made by the permit owner and granted in writing by the Regional Administrator before any unprocessed whiting has been taken on board the vessel that calendar year.
