####### LOGG-S-1-Atlantic Ocean Sargassum:,Sargassum

(37)This unit containshabitat and overlaps with breeding habitat (LOGG-N-17). The western edge of the unit is the Gulf of Mexico-Atlantic border (83&#xB0; W. long.) from 24.58&#xB0; N. lat. to 23.82&#xB0; N. lat. The outer boundary of the unit is the U.S. EEZ, starting at the Gulf of Mexico-Atlantic border (23.82&#xB0; N. lat., 83&#xB0; W. long.) and proceeding east and north until the EEZ coincides with the Gulf Stream at 37.84&#xB0; N. lat., 70.59&#xB0; W. long. The inner boundary of the unit starts at the Gulf of Mexico-Atlantic border (24.58&#xB0; N. lat., 83&#xB0; W. long.) to the outer edge of the breeding/migratory critical habitat (LOGG-N-19) at 24.34&#xB0; N. lat., 82.16&#xB0; W. long., along the outer edge of the corridor (following the 200 m depth contour) until it coincides with the breeding habitat off of Cape Canaveral (LOGG-N-17) at 27.97&#xB0; N. lat., 80.14&#xB0; W. long., and from there roughly following the velocity of 0.401-0.50 m/second (Ocean Conservancy 2012; PMEL 2012) until it coincides with the outer edge of the EEZ at 37.84&#xB0; N. lat., 70.59&#xB0; W. long.
