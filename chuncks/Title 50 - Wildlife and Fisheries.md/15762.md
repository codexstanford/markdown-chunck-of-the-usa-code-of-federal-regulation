##### ยง 451.02 Applications for exemptions.
###### When to apply.

(d)(1) Except in the case of agency action involving a permit or license application, an application for an exemption must be submitted to the Secretary within 90 days following the termination of the consultation process.

(2) In the case of agency action involving a permit or license application, an application for an exemption may be submitted after the Federal agency concerned formally denies the permit or license. An applicant denied a permit or license may not simultaneously seek administrative review within the permitting or licensing agency and apply for an exemption. If administrative review is sought, an application for an exemption may be submitted if that review results in a formal denial of the permit or license. For an exemption application to be considered, it must be submitted within 90 days after the date of a formal denial of a permit or license.
