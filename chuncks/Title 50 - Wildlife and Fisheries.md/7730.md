####### Big game hunting.

(3)We allow hunting of white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and feral hog on designated areas of the refuge subject to the following conditions:

(i) You must possess and carry a signed refuge hunt brochure for the archery deer hunt. Hunters must turn in a Harvest Report (FWS Form 3-2542) by December 31 annually. Failure to submit the report will render the hunter ineligible for the next year's limited season archery deer hunt.

(ii) We will offer a limited season archery deer hunt following the controlled deer hunt.

(iii) You may hunt feral hog during any established refuge hunting season.

(iv) Hunters may place no more than one stand on the refuge. You may place stands starting on the day the hunt begins. You must remove stands the day the hunt ends (see ยง 27.93 of this chapter).
