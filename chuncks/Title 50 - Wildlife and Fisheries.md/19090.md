###### Inseason quota transfers.

(2)NMFS may transfer additional quota to the Longline category inseason as authorized under ยง 635.27(a), and in accordance with ยง 635.27(a)(7) and (8). NMFS may distribute the quota that is transferred inseason to the Longline category either to all IBQ shareholders or to all permitted Atlantic Tunas Longline category LAP vessels that are determined by NMFS to have any recent fishing activity in the pelagic longline fishery. In making this decision, NMFS will consider factors for the subject and previous year such as the number of BFT landings and dead discards, the number of IBQ lease transactions, the average amount of IBQ leased, the average amount of quota debt, the annual amount of IBQ allocation, any previous inseason allocations of IBQ allocation, the amount of BFT quota in the Reserve category (at ยง 635.27(a)(6)(i)), the percentage of BFT quota harvested by the other quota categories, the remaining number of days in the year, the number of active vessels fishing not associated with IBQ share, and the number of vessels that have incurred quota debt or that have low levels of IBQ allocation. NMFS will determine if a vessel has any recent fishing activity based upon the best available information for the subject and previous year, such as logbook, vessel monitoring system, or electronic monitoring data. Any distribution of quota transferred inseason will be equal among eligible IBQ shareholders or active vessels, and include regional designations of IBQ allocations (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
