(b)We will follow these general principles in making a decision on whether an applicant has facilities that would provide proper housing to maintain the specimens for the intended purpose and the expertise to provide proper care and husbandry or horticultural practices.

(1) All persons who would be receiving a specimen must be identified in an application and their facilities approved by us, including persons who are likely to receive a specimen within 1 year after it arrives in the United States.

(2) The applicant must provide sufficient information for us to make a finding, including, but not limited to, a description of the facility, photographs, or construction plans, and resumes of the recipient or staff who will care for the specimen.

(3) We use the best available information on the requirements of the species in making a decision and will consult with experts and other Federal and State agencies, as necessary and appropriate.

(4) The degree of scrutiny that we give an application is based on the biological and husbandry or horticultural needs of the species.
