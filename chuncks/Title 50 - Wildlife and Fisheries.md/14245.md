###### Signals.

(d)The following signals, extracted from the International Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal "L" and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly.

(1) "AA" repeated (.- .-) is the call to an unknown station. The operator of the signaled vessel should respond by identifying the vessel by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's identification.

(2) "RY-CY" (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means "you should proceed at slow speed, a boat is coming to you." This signal is normally employed when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or, in some cases, without retrieval of fishing gear that may be in the water.

(3) "SQ3" (... --.- ...--) means "you should stop or heave to; I am going to board you."
