###### Additional information or evidence.

(5)The Regional Administrator will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an applicant's inconsistent claims submitted prior to or within the 30-day evidentiary period. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application are correct, the official crab rationalization record will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether the applicant is eligible for QS or PQS. However, if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application are correct, the applicant will be notified by an IAD, that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to change the information in the official crab rationalization record.
