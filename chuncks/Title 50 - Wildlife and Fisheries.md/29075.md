##### Hopper scale-

A scale designed for weighing individual loads of a bulk commodity (fish). The load receiver is a cylindrical or rectangular container mounted on a weighing element. The weighing element may be mechanical levers, a combination of levers and a load cell, or all load cells. The capacity can vary from less than 20 kg to greater than 50 mt. The loads are applied from a bulk source by such means as a conveyor or storage hopper. Each step of the weighing process, that is the loading and unloading of the weigh hopper, is controlled by an operator.
