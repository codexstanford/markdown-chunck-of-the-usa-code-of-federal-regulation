##### § 648.11 Monitoring coverage.
###### Gear-based exclusion from the at-sea monitoring program.

(ii)A sector vessel that notifies NMFS of its intent to exclusively fish using gillnets with a mesh size of 10-inch (25.4-cm) or greater in either the Inshore Georges Bank (GB) Stock Area, as defined at § 648.10(k)(3)(ii), and/or the Southern New England (SNE) Broad Stock Area, as defined at § 648.10(k)(3)(iv), is not subject to the coverage level for at-sea monitoring specified in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section provided that the trip is limited to the Inshore GB and/or SNE Broad Stock Areas and that the vessel only uses gillnets with a mesh size of 10-inches (25.4-cm) or greater. When on such a trip, other gear may be on board provided that it is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in § 648.2. A sector trip fishing with 10-inch (25.4-cm) mesh or larger gillnets will still be subject to at-sea monitoring coverage if the trip declares its intent to fish in any part of the trip in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) Stock area, as defined at § 648.10(k)(3)(i), or the Offshore GB Stock Area, as defined at § 648.10(k)(3)(iii). Vessels using electronic monitoring to satisfy the sector monitoring requirement in this section must have their system turned on and comply with their vessel monitoring plan on all trips, including a trip that is limited to the Inshore GB and/or SNE Broad Stock Areas where the vessel only uses gillnets with a mesh size of 10-inches (25.4-cm) or greater.
