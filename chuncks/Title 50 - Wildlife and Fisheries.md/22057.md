Based on catch projections in relation to the amount of catch available between the applicable 90 percent (Phase 1) and 98 percent (Phase 2) sub-ACL adjustment thresholds, NMFS may bypass implementing this Phase 1, 40,000-lb (18,143.7-kg) possession limit and instead implement the Phase 2, 2,000-lb (907.2-kg) possession limit described at ยง 648.201(a)(1)(i)(B)() as warranted to avoid impracticable transitions from Phase 1 to Phase 2 thresholds, avoid overages, or reduce the risk of exceeding the ABC. NMFS shall implement these restrictions in accordance with the APA.
