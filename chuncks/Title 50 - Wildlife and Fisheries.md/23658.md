The Observer Program may issue waivers to the observer provider to allow observers to work more than 22 calendar days per month in the following circumstances:

(A) When it's anticipated that one trip will last over 20 days.

(B) When a replacement observer is not available due to injury or illness.

(C) When the Observer Program has predetermined that the extended deployment is not likely to result in data delays or otherwise impact the overall duties and obligations of the observer.
