###### Adjustment process.

(1)The MAFMC shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions over the span of at least two MAFMC meetings. The MAFMC must provide the public with advance notice of the availability of the recommendation(s), appropriate justification(s) and economic and biological analyses, and the opportunity to comment on the proposed adjustment(s) at the first meeting and prior to and at the second MAFMC meeting. The MAFMC's recommendations on adjustments or additions to management measures must come from one or more of the following categories:

(i) Adjustments within existing ABC control rule levels;

(ii) Adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy;

(iii) Introduction of new AMs, including sub-ACTs;

(iv) Minimum and maximum fish size;

(v) Gear restrictions, gear requirements or prohibitions;

(vi) Permitting restrictions;

(vii) Recreational possession limit, recreational seasons, and recreational harvest limit;

(viii) Closed areas;

(ix) Commercial seasons, commercial trip limits, commercial quota system, including commercial quota allocation procedure and possible quota set-asides to mitigate bycatch;

(x) Annual specification quota setting process;

(xi) FMP Monitoring Committee composition and process;

(xii) Description and identification of EFH (and fishing gear management measures that impact EFH);

(xiii) Description and identification of habitat areas of particular concern;

(xiv) Overfishing definition and related thresholds and targets;

(xv) Regional gear restrictions, regional season restrictions (including option to split seasons), regional management;

(xvi) Restrictions on vessel size (LOA and GRT) or shaft horsepower;

(xvii) Changes to the SBRM, including the CV-based performance standard, the means by which discard data are collected/obtained, fishery stratification, the process for prioritizing observer sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or observer set aside programs;

(xviii) Set aside quota for scientific research;

(xix) Process for inseason adjustment to the annual specification;

(xx) Mortality caps for river herring and shad species, time/area management for river herring and shad species, and provisions for river herring and shad incidental catch avoidance program, including adjustments to the mechanism and process for tracking fleet activity, reporting incidental catch events, compiling data, and notifying the fleet of changes to the area(s);

(xxi) The definition/duration of `test tows,' if test tows would be utilized to determine the extent of river herring incidental catch in a particular area(s);

(xxii) The threshold for river herring incidental catch that would trigger the need for vessels to be alerted and move out of the area(s), the distance that vessels would be required to move from the area(s), and the time that vessels would be required to remain out of the area(s);

(xxiii) Modifications to the broad and discrete deep-sea coral zone boundaries and the addition of discrete deep-sea coral zones;

(xxiv) Modifications to the management measures within the Frank R. Lautenberg Deep-sea Coral Protection Area and implementation of special access programs to the Frank R. Lautenberg Deep-sea Coral Protection Area; and

(xxv) Any other management measures currently included in the FMP.

(2) Measures contained within this list that require significant departures from previously contemplated measures or that are otherwise introducing new concepts may require amendment of the FMP instead of a framework adjustment.
