##### General.

3.3.1.1a. A hopper scale must be equipped with an indicator and printer that indicates and prints the weight of each load and a no-load reference value; and a printer that prints the total weight of fish in each haul or set and the total cumulative weight of all fish and other material weighed on the scale between annual inspections ("the cumulative weight"). The indications and printed information must be clear, definite, accurate, and easily read under all conditions of normal operation of the hopper scale.

b. A no-load reference value may be a positive or negative value in terms of scale divisions or zero. When the no-load reference value is zero, the scale must return to a zero indication (within +/-0.5 scale division) when the load receptor (hopper) is empty following the discharge of all loads, without the intervention of either automatic or manual means.
