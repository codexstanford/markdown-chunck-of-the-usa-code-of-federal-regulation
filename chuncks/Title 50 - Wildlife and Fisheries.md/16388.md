###### "CANCEL".

(11)Each operator wanting to "CANCEL" a previous report may do so by sending a revised message, and inserting the word "CANCEL" in front of the previous report's vessel name, IRCS, date, time and action code canceled (action code "CANCEL"). The message must be transmitted and delivered prior to the date and time of the event in the original message.

(d) The operator of an FFV will be in violation of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section if the FFV does not pass within 5 nautical miles (9.26 km) of the position given in the report within 4 hours of the time given in the report.

(e) The notices required by this section may be provided for individual or groups of FFV's (on a vessel-by-vessel basis) by authorized persons. An FFV operator may retransmit reports on the behalf of another FFV, if authorized by that FFV's operator. This does not relieve the individual vessel operator of the responsibility of filing required reports. In these cases, the message format should be modified so that each line of text under "VESREP" is a separate vessel report.
