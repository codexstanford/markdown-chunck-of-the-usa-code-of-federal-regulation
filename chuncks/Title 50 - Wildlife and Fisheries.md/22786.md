###### Restriction on frequency of changes in vessel registration,General.

(vii)-(A)A permit owner may designate the vessel registration for a permit as "unidentified," meaning that no vessel has been identified as registered for use with that permit. No vessel is authorized to use a permit with the vessel registration designated as "unidentified." A vessel owner who removes a permit from his vessel and registers that permit as "unidentified" is not exempt from VMS requirements at ยง 660.14, unless specifically authorized by that section. When a permit owner requests that the permit's vessel registration be designated as "unidentified," the transaction is not considered a change in vessel registration for purposes of this section. Any subsequent request by a permit owner to change from the "unidentified" status of the permit in order to register the permit with a specific vessel will be considered a change in vessel registration and subject to the restriction on frequency and timing of changes in vessel registration.
