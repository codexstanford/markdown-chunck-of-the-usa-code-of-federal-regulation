###### MS coop failure

(k)-(1) The Regional Administrator will determine that a permitted MS coop is considered to have failed if:

(i) The coop members dissolve the coop, or

(ii) The coop membership falls below 20 percent of the MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permits, or

(iii) The coop agreement is no longer valid.

(2) If a permitted MS coop dissolves, the designated coop manager must notify NMFS SFD in writing of the dissolution of the coop.

(3) In the event of a NMFS determined coop failure, or reported failure, the designated coop manager will be notified in writing about NMFS' determination. Upon notification of a coop failure, fishing under the MS coop permit will no longer be allowed. Should a coop failure determination be made during the Pacific whiting primary season for the mothership sector, unused allocation associated with the catch history will not be available for harvest by the coop that failed, by any former members of the coop that failed, or any other MS coop for the remainder of that calendar year.
