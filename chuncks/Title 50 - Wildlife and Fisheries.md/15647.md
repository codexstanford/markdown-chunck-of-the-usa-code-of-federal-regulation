###### Special Preservation Area (SPA)

means discrete, biologically important areas of the Monument, identified in the Proclamation, within which uses are subject to conditions, restrictions, and prohibitions, including but not limited to access restrictions. SPAs are used to avoid concentrations of uses that could result in declines in species populations or habitat, to reduce conflicts between uses, to protect areas that are critical for sustaining important marine species or habitats, or to provide opportunities for scientific research. Specific coordinates for Special Preservation Areas within the Monument are found in the Proclamation, and the Special Preservation Areas consist of the areas within the geodetic lines connecting these coordinates. The Special Preservation Areas are depicted on the map in appendix A to part 404.
