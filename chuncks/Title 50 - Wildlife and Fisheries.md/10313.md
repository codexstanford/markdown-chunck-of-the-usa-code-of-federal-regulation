####### e.g.,

(2) Type and size of pile being driven, substrate type, method of driving during recordings (hammer model and energy), and total pile driving duration;

(i) Whether a sound attenuation device is used and, if so, a detailed description of the device used and the duration of its use per pile;

(ii) For impact pile driving (per pile): Number of strikes and strike rate; depth of substrate to penetrate; pulse duration and mean, median, and maximum sound levels (dB re: 1 µPa): Root mean square sound pressure level (SPLrms); cumulative sound exposure level (SELcum), peak sound pressure level (SPLpeak), and single-strike sound exposure level (SELs-s);

(iii) For vibratory driving/removal (per pile): Duration of driving per pile; mean, median, and maximum sound levels (dB re: 1 µPa): Root mean square sound pressure level (SPLrms), cumulative sound exposure level (SELcum) (and timeframe over which the sound is averaged); and

(iv) One-third octave band spectrum and power spectral density plot.
