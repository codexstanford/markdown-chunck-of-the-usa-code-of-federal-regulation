####### e.g.,

(2) Type and size of pile being driven, substrate type, method of driving during recordings (hammer model and energy), and total pile driving duration;

(3) Whether a sound attenuation device is used and, if so, a detailed description of the device used and the duration of its use per pile;

(4) For impact pile driving and/or DTH excavation (DTH mono-hammer and cluster drill) (per pile/hole): Number of strikes and strike rate; depth of substrate to penetrate; pulse duration and mean, median, and maximum sound levels (dB re: 1 µPa): root mean square sound pressure level (SPLrms); cumulative sound exposure level (SELcum), peak sound pressure level (SPLpeak), and single-strike sound exposure level (SELss);

(5) For vibratory driving/removal, rotary drilling, and/or DTH excavation (DTH mono-hammer and cluster drill) (per pile/hole): Duration of driving per pile; mean, median, and maximum sound levels (dB re: 1 µPa): root mean square sound pressure level (SPLrms), cumulative sound exposure level (SELcum) (and timeframe over which the sound is averaged);

(6) One-third octave band spectrum and power spectral density plot; and
