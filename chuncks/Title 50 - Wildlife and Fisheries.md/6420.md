Wildlife refuge areas may be opened to sport fishing only after a determination is made that this activity is compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established.

Lands acquired as "waterfowl production areas" are open to sport fishing subject to the provisions of State laws and regulations and the pertinent provisions of parts 25 through 31 of this subchapter:that fishing or entry on all or any part of individual areas may be temporarily suspended by posting upon occasions of unusual or critical conditions of, or affecting, land, water, vegetation or fish and wildlife populations.
