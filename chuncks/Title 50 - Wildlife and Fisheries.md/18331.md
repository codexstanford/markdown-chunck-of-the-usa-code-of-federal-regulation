(2)As described in the FMP, if average annual recreational landings, when determined using 3-year geometric mean, exceed the recreational ACL of 2,814,613 lb (1,276,687 kg), round weight, then in the following fishing year, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the length of the recreational fishing season by the amount necessary to ensure that the recreational ACL is not exceeded during the fishing year following the recreational ACL overage determination. However, the length of the recreational fishing season will not be reduced in the following fishing year if NMFS determines, based on the best scientific information available, that the reduction in the recreational fishing season is unnecessary.
