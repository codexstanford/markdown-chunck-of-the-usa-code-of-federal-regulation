###### Chinook salmon bycatch guidelines and Chinook salmon bycatch reserve.

(2)The Chinook salmon bycatch guideline for the non-whiting sector is 5,500 fish. The Chinook salmon bycatch guideline for the whiting sector is 11,000 fish. If a sector exceeds its Chinook salmon bycatch guideline, it may access a reserve of 3,500 Chinook salmon reserve provided action has been taken to minimize Chinook salmon bycatch as described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. For bycatch accounting purposes, all Chinook salmon bycatch from the groundfish fishery, including both non-tribal and Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries, counts towards the applicable whiting or non-whiting sector bycatch guideline and the reserve.
