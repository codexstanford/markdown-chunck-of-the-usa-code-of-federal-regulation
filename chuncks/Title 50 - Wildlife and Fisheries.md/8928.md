###### ยง 86.74 How do I determine the useful life of a BIG-funded facility?
####### capital improvement

(i) Use the definition ofat ยง 86.3.

(ii) The capital improvement must be a structure or system that serves an identified purpose.

(iii) Consider the function of the components in your application and group those with a similar purpose together as structures or systems.

(iv) All auxiliary components of your project (those that are not directly part of the structure or system) must be identified as necessary for the continued use of an identified capital improvement. For example, a gangway is not part of the dock system, but is necessary for access to and from the dock system, so it could be included in the useful life of the dock system.

(v) Attach an auxiliary component as identified at paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section to only one capital improvement. If it supports more than one, choose the one with the longest useful life.

(vi) Examples of structures or systems that could potentially make up a single capital improvement are a: Rest room/shower building; dock system; breakwater; seawall; basin, as altered by dredging; or fuel station.
