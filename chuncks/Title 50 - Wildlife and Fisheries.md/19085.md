###### Annual IBQ allocations.

(d)An annual IBQ allocation is the amount of BFT (whole weight) in metric tons corresponding to an IBQ shareholder's share percentage, distributed to their vessel to account for incidental landings and dead discards of BFT during a specified calendar year. NMFS will only distribute IBQ allocations when there is a valid Atlantic Tunas Longline category LAP associated with a vessel. Unless otherwise required under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, an IBQ allocation is derived by multiplying the IBQ share percentage (calculated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) by the baseline Longline category quota for that year. If the baseline quota is adjusted during the fishing year, the annual IBQ allocation may also be adjusted as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
