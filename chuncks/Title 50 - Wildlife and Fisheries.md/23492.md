###### i,Whiting QS allocated based on each permit's history.

()Whiting QS based on each limited entry trawl permit's history will be allocated based on the permit's relative history from 1994 through 2003. For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will calculate a whiting relative history for each qualifying year, as follows. First, NMFS will sum the permit's history of landings of whiting from whiting trips for each year. Second, NMFS will divide each permit's annual sum of whiting from whiting trips by the shoreside limited entry trawl fleet's annual sum of whiting. NMFS will then calculate a total relative history for each permit by adding all relative histories for the permit together and subtracting the two years with the lowest relative history. NMFS will then divide the result for each permit by the total relative history for whiting of all qualifying limited entry trawl permits. The result from this calculation will then be multiplied by the amount of whiting QS in the pool to be allocated based on each permit's history.
