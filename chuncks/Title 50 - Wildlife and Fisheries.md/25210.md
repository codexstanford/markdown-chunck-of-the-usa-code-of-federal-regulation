###### Transfer or sale of limited access permits.

(e)(1) Permits may be transferred or sold, but no one individual, partnership, or corporation will be allowed to hold a whole or partial interest in more than one permit, except that an owner who qualifies initially for more than one permit may maintain those permits, but may not obtain additional permits. Layering of partnerships or corporations shall not insulate a permit holder from this requirement.

(2) If 50 percent or more of the ownership of a limited access permit is passed to persons other than those listed on the permit application, PIRO must be notified of the change in writing and provided copies of the appropriate documents confirming the changes within 30 days.

(3) Upon the transfer or sale of a limited access permit, a new application must be submitted by the new permit owner according to the requirements of ยง 665.13. The transferred permit is not valid until this process is completed.
