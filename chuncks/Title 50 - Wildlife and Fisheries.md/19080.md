###### Proxy calculation for Deepwater Horizon Oceanic Fish Restoration Project participants.

(2)For valid participants in this Project, the annual IBQ shares will be calculated as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but in addition, a proxy amount of sets will be added to a vessel's history during the period of its participation in the Project.
