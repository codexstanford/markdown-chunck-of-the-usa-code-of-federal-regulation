####### Artificially propagated criteria.

(c)Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, for a plant specimen to qualify as artificially propagated, we must be satisfied that the plant specimen was grown under controlled conditions from a seed, cutting, division, callus tissue, other plant tissue, spore, or other propagule that either is exempt from the provisions of CITES or has been derived from cultivated parental stock. The cultivated parental stock must meet all of the following criteria:

(1) Was established in accordance with the provisions of CITES and relevant national laws.

(2) Was established in a manner not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.

(3) Is maintained in sufficient quantities for propagation so as to minimize or eliminate the need for augmentation from the wild, with such augmentation occurring only as an exception and limited to the amount necessary to maintain the vigor and productivity of the cultivated parental stock.
