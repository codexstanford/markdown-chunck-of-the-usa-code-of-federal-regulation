##### Platform scale-

A scale by the nature of its physical size, arrangement of parts, and relatively small capacity (generally 220 kg or less) that is adapted for use on a bench or counter or on the floor. A platform scale can be self contained, that is, the indicator and load receiver and weighing elements are all comprised of a single unit, or the indicator can be connected by cable to a separate load receiver and weighing element. The technology used may be mechanical, electro-mechanical, or electronic. Loads are applied manually.
