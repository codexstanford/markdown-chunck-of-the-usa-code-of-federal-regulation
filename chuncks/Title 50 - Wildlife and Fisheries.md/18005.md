###### Longline prohibited areas.

(b)A longline may not be used to fish in the EEZ for South Atlantic snapper-grouper south of 27&#xB0;10&#x2032; N. lat. (due east of the entrance to St. Lucie Inlet, FL); or north of 27&#xB0;10&#x2032; N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), as shown on the latest edition of the largest scale NOAA chart of the location. A person aboard a vessel with a longline on board that fishes on a trip in the South Atlantic EEZ south of 27&#xB0;10&#x2032; N. lat., or north of 27&#xB0;10&#x2032; N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), is limited on that trip to the bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper for which a bag limit is specified in ยง 622.187(b), and to zero for all other South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purpose of this paragraph, a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and gangions are on board. Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a longline.
