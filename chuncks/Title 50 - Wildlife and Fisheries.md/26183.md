###### Additional information or evidence.

(vi)The Regional Administrator will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an applicant's inconsistent claims submitted within the 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the official LLP record will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether the applicant is eligible for a license. However, if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the applicant will be notified by an initial administrative determination, pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(viii) of this section, that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to change the information in the official LLP record.
