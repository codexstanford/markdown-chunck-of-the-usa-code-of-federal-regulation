##### ยง 660.140 Shorebased IFQ Program.
###### Non-whiting QP annual sub-allocations.

(A)NMFS will issue QP for IFQ species other than Pacific whiting and Pacific halibut annually by multiplying the QS permit owner's QS for each such IFQ species by that year's shorebased trawl allocation for that IFQ species. Deposits to QS accounts for IFQ species other than Pacific whiting and Pacific halibut will be made on or about January 1 each year. Until the implementation of any regulatory changes developed pursuant to the first program review for the trawl rationalization program, the resulting AMP QP will be issued to all QS permit owners in proportion to their non-whiting QS.
