####### Possession

means the detention and control, or the manual or ideal custody of anything that may be the subject of property, for one's use and enjoyment, either as owner or as the proprietor of a qualified right in it, and either held personally or by another who exercises it in one's place and name. Possession includes the act or state of possessing and that condition of facts under which persons can exercise their power over a corporeal thing at their pleasure to the exclusion of all other persons. Possession includes constructive possession that which means not an actual but an assumed existence one claims to hold by virtue of some title, without having actual custody.
