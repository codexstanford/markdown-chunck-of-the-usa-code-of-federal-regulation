##### ยง 648.20 Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) control rules.
###### ABC control rule for a stock with an OFL probability distribution that is modified by the SSC.

(c)(1) The SSC determines the assessment OFL is acceptable but the SSC derives the appropriate uncertainty for OFL based on meta-analysis and other considerations. This requires the SSC to determine that the stock assessment does not contain an estimated probability distribution of OFL or the OFL probability distribution in the stock assessment is judged by the SSC to not adequately reflect uncertainty in the OFL estimate.

(2) An ABC for stocks with an OFL probability distribution that is modified by the SSC will be determined by either:

(i) Applying the acceptable probability of overfishing from the MAFMC's risk policy found in ยง 648.21(a) through (d) to the SSC-adjusted OFL probability distribution. The SSC will use default assignments of uncertainty in the adjusted OFL probability distribution based on literature review and valuation of control rule performance; or,

(ii) If the SSC cannot develop an OFL probability distribution, a default control rule of 75 percent of the Fvalue will be applied to derive ABC.
