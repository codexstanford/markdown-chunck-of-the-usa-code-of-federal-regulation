(v)For the purposes of this rule, native haylands do not include lands that had previously been plowed and were then replanted to native or nonnative vegetation, but native haylands do include areas within transportation (e.g., road, highway, railroad) rights-of-ways and corridors where native grasses are mowed for hay. Haying of native haylands no earlier than July 16 (after July 15) would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act. Mowing of replanted grasslands (grasslands replanted on formerly plowed or cultivated lands) or tame haylands or grasslands (planted hayland or grassland comprising primarily nonnative grass species, such as smooth brome ()) would also not be a violation of section 9 of the Act at any time of the year.
