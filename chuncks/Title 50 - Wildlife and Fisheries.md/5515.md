####### Issuance criteria.

(c)The Director will not issue a permit to take bald or golden eagles unless the Director has determined that such taking is compatible with the preservation of the bald or golden eagle. In making such determination, the Director will consider the following:

(1) The direct or indirect effect which issuing such permit would be likely to have upon the wild population of bald or golden eagles;

(2) Whether evidence shows that bald or golden eagles have in fact become seriously injurious to wildlife or to agriculture or other interests in the particular locality to be covered by the permit and the injury complained of is substantial, or that bald or golden eagles pose a significant risk to human or eagle health and safety; and

(3) Whether the only way to abate or prevent the damage caused by the bald or golden eagle is to take some or all of the offending birds.
