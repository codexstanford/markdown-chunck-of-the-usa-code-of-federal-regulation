() For limited entry trawl permits where the vessel registered to the permit did not submit logbooks showing any catch of either of the two target species for any of the years 2003 through 2006, NMFS will use the following formula to calculate area target catch ratios: NMFS will sum by area all limited entry trawl permits' total logbook area target catches from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section, and sum all limited entry trawl permits' total logbook target catches across all four areas from paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section; and divide these sums to create average permit logbook area target catch ratios.
