(A) Channel restoration projects that create natural, physically stable, ecologically functioning streams. These projects can be accomplished using a variety of methods, but the desired outcome is a natural channel with geomorphically stable stream channels that maintain the appropriate lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation and include stable riffle-run-pool complexes that consist of silt-free gravel, coarse sand, cobble, boulders, woody structure, and river weed (spp.).

(B) Streambank stabilization projects that use bioengineering methods to replace pre-existing, bare, eroding stream banks with natively vegetated, stable stream banks, thereby reducing bank erosion and instream sedimentation and improving habitat conditions for the DPS. Stream banks may be stabilized using native live stakes (live, vegetative cuttings inserted or tamped into the ground in a manner that allows the stake to take root and grow), native live fascines (live branch cuttings, usually willows, bound together into long, cigar-shaped bundles), or native brush layering (cuttings or branches of easily rooted tree species layered between successive lifts of soil fill). Stream banks must not be stabilized solely through the use of quarried rock (rip-rap) or the use of rock baskets or gabion structures.

(C) Projects carried out in the DPS's range under the Working Lands for Wildlife program of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or similar projects conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program or the Environmental Protection Agency's 319 Grant Program, that are implemented with a primary objective of improving environmental conditions to support the native, aquatic biodiversity of flowing water habitats.

(D) Silviculture practices and forest management activities that implement State-approved best management practices to protect water and sediment quality and stream and riparian habitat.

(v) Possess and engage in other acts with unlawfully taken wildlife, as set forth at ยง 17.21(d)(2) for endangered wildlife.
