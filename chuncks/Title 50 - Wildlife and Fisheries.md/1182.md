####### Initial reporting period.

(iv)Until September 6, 2005, no threatened species permits will be required for the import, export, re-export, or interstate or foreign commerce of beluga sturgeon caviar and meat that originated in the littoral states, in order to provide the littoral states time to submit the required documentation. After this 6-month period, the exemption from threatened species permits will continue only while the Service reviews littoral state compliance with paragraphs (y)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. If this review demonstrates that the provisions of this special rule are not met, the Service will announce and institute trade restrictions or suspensions in beluga sturgeon caviar or meat with one or more littoral states as per paragraph (y)(7) of this section.
