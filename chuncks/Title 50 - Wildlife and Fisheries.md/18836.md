##### Hook end.

(a)This device, such as a standard boat hook or gaff must be constructed of stainless steel or aluminum; if a long-handled J-style dehooker is used to comply with this requirement, it must be constructed of 316L or 304L stainless steel. The semicircular or "J" shaped hook end must be securely attached to the handle to allow the hook end to engage and pull an "inverted V" in the fishing line. A gaff or any other tool with a sharp point is to be used only for holding fishing lines and must never contact the sea turtle.
