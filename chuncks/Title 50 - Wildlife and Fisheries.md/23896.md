###### Multiple MS/CV endorsements on a limited entry trawl permit.

(A)Multiple MS/CV endorsements and associated CHAs may be registered to a single limited entry trawl permit. If multiple endorsements are registered to a single limited entry trawl permit, the whiting CHA amount (expressed as a percent) will remain in the amount that it was originally issued by NMFS and will not be combined as a single larger CHA, unless two or more MS/CV-endorsed permits are combined for purposes of increasing the size endorsement, as specified at ยง 660.25(b)(4)(ii)(B). Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration may be disapproved if the person owning the limited entry trawl permit has aggregate CHA amounts in excess of the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
