###### General applicability and monitoring of AMs.

(4)At or near the beginning the fishing year, landings for each stock, stock complex, or indicator stock will be evaluated relative to the ACL based on a moving multi-year average of landings, as described in the FMP. When landings for one sector are not available for comparison to that sector's ACL, the ACL for the sector with available landings is the ACL for the stock or stock complex and the AM specified in paragraph (a)(7) of this section applies. Any fishing season reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section will be applied starting from September 30 and moving earlier toward the beginning of the fishing year. If the length of the required fishing season reduction exceeds the time period of January 1 through September 30, any additional fishing season reduction will be applied starting from October 1 and moving later toward the end of the fishing year.
