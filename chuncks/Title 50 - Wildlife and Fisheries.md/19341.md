Effective upon the date of filing of such finding, all shipments of fish in any form of the species found to be ineligible will be denied entry unless, with respect to a particular shipment, it is established by satisfactory proof pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section that the particular shipment of fish is eligible for entry. Entry will not be denied and no such proof will be required for any such shipment that, on the date of filing was in transit to the United States on board a vessel operating as a common carrier.
