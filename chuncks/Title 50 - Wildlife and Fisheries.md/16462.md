### PART 600 - MAGNUSON-STEVENS ACT PROVISIONS
#### Subpart F - Foreign Fishing
##### ยง 600.520 Northwest Atlantic Ocean fishery.
###### Closures.

(5)The taking of any species for which a Nation has an allocation is permitted, provided that:

(i) The vessels of the foreign nation have not caught the allocation of that Nation for any species or species group (e.g., "other finfish"). When vessels of a foreign nation have caught an applicable allocation of any species, all further fishing other than scouting, processing, or support by vessels of that Nation must cease, even if other allocations have not been reached. Therefore, it is essential that foreign nations plan their fishing strategy to ensure that the reaching of an allocation for one species does not result in the premature closing of a Nation's fishery for other allocated species.

(ii) The fishery has not been closed for other reasons under ยง 600.511.
