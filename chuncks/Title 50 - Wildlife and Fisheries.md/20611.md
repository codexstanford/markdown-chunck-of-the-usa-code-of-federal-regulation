###### Stocks under a rebuilding plan.

(a)The probability of not exceeding the F necessary to rebuild the stock within the specified time frame (rebuilding F or F) must be at least 50 percent, unless the default level is modified to a higher probability for not exceeding the rebuilding F through the formal stock rebuilding plan. A higher probability of not exceeding the rebuilding F would be expressed as a value greater than 50 percent (e.g., 75-percent probability of not exceeding rebuilding F, which corresponds to a 25-percent probability of exceeding rebuilding F).
