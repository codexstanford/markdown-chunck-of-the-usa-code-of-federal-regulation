####### How will the Service set trade restrictions or prohibitions under the special rule?,i.e.

(7)The Service's Division of Scientific Authority will conduct a biennial review of beluga sturgeon conservation based on information in the cooperative basin-wide management plans, national regulations and laws, and biennial reports (submitted as per paragraph (y)(4) of this section, and, for aquaculture facilities, as per paragraph (y)(5)(iv) of this section). We will combine that review with a review of other relevant information (e.g., scientific literature, law enforcement data, government-to-government consultations) to determine whether littoral state management programs and aquaculture operations are effectively achieving conservation benefits for beluga sturgeon. Based on this information, or the failure to obtain it, the Service may restrict or prohibit trade from a littoral state, a re-exporting intermediary country, or an entire basin (, the Caspian Sea or Black Sea) or a specific aquaculture facility outside the littoral states if we determine that the conservation or management status of beluga sturgeon has been adversely affected and the continued recovery of beluga sturgeon may be compromised. The decision to restrict or prohibit trade in beluga sturgeon products on a national, basin, or region-wide scale will depend on the scope of the problem observed, the magnitude of the threat to wild beluga sturgeon, and whether remedial action is necessary at a national, basin, or region-wide scale.

(i) Trade restrictions or suspensions will result basin-wide, for specific littoral states, or for non-littoral state aquaculture facilities under one or more of the following scenarios:

(A) Failure to submit any of the reports, legislation, and management plans described in paragraph (y)(4) of this section, or failure to respond to requests for additional information;

(B) A change in regional cooperative management that threatens the recovery of wild beluga sturgeon;

(C) A change in littoral state laws or regulations that compromises beluga sturgeon recovery or survival in the wild;

(D) Adoption of scientifically unsound hatchery practices or restocking programs for beluga sturgeon;
