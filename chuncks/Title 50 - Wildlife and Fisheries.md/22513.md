(4)For a minimum of one year from the effective date of the final rule, vessels subject to this non-trawl logbook requirement are permitted to submit a paper logbook form in lieu of the requirement to fill out the non-trawl electronic logbook application.

NMFS will issue a public notice at least 90 calendar days prior to ending the optional provision to submit a paper logbook. The authorized representative of the vessel must complete the non-trawl logbook form on all groundfish trips, subject to the same requirements as for the non-trawl electronic logbook application, listed above in ยง 660.13(a)(3)(i) through (ii).

The authorized representative of the vessel responsible for submitting the non-trawl logbook forms must maintain a copy of all submitted logbooks for a minimum of three years after the fishing activity ended.
