###### Set

means a string of longline gear, a string of pots, or a group of pots with individual pots deployed and retrieved in the water in a similar location with similar soak time. In the case of pot gear, when the pots in a string are hauled more than once in the same position, a new set is created each time the string is retrieved and re-deployed. A set includes a test set, unsuccessful harvest, or when gear is not working and is pulled in, even if no fish are harvested.
