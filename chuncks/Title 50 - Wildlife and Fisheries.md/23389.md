###### Reallocation with subdivision of a species group.

(B)If at any time after the initial allocation an IFQ species which is a species group is subdivided, each species or species group resulting from the subdivision will be an IFQ species. QS owners for the species group being subdivided will receive an amount of QS for each newly created IFQ species that is equivalent to the amount they held for the species group before it was subdivided. For example, if a person holds one percent of a species group before the subdivision, that person will hold one percent of the QS for each IFQ species resulting from the subdivision.
