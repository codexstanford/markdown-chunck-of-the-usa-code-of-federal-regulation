(ii)NMFS permit records would be the sole basis for determining permit transfers, permit renewals, and the validity of permits. NMFS will only use the relevant 36 months of data described under paragraph (c) of this section to determine the numbers of pelagic longline sets made. NMFS will count only pelagic longline sets legally made when the permit holder had a valid permit. No other proof of sets or permit history will be considered. Photocopies of written documents are acceptable; NMFS may request originals at a later date. NMFS may refer any submitted materials that are of questionable authenticity to the NMFS Office of Law Enforcement for investigation into potential violations of Federal law.
