####### Recertification of compliance with this section if a State's, tribe's, or territory's falconry permitting authority has been suspended.

(7)If a State, tribe, or territory has had its falconry permitting authority suspended but has corrected its problems, it must submit a request for approval of its permitting activities. We will then either recertify the program, or report in writing why we do not believe that earlier permitting problems have been rectified.
