###### Butterfish allocation transfer.

(5)NMFS may transfer up to 50 percent of any unused butterfish allocation from the butterfish DAH to the butterfish discard cap on the longfin squid fishery if the butterfish catch in the longfin squid fishery is likely to result in a closure of the longfin squid fishery, and provided the transfer does not increase the likelihood of closing the directed butterfish fishery. NMFS may instead transfer up to 50 percent of the unused butterfish catch from the butterfish discard cap allocation to the butterfish DAH if harvest of butterfish in the directed butterfish fishery is likely to exceed the butterfish DAH, and provided the transfer of butterfish allocation from the butterfish discard cap allocation does not increase the likelihood of closing the longfin squid fishery due to harvest of the butterfish discard cap. NMFS would make this transfer on or about November 15 each fishing year, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
