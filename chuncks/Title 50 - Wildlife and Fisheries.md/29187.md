b. The field strength must be generated in two orthogonal polarizations and the frequency range scanned slowly. If antennas with circular polarization,log-spiral or helical antennas, are used to generate the electromagnetic field, a change in the position of the antennas is not required. When the test is carried out in a shielded enclosure to comply with international laws prohibiting interference to radio communications, care needs to be taken to handle reflections from the walls. Anechoic shielding might be necessary.

a. Normal power supplied and "on" for a time period equal to or greater than the warm-up time specified by the manufacturer. Power is to be "on" for the duration of the test. The EUT must be operating under standard atmospheric conditions for testing.

b. Adjust the EUT as close to a zero indication as practicable prior to the test.

a. Stabilize all factors at nominal reference conditions.

b. Conduct the test as indicated in this A.3.7 Test Sequence section and record the-

i. Date and time,

ii. Temperature,

iii. Relative humidity,

iv. Test load,

v. Indication,

vi. Errors, and

vii. Functions performance.

c. Following the IEC test procedures, expose the EUT at zero load to the specified field strengths while slowly scanning the three indicated frequency ranges.

d. Observe and record the effect on the EUT.

e. Repeat the test and observe and record the effect.

f. Stabilize all factors at nominal reference conditions.

g. Repeat the test and record the test data.
