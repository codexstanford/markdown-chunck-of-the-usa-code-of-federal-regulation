###### Allocation of Pacific halibut IBQ for each limited entry trawl permit.,3,6,7,13,14,16

(H)For each eligible limited entry trawl permit owner, NMFS will calculate Pacific halibut individual bycatch quota (IBQ) for the area north of 40&#xB0;10&#x2032; N. lat. using a formula based on (a) QS allocations for each limited entry trawl permit for two target species, (b) areas of distribution of fishing effort as determined from 2003-2006 target species catch data from the PacFIN Coastwide Trawl Logbook Database, (c) average bycatch ratios for each area as derived from WCGOP data from 2003 through 2006, and (d) the non-whiting initial issuance allocation of the limited entry trawl allocation amounts for 2011 for arrowtooth and petrale sole. These data are used in a series of sequential steps to determine the allocation of IBQ to each limited entry trawl permit. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(H)() to () of this section estimate the permit's total 2003-2006 target species by area. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(H)() to () of this section project Pacific halibut bycatch amounts using 2003-2006 WCGOP observer ratios and the 2011 non-whiting initial issuance allocation of the limited entry trawl allocation amounts. Paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(H)() to () of this section convert these amounts into QS.
