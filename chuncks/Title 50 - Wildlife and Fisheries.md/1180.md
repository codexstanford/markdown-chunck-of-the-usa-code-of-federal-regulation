(ii)By September 6, 2005, each littoral state wishing to export beluga caviar or beluga meat to the United States under this special rule must provide the Service's Division of Scientific Authority with copies of national legislation and regulations that implement the basin-wide cooperative management plan described in paragraph (y)(4)(i) of this section, including regulations pertaining to the harvest, trade, aquaculture, restocking, and processing of beluga sturgeon. Upon receipt, the Division of Scientific Authority will review these national laws and regulations within 90 days for completeness and clarity. If any elements of the national legislation or national fishery regulations are missing or unclear, we will ask the appropriate littoral states to provide additional information within 60 days of the date we contact them. If the littoral states fail to respond or fail to submit copies of national laws and regulations by the specified deadline, we will immediately suspend trade with the given littoral states until we are satisfied that such laws and regulations are in effect. Submission of documents in English may help expedite the Service's review.
