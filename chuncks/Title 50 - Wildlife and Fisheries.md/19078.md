###### Annual IBQ share determination.

(c)During the last quarter of each year, NMFS will review the relevant 36 months of best available data to determine eligible IBQ shareholders and the number of pelagic longline sets legally made by each permitted, eligible vessel, and assign IBQ shares based on the criteria below. The 36 month time period is a rolling period that changes annually, and is selected by NMFS based on the availability of recent data and time required by NMFS to conduct determinations under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. NMFS intends to include data from the majority of the year prior to the year for which shares are applied and the IBQ allocation distributed. The best available data as determined by NMFS may be a single data source such as VMS data, for which there is a relatively short time period from the time it is submitted by the vessel operator, and the time it can be used by NMFS; or the best available data may include other available data such as logbook, EM, or permit data, in order to accurately determine a vessel's eligibility status and shares. An IBQ shareholder does not need a valid LAP when NMFS makes annual IBQ share determinations, but NMFS will only distribute IBQ allocations to permitted vessels.
