###### Initial administrative determinations (IAD).

(viii)The Regional will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the applicant fails to support the applicant's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official LLP record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies in the application, including any deficiencies with the information, the evidence submitted in support of the information, or the revised application. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to ยง 679.43. An applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not receive a transferable license until after the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the application.
