() In years where the Pacific halibut total constant exploitation yield is not known by January 1, NMFS will issue QP in two parts. On or about January 1, NMFS will deposit QP based on some portion of the International Pacific Halibut Commission's staff recommended total constant exploitation yield from their interim meeting. After the final Pacific halibut total constant exploitation yield is established from the International Pacific Halibut Commission's annual meeting, NMFS will deposit additional QP to the QS account.
