###### ยง 219.6 Requirements for monitoring and reporting.
####### Reporting.

(e)(1) SWFSC must report all incidents of marine mammal interaction to NMFS's Protected Species Incidental Take database within 48 hours of occurrence and must provide supplemental information to OPR upon request. Information related to marine mammal interaction (animal captured or entangled in research gear) must include details of survey effort, full descriptions of any observations of the animals, the context (vessel and conditions), decisions made, and rationale for decisions made in vessel and gear handling.

(2) SWFSC must submit annual reports including:

(i) An annual summary report to OPR not later than 90 days following the end of a given year. SWFSC must provide a final report within 30 days following resolution of comments on the draft report.

(ii) These reports must contain, at minimum, the following:

(A) Annual line-kilometers surveyed during which predominant active acoustic sources were used;

(B) Summary information regarding use of all hook and line, purse seine, and trawl gear, including number of sets, hook hours, tows, etc., specific to each gear;

(C) Accounts of all incidents of significant marine mammal interactions, including circumstances of the event and descriptions of any mitigation procedures implemented or not implemented and why, and, for interactions due to use of pelagic longline or purse seine, whether the move-on rule was waived due to the presence of five or fewer California sea lions;

(D) Summary information related to any on-ice disturbance of pinnipeds, including raw sightings data and the event-specific total counts of animals present, counts of reactions according to a three-point scale of response severity and numbers of takes (differentiated by species and age class), the distance at which a pinniped is disturbed and the closest point of approach for each disturbance event;

(E) A written evaluation of the effectiveness of SWFSC mitigation strategies in reducing the number of marine mammal interactions with survey gear, including best professional judgment and suggestions for changes to the mitigation strategies, if any;

(F) Final outcome of serious injury determinations for all incidents of marine mammal interactions where the animal(s) were released alive; and

(G) A summary of all relevant training provided by SWFSC and any coordination with NWFSC or NMFS' West Coast Regional Office.
