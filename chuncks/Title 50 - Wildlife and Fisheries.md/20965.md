(D) The quota share and cage tag caps do not apply to a bank or other lender that holds ITQ quota share as collateral on a loan as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this section. The quota share held as collateral and the associated cage tags will be treated as if it is held by the borrower.

(E) Compliance with these ownership caps is based on the total amount of quota share or cage tags controlled throughout a fishing year. In this instance, control means the cumulative total amount of quota share or cage tags, including the amount held by the ITQ permit at the start of the fishing year plus any quota share or cage tags acquired by the ITQ permit throughout the fishing year. This measure of control during the fishing year is increased by acquiring quota share or cage tags from other ITQ permits, but is not reduced by any quota share or cage tags that are transferred to another ITQ permit.
