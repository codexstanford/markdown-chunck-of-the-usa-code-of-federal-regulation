(A) The vessel's color code, as assigned by Florida or, if a color code has not been assigned by Florida, as assigned by the RA, must be permanently and conspicuously displayed above the number specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section so as to be readily identifiable from the air and water, such color code being in the form of a circle at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) in diameter on a background of colors contrasting to those contained in the assigned color code;

(B) A buoy or timed-release buoy of such strength and buoyancy to float must be attached to each spiny lobster trap or at each end of a string of traps;

(C) A buoy used to mark spiny lobster traps must bear the vessel's assigned color code and be of such color, hue, and brilliancy as to be easily distinguished, seen, and located;

(D) A buoy used to mark spiny lobster traps must bear the vessel's Florida crawfish license or trap number or, if not licensed by Florida, the vessel's Federal vessel permit number in numbers at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) high; and
