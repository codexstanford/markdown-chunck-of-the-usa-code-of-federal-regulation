(C)One white-tailed deer. Antlered deer must have at least two points, 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) or more in length on one antler, to be harvested. We issue a limited number of either-sex tags. If you have an either-sex tag, the bag limit is one deer that may be antlerless or antlered with legal antler configuration. State regulations define antlerless deer as deer with no antler or antlers less than 5 inches (12.75 centimeters). Youth age 15 or younger may harvest any deer except spotted fawn. We prohibit harvesting of spotted fawns. There is no limit on feral hog or raccoon.
