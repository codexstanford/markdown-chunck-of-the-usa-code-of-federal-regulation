###### Allocation of initial issuance of whiting QS for shoreside processors.

(G)NMFS will calculate the amount of whiting QS available to shoreside processors from the 20 percent adjustment of whiting QS allocations in paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(F) of this section. For each eligible shoreside processor, whiting QS will be allocated based on the eligible shoreside processor's relative history from 1998 through 2004. Only the deliveries for which the shoreside processor is the first processor of the fish will be used in the calculation of whiting relative history.
