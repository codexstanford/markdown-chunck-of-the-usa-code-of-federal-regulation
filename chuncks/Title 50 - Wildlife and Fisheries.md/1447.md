####### Intentional harassment

means deliberate, preplanned harassment of Mexican wolves, including by less-than-lethal means (such as 12-gauge shotgun rubber-bullets and bean-bag shells) designed to cause physical discomfort and temporary physical injury, but not death. Intentional harassment includes situations where the Mexican wolf or wolves may have been unintentionally attracted-or intentionally tracked, waited for, chased, or searched out-and then harassed. Intentional harassment of Mexican wolves is only allowed under a permit issued by the Service or its designated agency.
