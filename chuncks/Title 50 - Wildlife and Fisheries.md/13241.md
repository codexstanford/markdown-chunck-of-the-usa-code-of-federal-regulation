(4)The nearshore boundary is defined by the 50-m isobath relative to MLLW except, from 38&#xB0; 40&#x2032; N to 36&#xB0; 00&#x2032; N, the nearshore boundary is defined by the 15-m isobath relative to MLLW; and from 36&#xB0; 00&#x2032; N to 34&#xB0; 30&#x2032; N, the nearshore boundary is defined by the 30-m isobath relative to MLLW. North of 40&#xB0; 20&#x2032; N, the offshore boundary of the critical habitat is defined by a line corresponding to the 2,000-m isobath, and from 40&#xB0; 20&#x2032; N to 38&#xB0; 40&#x2032; N, the offshore boundary is defined by the 3,000-m isobath. From 38&#xB0; 40&#x2032; N southward, the remaining areas have an offshore boundary defined by a line corresponding to the 3,700-m isobath.
