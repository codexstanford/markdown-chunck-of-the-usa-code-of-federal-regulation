Maritime forests are defined, for the purposes of this regulation, as broad-leaved forests that occur on barrier islands and along the mainland coast from Delaware to Texas. Examples are primarily characterized by a closed canopy of various combinations of live oak (), upland laurel oak (), pignut hickory (), southern magnolia (), sugarberry (), and cabbage palm (). Shrubs and smaller trees typical of the understory include live oak, upland laurel oak, pignut hickory, red mulberry (), wild olive (), American holly (), yaupon (), beautyberry (), bumelia (spp.), and small-flowered pawpaw (). The herb layer is generally rich and diverse, typically including partridgeberry (), coralbean (), small-leaved milk pea (), tick trefoils (spp.), and spikegrass (). Vines are represented by muscadine grape (), Virginia creeper (), and various briers (spp.).

This natural community type becomes established on old coastal dunes that have been stabilized long enough to sustain forests. In time, the accumulation of humus contributes to moisture retention of soils, while the canopy minimizes temperature fluctuations by reducing soil warming during the day and heat loss at night. Because of the underlying deep sands, maritime forests are generally well-drained.

Maritime forests have become prime resort and residential property because of their relatively protected locations along the coast. Although this community type originally occurred in virtually continuous strips along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, residential developments and infrastructure encroachments have severely fragmented most occurrences.
