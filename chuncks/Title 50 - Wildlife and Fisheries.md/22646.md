##### ยง 660.17 Catch monitor program.
###### Respond to industry requests for catch monitors.

(5)A catch monitor provider must provide a catch monitor for assignment pursuant to the terms of the contractual relationship with the first receiver to fulfill first receiver requirements for catch monitor coverage under ยง 660.140(i)(1). An alternate catch monitor must be supplied in each case where injury or illness prevents the catch monitor from performing his or her duties or where the catch monitor resigns prior to completion of his or her duties. If the catch monitor provider is unable to respond to an industry request for catch monitor coverage from a first receiver for whom the catch monitor provider is in a contractual relationship due to the lack of available catch monitors, the catch monitor provider must report it to NMFS at least four hours prior to the expected assignment time, unless the first receiver provides less than four hour notice to the provider, in which case the provider is to notify the Catch Monitor Program as soon as practical after the situation arises.
