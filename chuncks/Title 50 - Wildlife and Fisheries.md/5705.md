###### ยง 23.46 What are the requirements for registering a commercial breeding operation for Appendix-I wildlife and commercially exporting specimens?
####### U.S. and foreign general provisions for export of specimens that originated in a registered breeding operation.

(h)The following provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of export permits for Appendix-I specimens bred at an operation registered with the CITES Secretariat:

(1) An export permit may be issued to the registered operation or to persons who have purchased a specimen that originated at the registered operation if the specimen has the unique mark applied by the operation. If a microchip is used, we may, if necessary, ask the importer, exporter, or re-exporter to have equipment on hand to read the microchip at the time of import, export, or re-export.

(2) The export permit, and any subsequent re-export certificate, must show the specimen as listed in Appendix I and the source code as "D," and give the identification number of the registered breeding operation where the specimen originated.

(3) No CITES import permit is required for a qualifying specimen.
