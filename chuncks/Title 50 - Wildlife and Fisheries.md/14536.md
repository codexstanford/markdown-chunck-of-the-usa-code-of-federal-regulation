###### Fishing period limits.,e.g.,

(ii)NMFS will establish fishing period limits,the maximum amount of Pacific halibut that a vessel may retain and land during a specific fishing period, and assign those limits according to vessel class for each fishing period. Fishing period limits may be different across vessel classes (except as described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section). NMFS will determine fishing period limits following the considerations listed in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. The intent of these fishing period limits is to ensure that the Area 2A commercial directed fishery does not exceed the directed commercial allocation, while attempting to provide fair and equitable access across fishery participants to an attainable amount of harvest. The limits will be published in annual management measures rules in thealong with a description of the considerations used to determine them.
