###### "CHANGE".

(10)Each operator must report any "CHANGE" TO the FFV's operations if the position or time of an event specified in an activity report will vary more than 5 nautical miles (9.26 km) or 4 hours from that previously reported, by sending a revised message inserting the word "CHANGE" in front of the previous report, repeating the name, IRCS, date, and time of the previous report, adding the word "TO" and the complete revised text of the new report (action code "CHANGE TO"). Changes to reports specifying an early beginning of fishing by an FFV or other changes to reports contained in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section must be transmitted and delivered as if the "CHANGE" report were the original message.
