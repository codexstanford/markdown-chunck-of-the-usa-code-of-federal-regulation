####### i.e.,

(4) NEFSC must maintain visual monitoring effort during the entire period of time that trawl gear is in the water (throughout gear deployment, fishing, and retrieval). If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully removed from the water, NEFSC must take the most appropriate action to avoid marine mammal interaction. NEFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision;

(5) If trawling operations have been suspended because of the presence of marine mammals, NEFSC may resume only after there are no sightings for 15 minutes within 1nm of sampling location;

(6) If deploying bongo plankton or other small net prior to trawl gear, NEFSC will continue visual observations until trawl gear is ready to be deployed;

(7) NEFSC must implement standard survey protocols to minimize potential for marine mammal interactions. These protocols include, but are not limited to:

(i) Standard tow durations of no more than 30 minutes at target depth for distances less than 3 nautical miles (nm). The exceptions to the 30-minute tow duration are the Atlantic Herring Acoustic Pelagic Trawl Survey and the Deepwater Biodiversity Survey where total time in the water (deployment, fishing, and haul-back) is 40 to 60 minutes and 180 minutes, respectively;

(ii) Trawl tow distances of no more than 3 nm;

(iii) Bottom trawl tows will be made in either straight lines or following depth contours, whereas other tows targeting fish aggregations and deep-water biodiversity tows may be made along oceanographic or bathymetric features;

(iv) Sharp course changes will be avoided in all surveys;

(v) Open the codend of the net close to the deck/sorting area to avoid damage to animals that may be caught in gear; and

(vi) Gear will be emptied as close to the deck/sorting area and as quickly as possible after retrieval; and

(vii) Trawl nets must be cleaned prior to deployment.
