####### What must vicu&#xF1;a range countries do in order to be authorized under the special rule to export to the United States?,Annual Report.

(4)-(i)Range country governments (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru) wishing to export specimens of vicu&#xF1;a to the United States will need to provide an annual report containing the most recent information available on the status of the species, following the information guidelines specified below. The first submission of a status report will be required as of July 1, 2003, and every year thereafter on the anniversary of that date. For each range country, the following information should be provided in the annual report:

(A) A description of any revisions to the management program, especially any changes in management approaches or emphasis;

(B) New information obtained in the last year on vicu&#xF1;a distribution, population status, or population trends, for the country as a whole or for specific protected areas, and a detailed description of the methodology used to obtain such information;

(C) Results of any research projects concluded in the last year on the biology of vicu&#xF1;a in the wild, particularly its population biology, habitat use, and genetics, and a description of any new research projects undertaken on the biology of vicu&#xF1;a in the wild, particularly its population biology, habitat use, and genetics;

(D) A description of any changes to national and/or provincial laws and programs relating to vicu&#xF1;a conservation, in particular those laws and regulations related to harvest and use of the vicu&#xF1;a, and export of vicu&#xF1;a parts and products;

(E) A description of any changes in the number or size of natural reserves or national parks that provide protected habitat for the vicu&#xF1;a;

(F) A summary of law enforcement activities undertaken in the last year, and a description of any changes in programs to prevent poaching, smuggling, and illegal commercialization of the vicu&#xF1;a;

(G) A description of the current management and harvest (or "sustainable use") programs for wild populations of the vicu&#xF1;a, including: any changes in the location and population size of wild populations being managed for sustainable use; any changes in the harvest management practices being used for each population; any changes in current harvest quotas for wild populations, if any; any changes in protocols for translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a summary of the specific financial costs of and revenues generated by the sustainable use program over the last year; and a summary of documented conservation benefits resulting from the sustainable use program over the last year;

(H) A description of current management and harvest (or "sustainable use") programs for captive and so-called "semi-captive" populations of the vicu&#xF1;a, including: any changes in the number and location of all captive and "semi-captive" populations; any changes in the size (ha) of each captive enclosure and the number of vicu&#xF1;a maintained therein; any changes in protocols for translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a summary of the financial costs of and revenues generated by the sustainable use program over the last year; and documented conservation benefits resulting from the sustainable use program over the last year (information on captive and "semi-captive" populations must be separate from that provided for wild populations); and

(I) Export data for the last year.

(ii) The Service's Division of Scientific Authority will conduct a review every 2 years, using information in the annual reports, to determine whether range country management programs are effectively achieving conservation benefits for the vicu&#xF1;a. Failure to submit an annual report could result in a restriction on trade in specimens of vicu&#xF1;a as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section. Based on information contained in the annual reports and any other pertinent information it has available, the Service may restrict trade from a range country, as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, if it determines that the conservation or management status of threatened vicu&#xF1;a populations in a range country has changed, such that continued recovery of the vicu&#xF1;a population in that country may be compromised. Trade restrictions may result from one or more of the following factors:

(A) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens protection for vicu&#xF1;a;

(B) A change in range country management programs that lessens protection for vicu&#xF1;a;

(C) A documented decline in wild vicu&#xF1;a population numbers;

(D) A documented increase in poaching of vicu&#xF1;a;

(E) A documented decline in vicu&#xF1;a habitat quality or quantity; or

(F) Other natural or man-made factors affecting the species' recovery.
