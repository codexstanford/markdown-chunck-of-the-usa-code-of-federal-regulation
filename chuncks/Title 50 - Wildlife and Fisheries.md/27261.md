() For all other groundfish species not specifically listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (b)(1)(ii)(D)() of this section, an amount equal to 10.7 percent of the BSAI TAC will be apportioned to a CDQ reserve if NMFS, after consultation with the Council and in consideration of public comment, determines in the annual harvest specifications process under paragraph (c) of this section that a directed fishery in the BSAI exists for this species under section 305(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. In making this determination, the Council and NMFS shall consider whether sufficient TAC exists to open a directed fishery for that species in the BSAI and that this species or species group is economically viable for the CDQ group to target.
