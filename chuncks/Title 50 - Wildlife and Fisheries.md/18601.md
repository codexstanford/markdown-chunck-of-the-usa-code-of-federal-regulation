(6)If NMFS estimates that recreational landings for a stock, stock complex, or indicator stock have exceeded the applicable recreational ACL specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the stock or stock complex, and the combined commercial and recreational landings for the stock, stock complex, or indicator stock have exceeded the applicable combined commercial and recreational ACL (total ACL) specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for that stock or stock complex, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the length of the recreational fishing season for the stock or stock complex within that fishing year by the amount necessary to prevent recreational landings from exceeding the recreational ACL for the stock or stock complex, unless NMFS determines that a fishing season reduction is not necessary based on the best scientific information available. If NMFS determines that either the recreational ACL or total ACL for the stock or stock complex was exceeded because data collection or monitoring improved rather than because landings increased, NMFS will not reduce the length of the recreational fishing season for the stock or stock complex.
