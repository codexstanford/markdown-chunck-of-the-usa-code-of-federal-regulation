####### Essential features.

(b)The essential features for the conservation of the Arctic subspecies of the ringed seal are:

(1) Snow-covered sea ice habitat suitable for the formation and maintenance of subnivean birth lairs used for sheltering pups during whelping and nursing, which is defined as waters 3 m or more in depth (relative to MLLW) containing areas of seasonal landfast (shorefast) ice or dense, stable pack ice, that have undergone deformation and contain snowdrifts of sufficient depth to form and maintain birth lairs (typically at least 54 cm deep).

(2) Sea ice habitat suitable as a platform for basking and molting, which is defined as areas containing sea ice of 15 percent or more concentration in waters 3 m or more in depth (relative to MLLW).
