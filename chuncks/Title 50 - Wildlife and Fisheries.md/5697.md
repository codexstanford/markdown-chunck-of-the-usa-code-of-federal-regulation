####### Criteria.

(d)The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign certificates. When applying for a U.S. certificate, you must provide sufficient information for us to find that the specimen meets all of the following criteria:

(1) The specimen was removed from the wild or born or propagated in a controlled environment before the date CITES first applied to it, or is a product (including a manufactured item) or derivative made from such specimen.

(2) The scientific name of the species is the standard nomenclature in the CITES Appendices or the references adopted by the CoP (see ยง 23.23).

(3) Live wildlife or plants will be prepared and shipped so as to minimize risk of injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment of the specimen.

(4) For the re-export of a pre-Convention specimen previously imported under a CITES document, the wildlife or plant was legally imported.
