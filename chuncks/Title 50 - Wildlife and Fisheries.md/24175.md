(iv)If two or more permits are combined, the resulting permit is one permit with an increased size endorsement. A C/P-endorsed permit that is combined with another limited entry trawl-endorsed permit that does not have a C/P endorsement will result in a single trawl limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement with a larger size endorsement. Any request to combine permits is subject to the provisions provided at ยง 660.25(b), including the combination formula for resulting size endorsements.
