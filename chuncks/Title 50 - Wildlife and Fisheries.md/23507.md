() For each limited entry trawl permit, NMFS will divide logbook aggregate target species catch in each area (paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section) by the sum of the permit's catch of each target species in all four bycatch areas (paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(H)() of this section) to create a set of area catch ratios for each permit. (Note: The sum of all four area catch ratios in aggregate equals 1 for each permit).
