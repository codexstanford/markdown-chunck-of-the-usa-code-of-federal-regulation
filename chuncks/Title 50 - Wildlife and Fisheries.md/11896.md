(1)The physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the North Atlantic right whale, which provide foraging area functions in Unit 1 are: The physical oceanographic conditions and structures of the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region that combine to distribute and aggregatefor right whale foraging, namely prevailing currents and circulation patterns, bathymetric features (basins, banks, and channels), oceanic fronts, density gradients, and temperature regimes; low flow velocities in Jordan, Wilkinson, and Georges Basins that allow diapausingto aggregate passively below the convective layer so that the copepods are retained in the basins; late stagein dense aggregations in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region; and diapausingin aggregations in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region.
