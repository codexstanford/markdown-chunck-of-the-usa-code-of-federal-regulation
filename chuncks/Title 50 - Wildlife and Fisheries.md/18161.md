###### Recreational sector.

(2)(i) If recreational landings for Atlantic spadefish, as estimated by the SRD, reach or are projected to reach the recreational ACL of 661,926 lb (300,245 kg), round weight, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the recreational sector for the remainder of the fishing year regardless if the stock is overfished, unless NMFS determines that no closure is necessary based on the best scientific information available. On and after the effective date of such a notification, the bag and possession limits for Atlantic spadefish in or from the South Atlantic EEZ are zero.

(ii) If recreational landings for Atlantic spadefish, as estimated by the SRD, exceed the recreational ACL, then during the following fishing year recreational landings will be monitored for a persistence in increased landings, and if necessary, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the length of the recreational fishing season and the recreational ACL by the amount of the recreational ACL overage, if Atlantic spadefish are overfished based on the most recent Status of U.S. Fisheries Report to Congress, and if the combined commercial and recreational ACL of 812,478 lb (368,534 kg), round weight, is exceeded during the same fishing year. NMFS will use the best scientific information available to determine if reducing the length of the recreational fishing season and recreational ACL is necessary. When the recreational sector is closed as a result of NMFS reducing the length of the recreational fishing season and ACL, the bag and possession limits for Atlantic spadefish in or from the South Atlantic EEZ are zero.
