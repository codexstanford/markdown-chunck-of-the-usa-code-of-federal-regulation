####### Will the legal status of grizzly bears in the Experimental Population Area change?

(15)We do not intend to change the "nonessential experimental" designation to "essential experimental," "threatened," or "endangered" and foresee no likely situation that would result in such changes. Critical habitat cannot be designated under the nonessential experimental classification, 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
