()The Council recommendation must specify the recommended duration of the permit. Permit duration may be for any duration from a single fishing season to the duration of section 208 of the AFA. Alternatively, the Council may recommend that the permit be valid as long as the conditions that led to the permit remain in effect. For example, the Council could recommend that a permit issued under this paragraph remain valid as long as the combined annual BSAI pollock TAC remains above 1,274,900 mt. or a lost AFA inshore processor is not reconstructed.
