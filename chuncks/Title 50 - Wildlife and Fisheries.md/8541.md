####### Lease,leasehold interest

means an agreement in which the owner of a fee interest transfers to a lessee the right of exclusive possession and use of an area of land or water for a fixed period, which may be renewable. The lessor cannot readily revoke the lease at his or her discretion. The lessee pays rent periodically or as a single payment. The lessor must be able to regain possession of the lessee's interest () at the end of the lease term. An agreement that does not correspond to this definition is not a lease even if it is labeled as one.
