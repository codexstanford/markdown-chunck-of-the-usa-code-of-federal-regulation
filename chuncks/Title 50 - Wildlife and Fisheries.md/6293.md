###### ยง 29.21-3 Nature of interest granted.

(a) Where the land administered by the Secretary is owned in fee by the United States and the right-of-way is compatible with the objectives of the area, permit or easement may be approved and granted by the Regional Director. Generally an easement or permit will be issued for a term of 50 years or so long as it is used for the purpose granted, or for a lesser term when considered appropriate. For rights-of-way granted under authority of section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, for pipelines for the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid or gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced therefrom, the grant may be for a term not to exceed 30 years and the right-of-way may not exceed 50 feet, plus the area occupied by the pipeline and its related facilities unless the Regional Director finds, and records the reasons for his finding, that, in his judgment, a wider right-of-way is necessary for operation and maintenance after construction, or to protect the environment or public safety. Related facilities include but are not limited to valves, pump stations, supporting structures, bridges, monitoring and communication devices, surge and storage tanks, terminals, etc. However, a temporary permit supplementing a right-of-way may be granted for additional land needed during construction, operation, maintenance, or termination of the pipeline, or to protect the natural environment or public safety.

(b) Unless otherwise provided, no interest granted shall give the grantee any right whatever to remove any material, earth, or stone for construction or other purpose, except that stone or earth necessarily removed from the right-of-way in the construction of a project may be used elsewhere along the same right-of-way in the construction of the same project.
