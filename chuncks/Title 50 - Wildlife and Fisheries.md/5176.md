() At least two letters of reference from people with experience handling and/or flying large raptors such as eagles, ferruginous hawks, goshawks (), or great horned owls (). Each must contain a concise history of the author's experience with large raptors, which can include, but is not limited to, handling of raptors held by zoos, rehabilitating large raptors, or scientific studies involving large raptors. Each letter must also assess your ability to care for eagles and fly them in falconry.

(B) A golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, or Steller's sea-eagle you hold will count as one of the raptors you are allowed to possess for use in falconry.
