#### PART 259 - CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION FUND TAX REGULATIONS
##### ยง 259.4 Constructive deposits and withdrawals; ratification of withdrawals (as qualified) made without first having obtained Secretary's consent; first tax year for which an Agreement is effective.
###### First tax year for which an Agreement is effective.

(c)In order for an Agreement to be effective for any applicant's "Tax Year," the written application must be submitted to the Secretary before the end of the "Filing Period" or "Extension Period" for that tax year, whichever applies. If the written application is received by the Secretary, after the end of the "Filing Period" or "Extension Period," whichever applies, then the Agreement will be first effective for the next succeeding "Tax Year."

(1) It is in the applicant's best interest to submit his or her written application at least 45 days in advance of the end of his or her tax due date. If the written application is submitted too close to the tax due date, and the Secretary is not ultimately able to execute the Agreement, the applicant must bear the burden of negotiating with the Internal Revenue Service for relief. The Secretary shall regard any penalties related to this denied application as due to the applicant's failure to apply for an Agreement in a timely manner.

(2) [Reserved]
