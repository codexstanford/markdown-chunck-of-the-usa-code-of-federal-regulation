######## § 260.103 Operations and operating procedures shall be in accordance with an effective sanitation program.

(a) All operators in the receiving transporting, holdings, segregating, preparing, processing, packaging, and storing of processed products and ingredients, used as aforesaid, shall be strictly in accord with clean and sanitary methods and shall be conducted as rapidly as possible and at temperatures that will inhibit and retard the growth of bacterial and other micro-organisms and prevent any deterioration or contamination of such processed products or ingredients thereof. Mechanical adjustments or practices which may cause contamination of foods by oil, dust, paint, scale, fumes, grinding materials, decomposed food, filth, chemicals, or other foreign materials shall not be conducted during any manufacturing or processing operation.

(b) All processed products, raw materials, ingredients, and components thereof shall be subject to inspection during each manufacturing or processing operation. To assure a safe, wholesome finished product, changes in processing methods and procedures as may be required by the Director shall be effectuated as soon as practicable. All processed products which are not manufactured or prepared in accordance with the requirements contained in §§ 260.96 to 260.104 or are unwholesome or otherwise not fit for human food shall be removed and segregated prior to any further processing operation.

(c) Official establishments operating under Federal inspection should have an effective quality control program as appropriate for the nature of the products and processing operations.

(d) All ingredients used in the manufacture or processing of any processed product shall be wholesome and fit for human food.

(e) The methods and procedures employed in the receiving, segregating, handling, transporting, and processing of ingredients in official estab lishment(s) shall be adequate to result in a satisfactory processed product. Such methods and procedures include, but are not limited to, the following requirements:

(1) Containers, utensils, pans, and buckets used for the storage or transporting of partially processed food ingredients shall not be nested unless rewashed and sanitized before each use;

(2) Containers which are used for holding partially processed food ingredients shall not be stacked in such manner as to permit contamination of the partially processed food ingredients;

(3) Packages or containers for processed products shall be clean when being filled with such products; and all reasonable precautions shall be taken to avoid soiling or contaminating the surface of any package or container liner which is, or will be, in direct contact with such products.

(f) Retention tags: (1) Any equipment such as, but not limited to, conveyors, tillers, sorters, choppers, and containers which fail to meet appropriate and adequate sanitation requirements will be identified by the inspector in an appropriate and conspicuous manner with the word "RETAINED." Following such identification, the equipment shall not be used until the discrepancy has been resolved, the equipment reinspected and approved by the inspector and the "RETAINED" identification removed by the inspector.

(2) Lot(s) of processed products that may be considered to be mislabeled and/or unwholesome by reason of contaminants or which may otherwise be in such condition as to require further evaluation or testing to determine that the product properly labeled and/or wholesome will be identified by the inspector in an appropriate and conspicuous manner with the word "RETAINED." Such lot(s) of product shall be held for reinspection or testing. Final disposition of the lot(s) shall be determined by NMFS and the removal of the "RETAINED" identification shall be performed by the inspector.
