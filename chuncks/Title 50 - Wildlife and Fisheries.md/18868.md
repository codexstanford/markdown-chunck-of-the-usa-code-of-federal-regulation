##### Sea turtle release.

(f)A sea turtle that is actively moving or determined to be dead as described in paragraph B.1.(g) of this appendix must be released. Release the sea turtle when fishing gear is not in use to avoid recapturing the sea turtle. Place the engine gear in neutral position, and then lower the sea turtle into the water from a low part on the vessel, in an area where the sea turtle is unlikely to be recaptured or injured by vessels.
