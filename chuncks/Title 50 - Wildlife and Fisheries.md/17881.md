###### Actions to address genetic issues.

(2)NMFS may sample cultured animals to determine genetic lineage and, upon a determination that genetically engineered or transgenic animals were used or possessed at an aquaculture facility, will order the removal of all cultured animals of the species for which such determination was made. In conducting the genetic testing to determine that all broodstock or progeny of such broodstock will be or were originally harvested from U.S. waters of the Gulf, will be or were from the same population or sub-population that occurs where the facility is located, and that juveniles stocked in offshore aquaculture systems are the progeny of wild broodstock, or other genetic testing necessary to carry out the requirements of the FMP, NMFS may enter into cooperative agreements with States, may delegate the testing authority to any State, or may contract with any non-Federal Government entities. As a condition of the permit, NMFS may also require the permittee to contract a non-Federal Government third party approved by the RA if the RA agrees to accept the third party testing results. The non-Federal Government third party may not be the same entity as the permittee.
