(1) The applicant has been assessed a civil penalty or convicted of any criminal provision of any statute or regulation relating to the activity for which the application is filed, if such assessment or conviction evidences a lack of responsibility.

(2) The applicant has failed to disclose material information required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in connection with his application;

(3) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification for the permit and a showing of responsibility;

(4) The authorization requested potentially threatens a wildlife or plant population, or
