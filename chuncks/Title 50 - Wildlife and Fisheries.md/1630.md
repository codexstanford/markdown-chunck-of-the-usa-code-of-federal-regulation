###### ยง 17.95 Critical habitat - fish and wildlife.
####### i.e.,

(i) Suitable substrates and connected instream habitats, characterized by geomorphically stable stream channels and banks (channels that maintain lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation) with habitats that support a diversity of native aquatic fauna (such as stable riffle-run-pool habitats that provide flow refuges consisting of silt-free gravel, small cobble, coarse sand, and leaf litter substrates) as well as abundant cover and burrows used for nesting.

(ii) Adequate flows, or a hydrologic flow regime (which includes the severity, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time), necessary to maintain instream habitats where the species is found and to maintain connectivity of streams with the floodplain, allowing the exchange of nutrients and sediment for maintenance of the waterdog's habitat, food availability, and ample oxygenated flow for spawning and nesting habitat.

(iii) Water quality (including, but not limited to, conductivity, hardness, turbidity, temperature, pH, ammonia, heavy metals, and chemical constituents) necessary to sustain natural physiological processes for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(iv) Invertebrate and fish prey items, which are typically hellgrammites, crayfish, mayflies, earthworms, snails, beetles, centipedes, slugs, and small fish.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on July 9, 2021.
