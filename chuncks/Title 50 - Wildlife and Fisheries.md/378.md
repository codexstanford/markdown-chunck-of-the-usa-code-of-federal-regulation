####### Requirements for scientifically-based sustainable use management plans.

(a)Sustainable use management plans developed by the country of export should be submitted for species which breed in the country of export. If the species does not breed in the country of export, the Service will consider sustainable use management plans only when the plan is scientifically valid and nesting (breeding) information can be provided from countries in which the species breeds. Sustainable use management plans shall include the following information, and any other information that may be appropriate:

(1) Background information, including the following:

(i) The scientific and common name of the species;

(ii) Letters from the country of export's Management and Scientific Authorities transmitting the management plan of this species;

(iii) A summary of the country of export's legislation related to this species and legislation implementing the Convention, and, where appropriate, a summary of implementing regulations;

(iv) A summary, from the country of export's Management Authority, of the country's infrastructure and law enforcement and monitoring mechanisms designed to ensure both enforcement of and compliance with the requirements of the management plan, and that the number of birds removed from the wild or exported will be consistent with the management plan;

(v) Recent information on the distribution of the species within the country of export, including scientific references and maps, and historical information on distributions, if relevant; and

(vi) The species' status and its current population trend in the country of export, including scientific references and copies of the most recent non-detriment findings made by the exporting country's Scientific Authority.

(2) Habitat information, including:

(i) A general description of habitats used by the species for each portion of the life cycle completed within the country of export;

(ii) Recent information on the size and distribution of these habitats throughout the country of export and in each area or region of take, including scientific references and maps. The approximate location of any reserves that provide protection for this species should be indicated on the accompanying map(s), along with a brief description of how reserves are protected and how that protection is enforced;

(iii) Status and trends of the important habitats used by the species in the country of export as a whole whenever available and within each area or region of take, including scientific references;

(iv) Factors, including management activities, favoring or threatening the species' habitat in the foreseeable future within each area or region of take, and throughout the country of export whenever available, including scientific references; and

(v) A list of management plans that have been or are being planned, developed, or implemented for the species' important habitats, if any.

(3) Information on the role of the species in its ecosystem, including:

(i) A description of the part(s) of the species' life cycle completed within the country of export;

(ii) A description of nest sites and/or plant communities that are most frequently used for placement of nests and, if applicable, nesting habits;

(iii) A general description of the species' diet and where the species forages (aerial feeder, tree canopy, tree trunk, midstory, understory, open water or other), and seasonal changes in foraging habits, including, when available, scientific references; and

(iv) Information on any species or plant community which is dependent on the occurrence of the exotic bird species.

(4) Population dynamics of the species, including:

(i) Recent population data for the population of the species in the country of export, as derived from indices of relative abundance or population estimates, along with documentation for each estimate;
