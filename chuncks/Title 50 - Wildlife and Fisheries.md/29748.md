##### ยง 680.40 Crab Quota Share (QS), Processor QS (PQS), Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ), and Individual Processor Quota (IPQ) Issuance.
###### Harvesting and processing privilege.

(l)QS and PQS allocated or permits issued pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute right to the resource or any interest that is subject to the "takings" provision of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, such QS, PQS, or permits represent only a harvesting or processing privilege that may be revoked or amended pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable law. IPQs do not create a right, title, or interest in any crab until that crab is purchased from a fisherman.
