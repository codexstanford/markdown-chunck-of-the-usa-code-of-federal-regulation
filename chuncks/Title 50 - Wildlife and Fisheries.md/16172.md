(D) As MSY values are estimates or are based on proxies, they will have some level of uncertainty associated with them. The degree of uncertainty in the estimates should be identified, when practicable, through the stock assessment process and peer review (ยง 600.335), and should be taken into account when specifying the ABC Control rule (paragraph (f)(2) of this section).
