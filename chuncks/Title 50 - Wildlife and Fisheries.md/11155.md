####### Seasonal awareness notification messages.

(G)The Navy must issue annual seasonal awareness notification messages to alert Navy ships and aircraft operating within the Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca Mitigation Area to the possible presence of concentrations of Southern Resident killer whales from July 1 to November 30 in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and concentrations of gray whales from March 1 to May 31 in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and northern Puget Sound. For safe navigation and to avoid interactions with large whales, the Navy must instruct vessels to remain vigilant to the presence of Southern Resident killer whales and gray whales that may be vulnerable to vessel strikes or potential impacts from training and testing activities. Platforms must use the information from the awareness notification messages to assist their visual observation of applicable mitigation zones during training and testing activities and to aid in the implementation of procedural mitigation.
