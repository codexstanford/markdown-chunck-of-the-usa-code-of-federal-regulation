### PART 635 - ATLANTIC HIGHLY MIGRATORY SPECIES
#### Subpart B - Individual Vessel Measures
##### ยง 635.15 Individual bluefin tuna quotas (IBQs).
###### Items subject to appeal and adjustment.

(i)A permit holder may appeal their: eligibility for IBQ shares based on ownership of an active vessel with a valid Atlantic Tunas Longline category permit; IBQ share percentage; IBQ allocations; and regional designations of shares and allocations. A permit holder may also appeal NMFS' determination of the number of pelagic longline sets legally made by its permitted vessel. However, an adjustment of GOM shares under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section or inseason quota adjustment under paragraph (e)(3) of this section is not subject to appeal. Appeals based on hardship factors will not be considered. Consistent with most limited effort and catch share programs, hardship is not a valid basis for appeal due to the multitude of potential definitions of hardship and the difficulty and complexity of administering such criteria in a fair manner. NMFS may utilize BFT quota from the Reserve category for any adjustment needed due to an appeal.
