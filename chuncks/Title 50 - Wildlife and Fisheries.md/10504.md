Additionally, if there were any changes to the explosive allowance in a given year, or cumulatively, the report will include a discussion of why the change was made and include analysis to support how the change did or did not affect the analysis in the 2022 PMSR Final Environment Impact Statement/Overseas Environmental Impact Statement ("FEIS/OEIS"; available at) and the analysis in the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) final rule (87 FR [INSERT FR PAGE NUMBER], July 8, 2022).
