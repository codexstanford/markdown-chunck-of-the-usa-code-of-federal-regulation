####### Northeast Region lobster and Jonah crab buoy line markings.,Fisheries.NOAA.gov/ALWTRP;

(i)Beginning May 1, 2022, for all Federal and state Northeast Region lobster and Jonah crab trap/pot gear regulated under this section, the buoy lines must be marked with a solid mark at least 36 inches (91.4 cm) in length within 2 fathoms (3.7 m) of the surface buoy. When fishing in Federal waters, all Northeast Region lobster and Jonah crab trap/pot buoy lines must have an additional green mark of at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length no more than 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the 36-inch (91.4 cm) mark. These long marks within 2 fathoms (3.7 m) of the buoy must be solid marks that may be applied with dyed, painted, or heat-shrink tubing, insertion of a colored rope or braided sleeve, or the line may be marked as approved in writing by the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator. When fishing in state waters, the buoy line below the surface system must be marked by the principal port state color at least two additional times (top half, bottom half) and each mark must at least total 12 inches (30.5 cm) for a total of at least three marks in state waters. For dual permitted vessels, state regulations will determine whether green Federal markings in the surface system and buoy line below the surface system can remain on gear being fished in state waters. When in Federal waters, the buoy line below the surface system must be marked at least three additional times (top, middle, and bottom) with the state or LMA 3 specific color, and each mark must total at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length. An additional green mark of at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length denoting Northeast Region Federal waters must be placed within 6 inches (15.2 cm) of each area-specific colored mark for a total of at least eight marks in Federal waters. In marking or affixing the color code(s) for the 1-foot buoy line marks for gear regulated under this paragraph (b)(2)(i), the line may be: Dyed; painted, marked with thin colored whipping line, thin colored plastic, or heat-shrink tubing; spliced in insertion of a colored rope or braided sleeve or other material, or a thin line may be woven into or through the line; or the line may be marked as approved in writing by the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator. An outreach guide illustrating the techniques for marking gear is available from the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator upon request and posted on the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan website at
