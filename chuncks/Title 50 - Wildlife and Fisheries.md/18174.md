###### Recreational sector.

(2)(i) If recreational landings for red porgy, as estimated by the SRD, exceed the recreational ACL specified in paragraph (v)(2)(ii) of this section, then during the following fishing year, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the length of the recreational fishing season by the amount necessary to ensure recreational landings do not exceed the recreational ACL. However, the length of the recreational fishing season will not be reduced in the following fishing year if NMFS determines, using the best scientific information available, that no fishing season reduction is necessary. When the recreational sector is closed as a result of NMFS reducing the length of the recreational fishing season, the bag and possession limits for red porgy in or from the South Atlantic EEZ are zero.

(ii) The recreational ACL for red porgy is 35,026 lb (15,888 kg), gutted weight, for the 2022 fishing year; 37,829 lb (17,139 kg), gutted weight, for 2023 fishing year; 40,631 lb (18,430 kg), gutted weight, for the 2024 fishing year; 42,499 lb (19,277 kg), gutted weight, for the 2025 fishing year; and 44,367 lb (20,125 kg), gutted weight, for the 2026 and subsequent fishing years.
