(2)If the total ACL specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is exceeded in a fishing year, then during the following fishing year, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the length of the recreational fishing season by the amount necessary to ensure that the recreational ACL is not exceeded during the fishing year following the total ACL overage. However, the recreational fishing season will not be reduced in the following fishing year if NMFS determines, based on the best scientific information available, that the reduction in the recreational fishing season is unnecessary.
