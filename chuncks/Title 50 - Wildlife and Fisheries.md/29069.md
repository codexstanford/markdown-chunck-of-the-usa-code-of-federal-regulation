##### Belt scale

-A scale that employs a conveyor belt in contact with a weighing element to determine the weight of a bulk commodity being conveyed. It is generally a part of a system consisting of an input conveyor, the flow scale, and an output conveyor. The conveyor belt may be constructed of various materials, including vulcanized rubber, canvas, and plastic. The capacity is generally specified in terms of the amount of weight that can be determined in a specified time, and can vary from, for example, 1 ton per hour to 100 or more tons per hour. An operator generally directs the flow of product onto the input conveyor.
