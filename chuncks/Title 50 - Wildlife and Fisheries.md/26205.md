(ix)The transfer of a LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, must be accompanied by the vessel from which the documented harvests were made or its replacement vessel, or if the LLP license and vessel were separated by transfer prior to February 7, 1998, then by the vessel that is currently being deployed by the license holder. The Regional Administrator will deny a transfer application that requests the transfer of a LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, if the appropriate vessel is not being transferred as part of the same transaction. A license holder of an LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, may replace the vessel from which the documented harvests were made with another vessel that meets the vessel designation and MLOA requirements specified on the LLP license if the original qualifying vessel is lost or destroyed.
