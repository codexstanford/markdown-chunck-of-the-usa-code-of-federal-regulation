##### § 679.42 Limitations on use of QS and IFQ.
###### Use of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D by corporations, partnerships, or other non-individual entities.

(j)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(7) of this section, a corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity that received an initial allocation of QS assigned to category B, C, or D may fish the IFQ resulting from that QS and any additional QS acquired within the limitations of this section from a vessel if that corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity:

(i) For a documented vessel, owns a minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel as shown by the U.S. Abstract of Title issued by the U.S. Coast Guard that lists the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity as an owner and, if necessary to prove the required percentage ownership, other written documentation;

(ii) For an undocumented vessel, owns a minimum 20-percent interest in the vessel as shown by a State of Alaska vessel license or registration that lists the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity as an owner and, if necessary to show the required percentage ownership interest, other written documentation; and

(iii) Is represented on the vessel by a hired master employed by that individual and permitted in accordance with § 679.4(d)(2).

(2) The provision of paragraph (j)(1) of this section is not transferable and does not apply to QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory Area 2C or for sablefish in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140&#xB0; W. long. that is transferred to a corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity. Such transfers of additional QS within these areas must be to an individual pursuant to § 679.41(c) and be used pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (i) of this section.

(3) A corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity, except for a publicly held corporation, that receives an initial allocation of QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D loses the exemption provided under this paragraph (j) on the effective date of a change in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity from that which existed at the time of initial allocation.

(4) For purposes of this paragraph (j), "a change" means:

(i) For corporations and partnerships, the addition of any new shareholder(s) or partner(s), except that a court appointed trustee to act on behalf of a shareholder or partner who becomes incapacitated is not a change in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity; or

(ii) For estates, the final or summary distribution of the estate.

(5) The Regional Administrator must be notified of a change in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity as defined in this paragraph (j) within 15 days of the effective date of the change. The effective date of change, for purposes of this paragraph (j), is the date on which the new shareholder(s) or partner(s) may realize any corporate liabilities or benefits of the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity or, for estates, the date of the determination of a legal heir to the estate, or the date of the order for distribution of the estate.

(6) QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D and IFQ resulting from that QS held in the name of a corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity that changes, as defined in this paragraph (j), must be transferred to an individual, as prescribed in § 679.41, before it may be used at any time after the effective date of the change.

(7) A corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity that received an initial allocation of QS assigned to category B, C, or D and that, prior to April 17, 1997, employed a master to fish any of the IFQ issued to that corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity may continue to employ a master to fish its IFQ on a vessel owned by the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity provided that the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity continues to own the vessel at no lesser percentage of ownership interest than that held on April 17, 1997, and provided that corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity did not acquire additional QS through transfer after September 23, 1997.

(8) A corporation, partnership, or other non-individual entity, except for a publicly held corporation, that receives an allocation of QS must provide annual updates to the Regional Administrator identifying all current shareholders, partners, or members to the individual person level and affirming the entity's continuing existence as a corporation or partnership, or other non-individual entity.

(9) The exemption provided in this paragraph (j) may be exercised by a corporation, partnership, association or other non-individual entity on a vessel owned by a person who is a shareholder in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity, provided that the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity maintains a minimum of 20-percent interest in the vessel. For purposes of this paragraph (j), interest in a vessel is determined as the percentage of ownership in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity by that person who is a shareholder in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity, multiplied by the percentage of ownership in the vessel by that person who is a shareholder in the corporation, partnership, association, or other non-individual entity.

(10) Paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(9) of this section do not apply to any QS assigned to vessel category B, C, or D received by transfer after February 12, 2010, by an entity described in paragraph (j)(1) except a hired master may be used to harvest IFQ derived from QS that were consolidated under § 679.41(e)(2) or (e)(3) after February 12, 2010, and before December 1, 2014.
