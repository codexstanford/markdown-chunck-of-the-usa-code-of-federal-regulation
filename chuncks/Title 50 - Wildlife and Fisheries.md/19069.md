###### Vessel monitoring plan.

(1)The vessel owner and/or operator must have available onboard a written VMP for its system. At a minimum, the VMP must include: information on the locations of EM system components (including any customized camera mounting structure); contact information for technical support; instructions on how to conduct a pre-trip system test; instructions on how to verify proper system functions; location(s) on deck where fish retrieval should occur to remain in view of the cameras; specifications and other relevant information regarding the dimensions and grid line intervals for the standardized reference grid; procedures for how to manage EM system hard drives; catch handling procedures; periodic checks of the monitor during the retrieval of gear to verify proper functioning; and reporting procedures. The VMP will be updated, revised, and approved periodically by NMFS or the NMFS-approved contractor, and will include both signature and date indicating when the VMP was approved by NMFS or the NMFS-approved contractor. The VMP should minimize to the extent practicable any impact of the EM systems on the current operating procedures of the vessel, and should help ensure the safety of the crew. The vessel owner and/or operator must implement, and ensure that the vessel complies with, all of the requirements, specifications and protocols outlined in the VMP no later than 6 months after the date of approval of the VMP.
