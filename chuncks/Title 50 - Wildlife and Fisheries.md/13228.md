####### Essential features.,Island-associated marine habitat for main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whales.

(b)The essential feature for the conservation of the main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whale is the following:Main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whales are island-associated whales that rely entirely on the productive submerged habitat of the main Hawaiian Islands to support all of their life-history stages. The following characteristics of this habitat support insular false killer whales' ability to travel, forage, communicate, and move freely around and among the waters surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands:

(1) Adequate space for movement and use within shelf and slope habitat;

(2) Prey species of sufficient quantity, quality, and availability to support individual growth, reproduction, and development, as well as overall population growth;

(3) Waters free of pollutants of a type and amount harmful to main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whales; and

(4) Sound levels that would not significantly impair false killer whales' use or occupancy.
