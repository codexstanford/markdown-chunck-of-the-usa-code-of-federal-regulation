####### i.e.,

(4) NEFSC must maintain visual monitoring effort during the entire period of time that dredge gear is in the water (throughout gear deployment, fishing, and retrieval). If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully removed from the water, NEFSC must take the most appropriate action to avoid marine mammal interaction. NEFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision;

(5) If dredging operations have been suspended because of the presence of marine mammals, NEFSC may resume operations when practicable only when the animals are believed to have departed the area or after 15 minutes of no sightings. NEFSC may use best professional judgment in making this determination; and

(6) NEFSC must carefully empty the dredge gear as close to the deck/sorting area and quickly as possible upon retrieval to determine if marine mammals are present in the gear.
