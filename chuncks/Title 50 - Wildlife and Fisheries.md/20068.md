Prior to commencing the fishing trip following a "declared out of fishery" trip, the owner or authorized representative must notify the Regional Administrator by transmitting the appropriate VMS code, before first crossing the VMS Demarcation Line, that the vessel will be participating in the scallop DAS program, Area Access Program, NGOM Management Program, or LAGC scallop fishery. VMS codes and instructions are available from the Regional Administrator upon request.
