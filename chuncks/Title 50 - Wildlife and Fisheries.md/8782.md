####### Coastal zone.

Coastal zone has the same meaning that the term has in section 304(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 1453(1)). The coastal zone consists of coastal waters (including the lands therein and thereunder) and the adjacent shorelands, including islands, transitional and intertidal areas, salt marshes, wetlands, and beaches. The zone extends, in Great Lakes waters, to the international boundary between the United States and Canada and, in other areas, seaward to the outer limit of the United States territorial sea. The zone extends inland from the shorelines only to the extent necessary to control shorelands and protect coastal waters.
