###### Minor rockfish.

(D)Several rockfish species are designated with species-specific limits on one side of the 40&#xB0;10&#x2032; N. lat. management line, and are included as part of a minor rockfish complex on the other side of the line. A vessel that takes and retains fish from a minor rockfish complex (nearshore, shelf, or slope) on both sides of a management line during a single cumulative limit period is subject to the more restrictive cumulative limit for that minor rockfish complex during that period.
