###### Unit 14: Suwannee Sound in Dixie and Levy Counties, Florida.
####### LOGG-S-2-Gulf of Mexico Sargassum.,Sargassum,et al.

(38)This unit containshabitat only. The northern and western boundaries of the unit follow the 10 m depth contour starting at the mouth of South Pass of the Mississippi River proceeding west and south to the outer boundary of the U.S. EEZ. The southern boundary of the unit is the U.S. EEZ from the 10 m depth contour off of Texas to the Gulf of Mexico-Atlantic border (83&#xB0; W. long.). The eastern boundary follows the 10 m depth contour from the mouth of South Pass of the Mississippi River at 28.97&#xB0; N. lat., 89.15&#xB0; W. long., in a straight line to the northernmost boundary of the Loop Current (28&#xB0; N. lat., 89&#xB0; W. long.) and along the eastern edge of the Loop Current roughly following the velocity of 0.101-0.20 m/second as depicted by Love(2013) using the Gulf of Mexico summer mean sea surface currents from 1993-2011, to the Gulf of Mexico-Atlantic border (24.58&#xB0; N. lat., 83&#xB0; W. long.).
