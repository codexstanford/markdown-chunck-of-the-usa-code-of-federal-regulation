() For purposes of making an initial issuance of whiting QS to a shoreside processor, NMFS will attribute landing history to the Pacific whiting shoreside first receiver reported on the landing receipt (the entity responsible for filling out the state landing receipt) as recorded in the relevant PacFIN dataset on July 1, 2010. History may be reassigned to a shoreside processor not on the state landings receipt as described at paragraph (d)(8)(vi)(B) of this section.
