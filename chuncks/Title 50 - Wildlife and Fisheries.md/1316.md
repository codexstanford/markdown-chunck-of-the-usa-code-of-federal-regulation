() Landowners or their agents conducting invasive or nonnative plant removal use reasonable care, which includes, but is not limited to, procuring and/or implementing technical assistance from a qualified biologist on timing and location of habitat management activities and avoidance of ground disturbance to avoid impacts to larvae or pupae. Best management practices for felling of trees, removal of vegetation off-site, and temporary piling of cut vegetation on-site are available from the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Office.
