###### Notification of IBQ shares and allocations, appeals, and adjustments.

(e)During the last quarter of each year, NMFS will notify Atlantic Tunas Longline permit holders via electronic methods (such as an email) and/or letter to inform them of their IBQ shares, their IBQ allocations, and the regional designations of those shares and allocations for the subsequent fishing year; whether adjustments were made to GOM-designated shares due to the GOM shares cap; and whether the low GOM-designated share threshold has been triggered. This notification represents the initial administrative determination (IAD) for the permit holder's IBQ share and allocation. NMFS will also notify permit holders of any existing quota debt, and provide instructions for appealing the IAD. As of December 31, if an IBQ shareholder does not have a valid Atlantic Tunas Longline category LAP associated with a vessel due to a permit renewal or transfer, NMFS will issue IBQ allocation for the relevant fishing year if/when the permit renewal or transfer is completed and a valid LAP is associated with a vessel. IBQ shares, allocations, and regional designations may change as a result of the following circumstances, in which case NMFS will notify eligible IBQ recipients.
