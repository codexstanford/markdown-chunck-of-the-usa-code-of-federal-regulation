(ii) A vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit may transfer herring at sea to an Atlantic herring carrier up to the applicable possession limits specified in § 648.204, provided it is issued a letter of authorization for the transfer of herring and that no more than the applicable 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) or 40,000 lb (18,143.7 kg) herring possession limit may be caught or transferred at sea per trip or per calendar day if the vessel is in, or the fish were harvested from, an area subject to a possession limit adjustment or fishery closure as specified in § 648.201.
