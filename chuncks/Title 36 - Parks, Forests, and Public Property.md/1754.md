##### ยง 51.82 Are a concessioner's rates required to be reasonable and subject to approval by the Director?

(a) Concession contracts will permit the concessioner to set reasonable and appropriate rates and charges for visitor services provided to the public, subject to approval by the Director.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in a concession contract, the reasonableness of a concessioner's rates and charges to the public will be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and charges for facilities and services of comparable character under similar conditions, with due consideration of the following factors and other factors deemed relevant by the Director: Length of season; peakloads; average percentage of occupancy; accessibility; availability and costs of labor and materials; and types of patronage. Such rates and charges may not exceed the market rates and charges for comparable facilities, goods, and services, after taking these factors into consideration.
