##### Gifts.

(a)It is the policy of the Library of Congress to foster the enrichment of its collections through gifts of materials within the terms of the Library's acquisitions policies. In implementing this policy, division chiefs and other authorized officers of the Library may undertake, as representatives of the Library, preliminary negotiations for gifts to the Library. However, responsibility for formal acceptance of gifts of material and for approval of conditions of such gifts rests with The Librarian of Congress or his designee. The Chief, African/Asian Acquisitions and Overseas Operations Division, Chief, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, and Chief, European and Latin American Acquisitions Division are responsible for routine gifts in the geographic areas covered by their divisions.
