### PART 72 - URBAN PARK AND RECREATION RECOVERY ACT OF 1978
#### Subpart C - Grants for Recovery Action Program Development, Rehabilitation and Innovation
##### ยง 72.45 Fundable elements: Innovation grants.
###### Adaptive reuse.

(2)In addition to providing services for areas or facilities already in recreation use, Innovation grants may provide funding for the adaptive reuse of areas or facilities not currently in recreation use, or those where mixed community use occurs. Physical rehabilitation of facilities not currently in recreation use (whether public or private) may be funded as part of an Innovation proposal, and would be classified as adaptive reuse. An example would be conversion of an abandoned building to a unique community recreation center. When only a portion of the area or facility will be used for recreation, only that portion will be eligible for UPARR funding.
