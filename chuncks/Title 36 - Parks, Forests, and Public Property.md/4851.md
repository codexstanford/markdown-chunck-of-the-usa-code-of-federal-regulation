#### ยง 327.31 Shoreline management fee schedule.

A charge will be made for Shoreline Use Permits to help defray expenses associated with issuance and administration of the permits. As permits become eligible for renewal after July 1, 1976, a charge of $10 for each new permit and a $5 annual fee for inspection of floating facilities will be made. There will be no annual inspection fee for permits for vegetative modification on Shoreline areas. In all cases the total administrative charge will be collected initially at the time of permit issuance rather than on a piecemeal annual basis.
