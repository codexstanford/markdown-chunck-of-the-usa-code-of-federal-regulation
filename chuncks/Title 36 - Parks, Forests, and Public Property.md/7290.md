###### ยง 1206.50 What types of funding and cost sharing arrangements does the Commission make?
####### Cost sharing.

(b)(1) Cost sharing consists of the applicant's contribution to the cost of the project. The Commission ordinarily expects the applicant to provide cost sharing in an amount equal to the amount of the Federal grant award. Exceptions to the one-to-one cost sharing requirement may be set by the Commission in specific grant opportunity announcements.

(2) Cost sharing may include cash or in-kind contributions provided by the applicant or by a non-Federal third party.

(3) As indicated in 2 CFR part 2600, we do not pay indirect costs from grant funds, but allow indirect costs to be used for cost sharing.
