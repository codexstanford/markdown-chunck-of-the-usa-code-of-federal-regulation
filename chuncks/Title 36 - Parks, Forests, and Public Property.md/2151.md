Changes which alter the scope of any approved UPARR competitive grant must be submitted to and approved by NPS. Once a grant offer is made, based upon the preapplication, no increases in the amount of UPARR funding specified in the original proposal will be considered. Such changes should be the basis of a new proposal or application.
