###### Pass-through property and fee limitations.

(b)Rehabilitation or Innovation assistance on property not in public ownership, operated by a private non-profit organization through a pass-through grant, will be limited to that portion of the property which directly provides recreation services. Such recreation services must be available to the public on a non-membership, non-fee, or reasonable fee basis, and during reasonable prime time. If a fee is charged or is required for the services resulting through the Rehabilitation or Innovation grant, the fee should be comparable to prevailing local rates for similar services. Charges for recreation services will only be permitted if they do not unfairly jeopardize participation in the recreation service by the disadvantaged population.
