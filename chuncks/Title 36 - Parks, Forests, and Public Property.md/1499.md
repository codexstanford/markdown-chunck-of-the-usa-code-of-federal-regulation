### PART 17 - CONVEYANCE OF FREEHOLD AND LEASEHOLD INTERESTS ON LANDS OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM
#### ยง 17.3 Lands subject to disposition.

The Act is applicable to any Federally owned real property acquired by the Secretary from non-Federal sources within any unit of the National Park System other than national parks and those national monuments of scientific significance. No leasehold or freehold conveyance shall be made except as to lands which the General Management Plan for the particular unit of the National Park System has designated as a Special Use Zone for the uses that are permitted by the freehold or leasehold conveyance. No leasehold or freehold conveyance shall be made unless the lands have been surveyed for natural, historical, and cultural values and a determination made by the Secretary that such leasehold or freehold conveyance will not be inconsistent with any natural, historical, or cultural values found on the land. Any conveyances affecting properties listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places must be reviewed by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Procedures for obtaining the Council's comments appear at 36 CFR part 800, "Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Resources."
