###### ยง 1234.10 What are the facility requirements for all records storage facilities?
####### i.e.,

(2) Do not install high-voltage electrical distribution equipment (13.2kv or higher switchgear and transformers) within records storage areas (either floor mounted or suspended from roof support structures).

(3) A redundant source of primary electric service such as a second primary service feeder should be provided to ensure continuous, dependable service to the facility especially to the HVAC systems, fire alarm and fire protection systems. Manual switching between sources of service is acceptable.

(4) A facility storing permanent records must be kept under positive air pressure, especially in the area of the loading dock. In addition, to prevent fumes from vehicle exhausts from entering the facility, air intake louvers must not be located in the area of the loading dock, adjacent to parking areas, or in any location where a vehicle engine may be running for any period of time. Loading docks must have an air supply and exhaust system that is separate from the remainder of the facility.
