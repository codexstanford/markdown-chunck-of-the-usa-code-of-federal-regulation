####### Date of decision.

(e)(1) The review official will issue a written decision, based upon either the written record or documentary evidence and information developed at an oral hearing. This decision will be issued as soon as practical, but not later than 60 days after the date on which NARA received your request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings.

(2) If NARA is unable to issue a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the request for a hearing:

(i) NARA may not issue a withholding order or take other action until the hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered; and

(ii) If NARA previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's employer, NARA must suspend the withholding order beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered.
