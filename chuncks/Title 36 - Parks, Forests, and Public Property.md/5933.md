#### ยง 1007.2 Records available.
##### Policy.

(a)It is the policy of the Presidio Trust to make its records available to the public to the greatest extent possible consistent with the purposes of the Presidio Trust Act and the FOIA. The Presidio Trust administers the FOIA with a presumption of openness. As a matter of policy, the Presidio Trust may make discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court.
