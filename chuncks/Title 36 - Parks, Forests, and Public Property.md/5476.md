## Chapter IX - Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation
### PART 902 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
#### Subpart F - Exemptions From Public Access to Corporation Records
##### ยง 902.54 Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

(a) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that are privileged and for which confidentiality is requested by the person possessing such privilege are within the statutory exemption. This includes the following:

(1) Commercial or financial information not customarily released to the public, furnished and accepted in confidence or disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, or both;

(2) Statements of financial interest furnished by officers and employees of the Corporation;

(3) Commercial, technical, and financial information furnished by any person in connection with an application for a loan or a loan guarantee;

(4) Commercial or financial information customarily subjected to an attorney-client or similar evidentiary privilege; or,

(5) Materials in which the Corporation has a property right such as designs, drawings, and other data and reports acquired in connection with any research project, inside or outside of the Corporation, or any grant or contract.

(b) The purpose of this section is to authorize the protection of trade secrets and commercial or financial records that are customarily privileged or are appropriately given to the Corporation in confidence. It assures the confidentiality of trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained by the Corporation through questionnaires and required reports to the extent that the information would not customarily be made public by the person from whom it was obtained. In any case in which the Corporation has obligated itself not to disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information it receives, this section indicates the Corporation's intention to honor that obligation to the extent permitted by law. In addition, this section recognizes that certain materials, such as research data and materials, formulae, designs, and architectural drawings, have significance not as records but as items of property acquired, in many cases at public expense. In any case in which similar proprietary material in private hands would be held in confidence, material covered in this section may be held in confidence.
