(3)Because of the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, automatic document feeders cannot be used for the duplication of paper materials. This adds time and cost to the price of copying these irreplaceable documents.

(b) The NATF costs, at a minimum, include:

(1) Salaries and benefits of the NATF staff involved in all aspects of the records reproduction process (includes, but is not limited to, compensation for full- and part-time employees, temporary appointments, overtime, awards, Civil Service Retirement Service and Federal Employees' Retirement System contributions, health benefits, life insurance benefits and Thrift Savings Plan contributions).

(2) Travel and transportation (includes, but is not limited to, travel and transportation of persons, transportation of things, and contract mail service).

(3) Rent, communications and utilities (includes, but is not limited to, telecommunications, equipment rental, and postage).

(4) Printing and reproductions (includes, but is not limited to, commercial printing, advertising, and printing of forms).

(5) Consulting and other services (includes, but is not limited to, management and professional services, contract labor, work performed in support of reproduction orders, and maintenance of equipment).

(6) Payments to other agencies/funds (includes, but is not limited to, reimbursements and payments to other agencies and other funds within NARA). Specifically, the NATF "hires" the NARA custodial units to do reproduction work. In return, the NATF reimburses the custodial units for the cost of salaries and benefits.
