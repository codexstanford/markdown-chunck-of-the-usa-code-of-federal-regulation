### PART 1010 - ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
#### ยง 1010.7 Actions that do not require an EA or EIS.
##### Extraordinary circumstances.

(b)An action that falls into one or more of the categories in paragraph (a) of this section may still require the preparation of an EIS or an EA if the NEPA Compliance Coordinator determines that it meets the criteria stated in ยง 1010.8(b) or ยง 1010.10(b), respectively, or involves extraordinary circumstances that may have a significant environmental effect. At its discretion, the Trust may require the preparation of an EA or an EIS for a proposal or action that otherwise qualifies for a categorical exclusion. Criteria used in determining whether to prepare an EA or EIS for an action that otherwise qualifies for a categorical exclusion include whether an action may:

(1) Have significant adverse effects on public health or safety;

(2) Have significant adverse effects on such unique geographic characteristics as historic or cultural resources, park, recreation or refuge lands, sole or principal drinking water aquifers, wetlands, floodplains, or ecologically significant or critical areas;

(3) Have highly controversial environmental effects;

(4) Have highly uncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or unknown environmental risks;

(5) Establish a precedent for future action or represent a decision in principle about future actions with potentially significant environmental effects;

(6) Be directly related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant environmental effects;

(7) Have significant adverse effects on properties listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places;

(8) Have significant adverse effects on species listed or proposed to be listed on the List of Endangered or Threatened Species, or have adverse effects on designated Critical Habitat for these species;

(9) Require compliance with Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management), Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands), Executive Order 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites), or the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act; and/or

(10) Threaten to violate a Federal, State, local or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the environment.
