##### ยง 1011.5 What interest, penalty charges and administrative costs will the Presidio Trust add to a debt?
###### Accrual during suspension of debt collection.

(g)In most cases, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). The Presidio Trust may suspend accrual of any or all of these charges when accrual would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Presidio Trust's best interest.
