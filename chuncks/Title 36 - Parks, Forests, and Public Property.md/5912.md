#### § 1004.30 Bicycles.

(a) The use of a bicycle is prohibited except on Presidio Trust roads, in parking areas and on routes designated for bicycle use; provided, however, that the Board may close any Presidio Trust road or parking area to bicycle use pursuant to the criteria and procedures of §§ 1001.5 and 1001.7 of this chapter.
