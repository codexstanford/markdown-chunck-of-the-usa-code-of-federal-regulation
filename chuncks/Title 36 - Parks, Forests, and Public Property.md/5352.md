##### Effect of Memorandum of Agreement.

(3)(i) Agreements duly executed in accordance with these regulations shall constitute the comments of the Council and shall evidence satisfaction of the applicant's responsibilities for the proposed project under section 106 of the Act and these regulations.

(ii) If the Council has commented on an application that is not approved by HUD and a subsequent UDAG application is made for the same project, the project need not be referred to the Council again unless there is a significant amendment to the project which would alter the effect of the project on previously considered properties or result in effects on additional National Register properties or properties which meet the Criteria.

(iii) Failure to carry out the terms of a Memorandum of Agreement requires that the applicant again request the Council's comments in accordance with these regulations. In such instances, until the Council issues its comments under these regulations the applicant shall not take or sanction any action or make any irreversible or irretrievable commitment that could result in an adverse effect with respect to National Register properties or properties which are eligible for inclusion in the National Register covered by the Agreement or that would foreclose the Council's consideration of modifications or alternatives to the proposed project that could avoid or mitigate the adverse effect.
