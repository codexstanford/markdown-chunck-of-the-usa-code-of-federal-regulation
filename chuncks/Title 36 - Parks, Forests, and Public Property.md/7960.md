###### ยง 1238.14 What are the microfilming requirements for permanent and unscheduled records?
####### Background density of images.

(2)Agencies must use the background ISO standard visual diffuse transmission density on microforms appropriate to the type of documents being filmed. Agencies must use the procedure for density measurement described in ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 1238.5). The densitometer must meet with ANSI/NAPM IT2.18 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 1238.5) for spectral conditions and ANSI/NAPM IT2.19 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 1238.5) for geometric conditions for transmission density.

(i) Recommended visual diffuse transmission background densities for images of documents are as follows:

(ii) Recommended visual diffuse transmission densities for computer generated images are as follows:
