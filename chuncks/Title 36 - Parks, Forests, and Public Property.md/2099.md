###### Recovery Action Program Grant Matching.

(a)Up to 50 percent matching grants are authorized for the preparation of Recovery Action Programs (RAP). State, local and private in-kind donations of assistance (salaries, supplies, printing, etc.) for the preparation of a RAP may be used as all or part of the 50 percent local match. Such in-kind contributions for the UPARR Program may not be used as the matching share for other federally-assisted programs. In addition, Section 1009 of the Act provides that reasonable local costs of Recovery Action Program development may be used as part of a local match for Innovation or Rehabilitation grants only when the applicant has not received a Recovery Action Program grant. Reasonable costs means costs for supplies, salaries, etc., which are not excessive in relation to the normal market value within a geographic area. These costs must be well documented and included in the preapplication for the proposal in which they are to be used as a match. The match can only be used once, and allowed only after the RAP Has been approved by the respective NPS Regional Office.
