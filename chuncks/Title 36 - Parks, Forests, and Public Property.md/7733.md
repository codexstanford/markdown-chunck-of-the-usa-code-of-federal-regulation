#### PART 1232 - TRANSFER OF RECORDS TO RECORDS STORAGE FACILITIES
##### ยง 1232.14 What requirements must an agency meet before it transfers records to a records storage facility?

An agency must meet the following requirements before it transfers records to a records storage facility:

(a) Ensure that the requirements of 36 CFR part 1234 are met. Special attention must be paid to ensuring appropriate storage conditions for records on non-paper based media (e.g., film, audio tape, magnetic tape), especially those that are scheduled for long-term or permanent retention, as those records typically require more stringent environmental controls (see 36 CFR parts 1236 and 1237).
