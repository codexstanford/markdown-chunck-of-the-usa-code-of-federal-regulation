###### How made and addressed.

(a)You may make a request for records of the Foundation by writing to the General Counsel, Morris K. Udall Foundation, 110 South Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, Arizona 85701-1650. If you are making a request for records about yourself, see ยง 1600.21 for additional requirements. If you are making a request for records about another individual, either a written authorization signed by that individual permitting disclosure of those records to you or proof that that individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary) will help the processing of your request. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope "Freedom of Information Act Request."
