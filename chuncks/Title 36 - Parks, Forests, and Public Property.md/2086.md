###### Strategies to Address National and Local Concerns.

(b)This section should include a description of local strategies for recreation system recovery. A "strategy" defines the total approach to remedying system deficiencies and provides a rationale for priorities reflected in implementation schedules. Strategies should be devised which address the following national concerns:

(1) Ways in which park and recreation plans contribute to, and will be interrelated with, the local government's community development and urban revitalization efforts;

(2) The degree to which park and recreation plans serve citizens who reside in economically-distressed areas of the community and will improve access to park and recreation facilities and programs for minority groups, low- and moderate-income populations, and the handicapped;

(3) The extent to which the Action Program and its plan component will relate employment opportunities for minorities, youth and low- and moderate-income residents;

(4) How the plan seeks to obtain the widest range of beneficial uses of the natural environment and enhances and protects the natural environment;

(5) How park and recreation resources will be targeted in neighborhoods where other neighborhood revitalization efforts are occurring;

(6) How the plan seeks to restore outstanding or unique structures, landscapes, or similar features in parks of historical or architectural significance;

(7) Local commitments to innovative and cost-effective programs and projects on the neighborhood level which augment recovery of park and recreation systems;

(8) How the plan will be intergrated with other Federally assisted projects to maximize recreation opportunities;

(9) How the plan will convert for recreation use, derelict and other public lands not designated for recreation; and

(10) Inducements to encourage the private sector to provide neighborhood park and recreation facilities and programs.

(11) How the plan will seek to preserve, restore and develop waterfront areas for recreation and open space.
