### PART 1010 - ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
#### ยง 1010.10 Actions that normally require an EA.
##### General procedure.

(a)If a proposal or action is not one that normally requires an EIS, and does not qualify for a categorical exclusion under ยง 1010.7, the Trust will require, prepare, or direct the preparation of an EA. An EA should be prepared when the Trust has insufficient information on which to determine whether a proposal may have significant impacts. An EA assists the Trust in complying with NEPA when no EIS is necessary, and it facilitates the preparation of an EIS, if one is necessary.
