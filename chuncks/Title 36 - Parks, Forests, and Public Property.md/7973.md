###### ยง 1238.32 Do agencies need to request NARA approval for the disposition of all microform and source records?
####### Temporary records.

(b)Agencies do not need to obtain additional NARA approval when destroying scheduled temporary records that have been microfilmed. The same approved retention period for temporary records is applied to microform copies of these records. The original records can be destroyed once microfilm is verified, unless legal or other requirements prevent their early destruction.
