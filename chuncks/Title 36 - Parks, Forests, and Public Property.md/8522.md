###### Appeals of adverse determinations.

(a)If you are dissatisfied with the Foundation's response to your request, you may appeal an adverse determination denying your request, in any respect, to the Executive Director of the Foundation, 110 S. Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, AZ 85701-1650. You must make your appeal in writing, and it must be received by the Executive Director within 60 days of the date of the letter denying your request. Your appeal letter may include as much or as little related information as you wish, as long as it clearly identifies the determination (including the assigned request number, if known) that you are appealing. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark your appeal letter and the envelope "Freedom of Information Act Appeal."
