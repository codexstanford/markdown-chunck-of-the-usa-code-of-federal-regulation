## Chapter X - Presidio Trust
### PART 1007 - REQUESTS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
#### ยง 1007.3 Requests for records.
##### e.g.,

(iii) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Presidio Trust may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

(iv) Requesters are advised that, under ยง 1007.9 (f), (g) and (h), the time for responding to requests may be delayed:

(A) If a requester has not sufficiently identified the fee category applicable to the request;

(B) If a requester has not stated a willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated by the Presidio Trust; or

(C) If a fee waiver request is denied and the requester has not included an alternative statement of willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated by the Presidio Trust.

(4) A request seeking a fee waiver shall, to the extent possible, address why the requester believes that the criteria for fee waivers set out in ยง 1007.10 are met.

(5) To facilitate handling, both the envelope containing a request and the face of the request should bear the legend "FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST."
