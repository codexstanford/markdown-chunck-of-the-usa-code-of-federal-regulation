###### ยง 223.53 Urgent removal contract extensions.
####### Regional Forester determination.

(b)If the Regional Forester determines that adequate cause for urgent removal extensions exists, Contracting Officers may extend National Forest System timber sale contracts, up to a maximum of 1 year, for the estimated amount of time required to harvest and process the damaged timber on non-National Forest System lands. Contracting Officers may grant urgent removal extensions only when the Regional Forester verifies in writing that:

(1) A specific catastrophe occurred for which urgent removal extensions should be granted;

(2) The manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to purchasers are insufficient to provide for both the rapid harvest of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and the continued harvest of undamaged (green) timber under contract with the Forest Service; and

(3) Failure to harvest the damaged non-National Forest System timber promptly could result in the following:

(i) Pose a threat to public safety,

(ii) Create a threat of an insect or disease epidemic to National Forest System or other lands or resources, or

(iii) Significant private or other public resource loss.
