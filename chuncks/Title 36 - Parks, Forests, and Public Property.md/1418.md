###### Use of bait for taking bears.

(d)(1) The superintendent may issue individual, annual permits allowing the use of human-produced food items as bait for taking bears upon a finding that:

(i) Such use is compatible with the purposes and values for which the area was established (e.g. does not create a user conflict); and

(ii) The permit applicant does not have reasonable access to natural bait that may be used under ยง 13.480(b)(1).

(2) Permits will identify specific locations within the park area where the bait station may be established and will not include areas where the use of such materials could create a user conflict.
