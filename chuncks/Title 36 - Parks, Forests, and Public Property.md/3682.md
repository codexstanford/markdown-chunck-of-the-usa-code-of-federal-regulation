###### Harvest limits.

(f)(1) The harvest limit specified for a trapping season for a species and the harvest limit set for a hunting season for the same species are separate and distinct. This means that if you have taken a harvest limit for a particular species under a trapping season, you may take additional animals under the harvest limit specified for a hunting season or vice versa.

(2) A brown/grizzly bear taken in a Unit or portion of a Unit having a harvest limit of "one brown/grizzly bear per year" counts against a "one brown/grizzly bear every four regulatory years" harvest limit in other Units. You may not take more than one brown/grizzly bear in a regulatory year.
