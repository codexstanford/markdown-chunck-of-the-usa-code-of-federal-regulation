####### Presidential libraries and museums.

(c)(1) You should contact the Presidential library and museum where you wish to hold your event (see contact information in 36 CFR 1253.3).

(2) Depending on what kind of event you want to host, you may be referred to the foundation that supports the library to make the event arrangements and to pay any event fees and costs that apply. Some Presidential libraries are located at shared-use facilities where their library foundations own certain areas and spaces used for private group events and operate those areas and spaces under their rules rather than the rules in this part 1280.
