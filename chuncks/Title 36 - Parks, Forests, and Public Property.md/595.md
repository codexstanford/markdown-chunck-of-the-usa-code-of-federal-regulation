(2) That the investigation proposed will not jeopardize the preservation of park resources;

(3) That the study undertaken will have demonstrable value to the National Park Service in its management or understanding of park resources; and

(b) Hiking is permitted only on trails designated for that purpose by the Superintendent by the posting of appropriate signs or by marking on a map which shall be available for inspection by the public at park headquarters and other convenient locations within the park. Persons hiking on the Pictograph Point or Spruce Canyon Trails must register in advance with the Superintendent.
