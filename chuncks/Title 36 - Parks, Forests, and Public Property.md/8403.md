####### ยง 1280.4 Children under the age of 14.
######## e.g.,

We admit children under the age of 14 to NARA facilities only if they are accompanied by an adult who will supervise them at all times. The director of a NARA facility may authorize a lower age limit for unaccompanied children to meet special circumstances (students who have been given permission to conduct research without adult supervision).
