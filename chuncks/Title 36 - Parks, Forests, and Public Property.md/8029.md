####### Search cut-off date.

(c)As the end or cut-off date for a records search, NARA uses the date on which we first begin our search for documents responsive to your request, unless you specify an earlier cut-off date. This includes those cases when you request records "through the present," "through today," or similar language. If NARA uses any other search end date, we inform you of that date.
