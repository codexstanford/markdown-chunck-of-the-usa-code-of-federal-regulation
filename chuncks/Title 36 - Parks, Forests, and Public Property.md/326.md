##### Commercial passenger-carrying vehicles.

(f)The prohibition against the commercial transportation of passengers by motor vehicles in Yellowstone National Park contained in ยง 5.4 of this chapter shall be subject to the following exception: Motor vehicles operated on an infrequent and nonscheduled tour on which the visit to the park is an incident to such tour, carrying only round trip passengers traveling from the point of origin of the tour will, subject to the conditions set forth in this paragraph, be accorded admission to the park for the purpose of delivering passengers to a point of overnight stay in the park and exit from the park. After passengers have completed their stay, such motor vehicles shall leave the park by the most convenient exit station, considering their destinations. Motor vehicles admitted to the park under this paragraph shall not, while in the park, engage in general sightseeing operations. Admission will be accorded such vehicles upon establishing to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the tour originated from such place and in such manner as not to provide in effect a regular and duplicating service conflicting with, or in competition with, the services provided for the public pursuant to contract authorization from the Secretary. The superintendent shall have the authority to specify the route to be followed by such vehicles within the park.
