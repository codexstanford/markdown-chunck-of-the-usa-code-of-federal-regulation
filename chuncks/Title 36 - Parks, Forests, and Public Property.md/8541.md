###### Limitations on charging fees.

(d)(1) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.

(2) Review fees will be charged only for commercial use requests.

(3) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

(4) Except for commercial use requests, the Foundation will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time to requesters without charge. These provisions work together, so that the Foundation will not begin to assess fees until after providing the free search and reproduction. For example, if a request involves three hours of search time and duplication of 105 pages of documents, the Foundation will charge only for the cost of one hour of search time and five pages of reproduction.

(5) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (d) of this section is $14.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
