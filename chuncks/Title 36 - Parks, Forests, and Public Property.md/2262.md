#### Subpart E - Disposition of Particular Material Remains
##### ยง 79.12 Determining which particular material remains are eligible for disposal.
###### Overly redundant and not useful for research.

(iii)Material remains are overly redundant and not useful for research in light of the collection's archeological context, research questions, and research potential. These considerations may vary based on geography, time and culture period, scientific or cultural significance, prior analysis, and other factors. Because it is difficult to predict if future analytical methods will yield useful information about the material remains proposed for disposal, a sample of the material remains deemed to be overly redundant and not useful for research must be retained for curation, as required by ยง 79.15(f).
