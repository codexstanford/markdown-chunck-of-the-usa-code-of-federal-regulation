###### ยง 1250.26 How does NARA process my FOIA request?
####### Complex processing queue factors.

(g)We place into a complex processing queue any request that cannot be completed within 20 working days due to complexity, volume, because it contains national security information, because it involves Presidential or Vice Presidential records, or involves unusual circumstances. Unusual circumstances include the need to:

(1) Search for and collect the records from one or more field facilities;

(2) Search for, collect, and review a voluminous amount of records that are part of a single request;

(3) Consult with another Federal agency before releasing records; or

(4) Refer records to another Federal agency for declassification.
