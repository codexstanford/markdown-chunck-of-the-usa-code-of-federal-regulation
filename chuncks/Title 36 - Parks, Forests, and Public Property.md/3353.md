####### Leasing analyses.

(c)The leasing analysis shall be conducted by the authorized Forest officer in accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR part 219 (Forest land and resource management planning) and/or, as appropriate, through preparation of NEPA documents. As part of the analysis, the authorized Forest officer shall:

(1) Identify on maps those areas that will be:

(i) Open to development subject to the terms and conditions of the standard oil and gas lease form (including an explanation of the typical standards and objectives to be enforced under the standard lease terms);

(ii) Open to development but subject to constraints that will require the use of lease stipulations such as those prohibiting surface use on areas larger than 40 acres or such other standards as may be developed in the plan for stipulation use (with discussion as to why the constraints are necessary and justifiable); and

(iii) Closed to leasing, distinguishing between those areas that are being closed through exercise of management direction, and those closed by law, regulation, etc.

(2) Identify alternatives to the areas listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including that of not allowing leasing.

(3) Project the type/amount of post-leasing activity that is reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of conducting a leasing program consistent with that described in the proposal and for each alternative.

(4) Analyze the reasonable foreseeable impacts of post-leasing activity projected under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
