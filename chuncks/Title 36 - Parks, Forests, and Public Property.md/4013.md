###### Reductions in monitoring fees for certain category 6 authorizations.

(ii)For category 6 authorizations issued under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, the holder:

(A) May request a reduction of the monitoring fee based upon the holder's written analysis of actual costs, the monetary value of the rights or privileges granted, that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest, the public service provided, the efficiency of the agency monitoring involved, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs. The agency will determine whether the estimate of full actual costs should be reduced based upon this analysis and will notify the holder in writing of this determination; or

(B) May agree in writing to waive payment of reasonable costs and pay the actual costs incurred in monitoring the authorization.
