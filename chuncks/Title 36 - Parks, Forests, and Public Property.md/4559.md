(a)The standards and guidelines of this section apply to timber harvesting activities in the Other Lands category of the HCNRA.

(1) Timber may be harvested only to protect and enhance ecosystem health, wildlife habitat, or recreational and scenic uses; to reduce the risk of harm posed by hazard trees; or to respond to natural events such as wildfire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, high winds, and disease or insect infestation.

(2) Where authorized, trees may be harvested by selective cuttings. Openings created by the timber harvesting activity must be limited in size and number to the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the harvest, and must blend with the natural landscape to the extent practicable.
