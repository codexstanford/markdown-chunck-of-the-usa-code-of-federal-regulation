(b)(1) A route in Middle Smithfield Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania, bounded by the Delaware River on the east and Hidden Lake on the west. The route begins at the Smithfield Beach parking area and is in two loops. Loop One is a small trail approximately 3 miles long and follows the west bank of the Delaware River and closely parallels the east side of L. R. 45012 (commonly known as the River Road). Loop Two is approximately 6 miles long and begins at the northwest end of Loop One; it goes northeasterly between the Delaware River and River Road for about one mile until it crosses River Road; then southwesterly along the ridge which is south of Hidden Lake to a point opposite the west end of Hidden Lake, and then goes southeasterly until it returns to Loop One near River Road. Maps of the route are available at Smithfield Beach and at the office of the superintendent. Both loops are marked by appropriate signs.
