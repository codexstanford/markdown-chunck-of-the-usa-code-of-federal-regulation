###### commercial use request

(1) Ais a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will determine the use to which the requester will put the records sought. Where the Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Corporation will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
