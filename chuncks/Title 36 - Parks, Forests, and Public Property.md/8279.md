##### ยง 1258.6 How does NARA calculate fees for individual products?
###### Actual cost percent calculation.

(c)Using the information calculated in the Cost Summary, the actual revenue cost percentage is determined. In some cases, the actual percentage of cost can be calculated from available data or known constraints of the product line. For example, if the contractor responsible for providing copy support does not support the reproduction of a given product line then zero (0) percent of the contractor's costs would be allocated to that product line.
