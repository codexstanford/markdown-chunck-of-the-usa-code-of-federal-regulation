###### ยง 1201.17 What must I do to obtain a review of my debt, and how will the review process work?
####### Request for review.,see

(a)(1) You have the right to request a review by NARA of the existence or amount of your debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable. If you want a review, you must send a written request to the NARA official designated in the notice (ยง 1201.16(d)).

(2) You must sign your request for review and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses that support your position. Your request for review should be accompanied by available evidence to support your contentions.

(3) Your request for review must be received by the designated officer or employee of NARA on or before the 60th calendar day following the date of the notice. Timely filing will stay the commencement of collection procedures. NARA may consider requests filed after the 60-day period provided for in this section if you:

(i) Can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond your control; or

(ii) Did not receive notice of the filing deadline (unless you had actual notice of the filing deadline).
