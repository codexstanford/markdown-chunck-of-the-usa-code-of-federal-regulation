###### Ski area permits.

(2)(i) For authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, the authorized officer normally shall issue a ski area authorization for 40 years, if, upon consideration of information submitted by the applicant, the authorized officer finds that the ski area development meets the following standards:

(A) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing on-site investment is of sufficient magnitude to justify authorization for 40 years;

(B) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing investment of capital is in ski-related facilities;

(C) Planned investment capital is directly related to development of ski area facilities and is not for financing regular, ongoing operation and maintenance costs;

(D) Ski facilities requiring long-term investment are, or will be, located predominately on land authorized under a permit;

(E) The number and magnitude of planned facilities, as detailed in a Master Development Plan, clearly require long-term financing and/or operation;

(F) The United States is not the owner of the principal facilities within the authorized ski area.

(ii) A term of less than 40 years shall be authorized for a ski area when the applicant requests a shorter term or when, in the authorized officer's discretion:

(A) Analysis of the information submitted by the applicant indicates that a shorter term is sufficient for financing of the ski area;

(B) The ski area development, whether existing or proposed, does not meet the standards of paragraph (2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section; or

(C) A 40-year authorization would be inconsistent with the approved forest land and resource management plan governing the area (36 CFR part 219).
