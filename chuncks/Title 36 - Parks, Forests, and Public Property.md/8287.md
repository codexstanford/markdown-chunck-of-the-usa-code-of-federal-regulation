##### ยง 1258.10 How does NARA develop and publicize new records reproduction fees?

(a) Custodial units prepare a justification proposal for a proposed records reproduction service and send the justification to the custodial unit office head, through appropriate channels, for concurrence and forwarding to NATF. The justification proposal includes, at a minimum, the following information:

(1) Estimated monthly volume of product orders based on available historical data;

(2) Identification of the equipment and supplies required to provide the product and service;

(3) Brief description of the process required to provide the product and service, including the amount of time for each number and grade level of staff.

(4) Identification of any services or products that will be replaced by the proposed products and services;

(5) Identification of other NARA units that may have a demand for the proposed services; and

(6) Any other relevant information.

(b) After receiving the proposal, NATF staff:

(1) Assesses the potential customer base for the proposed products and services, consulting other NARA offices.

(2) If the potential demand does not warrant establishing fees for new records reproduction products and services, NATF notifies the proposing office that the new product and service are not approved and the reasons why.

(3) If the potential demand warrants, NATF prepares a cost analysis following the methodology in ยง 1258.6 and develops a proposed recommended fee for review by NARA's Financial Resources Division and approval by the Archivist of the United States.
