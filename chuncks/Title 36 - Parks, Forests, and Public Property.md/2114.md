(1) The general category of sites/facilities or programs involved must be an identified priority in the jurisdiction's Recovery Action Program.

(2) The results of the expansion must not substantially increase the personnel or maintenance costs of the applicant jurisdiction's overall recreation system unless expansion of the system has been addressed as a priority in the jurisdiction's Recovery Action Program, and the RAP strategies specifying how the funds for increased personnel or maintenance costs associated with the expansion will be obtained. The preapplication narrative must describe the extent of increased personnel and maintenance for the project(s) included in the proposal, if any, and methods of financing them.

(3) The expansion must increase the extent, volume, scope, or quality of recreation opportunities to residents of distressed neighborhoods.
