##### How must a tribe request to enter into an agreement?

(c)(1) A tribal official must submit to the Superintendent a written request to enter into an agreement under this section that contains the following:

(i) A description of the Indian tribe's traditional association to the park area;

(ii) A description of the traditional purposes to which the traditional gathering activities will relate; and

(iii) A description of the traditional gathering and removal activities that the tribe is interested in conducting, including a list of the plants or plant parts that tribal members wish to gather and the methods by which those plants or plant parts will be gathered.

(2) Within 90 days after receiving a request that contains the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Superintendent will initiate consultation with the requesting tribe in order to develop an agreement. If a Superintendent fails to initiate consultation within 90 days after receiving such a request, then the tribe may submit the request to the Regional Director. The Superintendent will also consult with any other tribe that has gathering rights in that park area under a treaty or federal statute or is party to a valid plant-gathering agreement with the NPS for that park area.
