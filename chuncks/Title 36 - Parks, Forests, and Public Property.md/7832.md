###### ยง 1235.32 How does NARA handle restrictions on transferred records?
####### For records more than 30 years old.

(b)(1) After records are more than 30 years old, most statutory and other restrictions on transferred records expire. NARA, however, after consulting with the transferring agency, may keep the restrictions in force for a longer period.

(2) See part 1256 of this chapter for restrictions on specific categories of records, including national security classified information and information that would invade the privacy of an individual that NARA restricts beyond 30 years.
