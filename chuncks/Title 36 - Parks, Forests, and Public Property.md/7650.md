###### Identification.

(a)Federal agencies request authority to dispose of records, either immediately or on a recurring basis. Requests for immediate disposal are limited to existing records that no longer accumulate. For recurring records, approved schedules provide continuing authority to destroy the records. The retention periods approved by NARA are mandatory, and the agency must dispose of the records after expiration of the retention period, except as provided in §§ 1226.18 and 1226.20 of this subchapter.
