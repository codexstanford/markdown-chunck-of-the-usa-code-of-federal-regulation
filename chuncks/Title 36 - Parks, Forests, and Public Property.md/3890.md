###### Minimum vegetation clearance distance

-the calculated distance (stated in feet or meters) that is used to prevent flashover between conductors and vegetation for various altitudes and operating voltages. The MVCD is measured from a conductor's maximum operating sag to vegetation on NFS lands within the linear right-of-way for a powerline facility and on NFS lands adjacent to either side of the linear right-of-way for a powerline facility for purposes of felling or pruning hazard trees, which the owner or operator uses to determine whether vegetation poses a system reliability hazard to the powerline facility.
