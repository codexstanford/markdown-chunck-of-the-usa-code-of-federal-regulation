### PART 2 - RESOURCE PROTECTION, PUBLIC USE AND RECREATION
#### ยง 2.51 Demonstrations and designated available park areas.
##### Permits and the small group permit exception.

(b)Demonstrations are allowed within park areas designated as available under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, when the superintendent has issued a permit for the activity, except that:

(1) Demonstrations involving 25 persons or fewer may be held without a permit within designated park areas, provided that:

(i) None of the reasons for denying a permit that are set out in paragraph (f) of this section are present;

(ii) The group is not merely an extension of another group already availing itself of the small group permit exception under this provision;

(iii) They will not unreasonably interfere with other permitted demonstrations and special events, or park program activities; and

(iv) Hand-carried signs may be used, but stages, platforms, or structures may not be used.

(2) While it is not mandatory, the organizer is requested to provide reasonable notice of the proposed event to the park superintendent, including whether there is any reason to believe that there may be an attempt to disrupt, protest, or prevent the activity.

(3) The 25-person maximum for the small group permit exception may be reduced for a designated available area, but only if:

(i) A written determination that a 25-person group cannot be reasonably physically accommodated within that area is approved by the regional director; and

(ii) The written determination is made available at the office of the superintendent and by public notice under ยง 1.7 of this chapter.

(4) In the event that two or more groups taking advantage of the small group permit exception seek to use the same designated available area at the same time, and the area cannot reasonably accommodate multiple occupancy, the superintendent will, whenever possible, direct the later-arriving group to relocate to another nearby designated available area.
