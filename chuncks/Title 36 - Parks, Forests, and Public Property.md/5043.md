## Chapter VII - Library of Congress
### PART 701 - PROCEDURES AND SERVICES
#### ยง 701.2 Acquisition of Library material by non-purchase means.
##### Deposits.

(b)(1) The Anglo-American Acquisitions Division is the only division in the Library authorized to make technical arrangements, formally negotiate for the transportation of materials and conditions of use at the Library, and prepare written Agreements of Deposit to formalize these negotiations. The term "deposit" is used to mean materials which are placed in the custody of the Library for general use on its premises, but which remain the property of their owners during the time of deposit and until such time as title in them may pass to the Library of Congress. A deposit becomes the permanent property of the Library when title to it is conveyed by gift or bequest. A deposit may be withdrawn by the owner rather than conveyed to the Library. A deposit shall be accompanied by a signed Agreement of Deposit.

(2) It is the policy of the Library of Congress to accept certain individual items or special collections as deposits when: permanent acquisition of such materials cannot be effected immediately; the depositors give reasonable assurance of their intention to donate the materials deposited to the United States of America for the benefit of the Library of Congress; the Library of Congress determines that such ultimate transfer of title will enrich its collections; and the depositors agree that the materials so deposited may be available for unrestricted use or use in the Library under reasonable restrictions.
