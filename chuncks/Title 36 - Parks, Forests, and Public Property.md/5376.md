##### Overview Study:

a.This level of study is normally conducted as a part of general planning and is useful at an early stage in project formulation. It is designed to obtain a general understanding of an area's historic and cultural properties in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, by:

(1) Assessing the extent to which the area has been previously subjected to study;

(2) Locating properties previously recorded;

(3) Assessing the probability that properties eligible for the National Register will be found if the area is closely inspected, and

(4) Determining the need, if any, for further investigation.
