###### Reduction in processing fees for certain category 6 applications.

(ii)For category 6 applications submitted under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, the applicant:

(A) May request a reduction of the processing fee based upon the applicant's written analysis of actual costs, the monetary value of the rights and privileges sought, that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest, the public service provided, the efficiency of the agency processing involved, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs. The agency will determine whether the estimate of full actual costs should be reduced based upon this analysis and will notify the applicant in writing of this determination; or

(B) May agree in writing to waive payment of reasonable costs and pay the actual costs incurred in processing the application.
