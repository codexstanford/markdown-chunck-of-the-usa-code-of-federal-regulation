###### ยง 1201.18 What interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs will I have to pay on a debt owed to NARA?
####### Waiver.

(f)(1) The Archivist may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs, if he or she determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of NARA.

(2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, and unless otherwise stated in these regulations, where these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Archivist's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges is final and is not subject to further review.
