(1)(i) Stores, restaurants, garages, service stations, and comparable business enterprises will be situated in centers zoned for this purpose unless they are operated as part of a resort or hotel. Commercial centers will be of sufficient size that expansion of facilities or service areas is not dependent upon use of public land.

(ii) Sites outside designated commercial centers will be used for resort development contingent upon case by case concurrence of the responsible county officials and the Secretary that such use is, in all aspects, compatible with the purposes for establishing the recreation area.

(iii) Structures for commercial purposes, inclusive of isolated resorts or motels, will not exceed two stories height at front elevation, and will be conventional architecture and will utilize colors, nonglare roofing materials, and spacing or layout that harmonizes with forested settings. Except for signs, structures designed primarily for purposes of calling attention to products or service will not be permitted.
