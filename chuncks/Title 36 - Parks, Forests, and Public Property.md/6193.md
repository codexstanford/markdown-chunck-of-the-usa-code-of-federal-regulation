## Chapter X - Presidio Trust
### PART 1011 - DEBT COLLECTION
#### Subpart C - Procedures for Offset of Presidio Trust Payments To Collect Debts Owed To Other Federal Agencies
##### ยง 1011.21 How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by the Presidio Trust?
###### Offset of Presidio Trust payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.

(a)(1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by other Federal agencies, a process known as "centralized offset." When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask the Presidio Trust (when acting as a paying agency) to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Presidio Trust, including salary payments issued to the Presidio Trust employees. This section and ยง 1011.22 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks the Presidio Trust to offset a payment issued by the Presidio Trust to a person who owes a debt to the United States.

(2) This subpart C does not apply to the collection of debts through tax refund offset.
