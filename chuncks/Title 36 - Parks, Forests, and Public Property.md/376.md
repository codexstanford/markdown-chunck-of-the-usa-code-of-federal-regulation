##### Backcountry camping.

(a)For purposes of clarification at Shenandoah National Park, "backcountry camping" is defined as any use of portable shelter or sleeping equipment in the backcountry. "Backcountry" is defined as those areas of the park which are more than 250 yards from a paved road, and more than one-half mile from any park facilities other than trails, unpaved roads and trail shelters. The Superintendent may designate areas where backcountry camping is prohibited if there would be potential damage to park resources or disruption to other park uses. Such areas will be marked on maps available in the Superintendent's office, visitor centers and ranger stations. A person or group of persons may camp overnight at any other backcountry location within the park, except:

(1) No person or group of persons traveling together may camp without a valid backcountry camping permit. The issuance of this permit may be denied when such action is necessary to protect park resources or park visitors, or to regulate levels of visitor use in legislatively-designated wilderness areas;

(2) No person may camp in or with a group of more than nine (9) other persons;

(3) No person or group may backcountry camp:

(i) Within 250 yards or in view from any paved park road or the park boundary;

(ii) Within one-half mile or in view from any automobile campground, lodge, restaurant, visitor center, picnic area, ranger station, administrative or maintenance area, or other park development or facility except a trail, an unpaved road or a trail shelter;

(iii) On or in view from any trail or unpaved road, or within sight of any sign which has been posted by park authorities to designate a no camping area;
