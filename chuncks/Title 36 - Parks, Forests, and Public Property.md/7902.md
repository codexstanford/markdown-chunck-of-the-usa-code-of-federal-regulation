###### ยง 1236.36 Disposing of original source records.

(a) When an agency has validated that the digitized versions meet the standards in ยง 1236.32, the agency may destroy the original source records pursuant to General Records Schedule (GRS) 5.2 (intermediary records) or an agency-specific records schedule that addresses disposition after digitization, subject to any pending legal constraint on the agency, such as a litigation hold.
