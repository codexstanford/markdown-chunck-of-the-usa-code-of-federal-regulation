###### ยง 228.113 Notice of noncompliance.
####### Extension of deadlines.

(2)The operator may request an extension of a deadline specified in a notice of noncompliance if the operator is unable to come into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance by the deadline because of conditions beyond the operator's control. The authorized Forest officer shall not extend a deadline specified in a notice of noncompliance unless the operator requested an extension and the authorized Forest officer finds that there was a condition beyond the operator's control, that such condition prevented the operator from complying with the notice of noncompliance by the specified deadline, and that the extension will not adversely affect the interests of the United States. Conditions which may be beyond the operator's control include, but are not limited to, closure of an area in accordance with 36 CFR part 261, subparts B or C, or inaccessibility of an area of operations due to such conditions as fire, flooding, or snowpack.
