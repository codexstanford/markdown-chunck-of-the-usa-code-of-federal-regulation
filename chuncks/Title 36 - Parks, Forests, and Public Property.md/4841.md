##### Periodic Review.

(7)Shoreline Management Plans will be reviewed periodically, but no less often than every five years, by the district commander to determine the need for update. If sufficient controversy or demand exists, consideration should be given, consistent with other factors, to a process of reevaluation of the shoreline allocations and the plan. When changes to the Shoreline Management Plan are needed, the plan will be formally updated through the public participation process. Cumulative environmental impacts of permit actions and the possibility of preparing or revising project NEPA documentation will be considered. District commanders may make minor revisions to the Shoreline Management Plan when the revisions are consistent with policy and funds for a complete plan update are not available. The amount and type of public involvement needed for such revision is at the discretion of the district commander.
