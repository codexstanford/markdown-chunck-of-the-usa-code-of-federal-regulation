#### ยง 62.8 Natural landmark designation removal.
##### Criteria for removal.

(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, national natural landmark designation is removed from an area:

(i) When it can be shown that an error in professional judgment was made such that the site did not meet the criteria for national significance at the time of designation;

(ii) When the values which originally qualified it for designation have been lost or destroyed; or

(iii) When applicable designation procedures were not followed because of prejudicial failure.

(2) Any affected owner of a designated national natural landmark may initiate the removal by submitting to the Director a request for removal of designation, stating the grounds for this removal and specifying the error in professional judgment, loss of natural values or prejudicial procedural error. A prejudicial procedural error is one that reasonably may be considered to have affected the outcome of the designation process.

(3) Within 60 days of receiving a removal request, the NPS notifies the party submitting the request of whether the NPS considers the documentation sufficient to consider removal of the natural landmark designation.
