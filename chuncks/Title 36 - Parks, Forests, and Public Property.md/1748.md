#### Subpart I - Concession Contract Provisions
##### ยง 51.76 May the Director include in a concession contract or otherwise grant a concessioner a preferential right to provide new or additional visitor services?

The Director may not include a provision in a concession contract or otherwise grant a concessioner a preferential right to provide new or additional visitor services under the terms of a concession contract or otherwise. For the purpose of this section, a "preferential right to new or additional services" means a right of a concessioner to a preference (in the nature of a right of first refusal or otherwise) to provide new or additional visitor services in a park area beyond those already provided by the concessioner under the terms of a concession contract. A concession contract may be amended to authorize the concessioner to provide minor additional visitor services that are a reasonable extension of the existing services. A concessioner that is allocated park area entrance, user days or similar resource use allocations for the purposes of a concession contract will not obtain any contractual or other rights to continuation of a particular allocation level pursuant to the terms of a concession contract or otherwise. Such allocations will be made, withdrawn and/or adjusted by the Director from time to time in furtherance of the purposes of this part.
