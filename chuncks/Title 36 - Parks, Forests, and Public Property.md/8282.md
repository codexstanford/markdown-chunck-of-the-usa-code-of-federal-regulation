##### ยง 1258.6 How does NARA calculate fees for individual products?
###### Additional cost allocation.

(f)The costs unique to a given product line. Each product line is evaluated to determine the costs that are unique to that product line, such as purchase and installation costs of specialty equipment, replacement costs for aging equipment, copier leases and maintenance costs, etc. These costs are then allocated against those product lines that use the equipment. Where costs cross product lines, the allocations are apportioned based upon the percent of the estimated copy volume for each product line.
