(c)(1) You may take salmon only under the authority of a subsistence fishing permit, unless a permit is specifically not required in a particular area by the subsistence regulations in this part, or unless you are retaining salmon from your commercial catch consistent with paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) If a subsistence fishing permit is required by this section, the following permit conditions apply unless otherwise specified in this section:

(i) You may not take more fish for subsistence use than the limits set out in the permit;

(ii) You must obtain the permit prior to fishing;

(iii) You must have the permit in your possession and readily available for inspection while fishing or transporting subsistence-taken fish;

(iv) If specified on the permit, you must record, prior to leaving the fishing site, daily records of the catch, showing the number of fish taken by species, location and date of catch, and other such information as may be required for management or conservation purposes; and

(v) If the return of catch information necessary for management and conservation purposes is required by a fishing permit and you fail to comply with such reporting requirements, you are ineligible to receive a subsistence permit for that activity during the following calendar year, unless you demonstrate that failure to report was due to loss in the mail, accident, sickness, or other unavoidable circumstances. You must also return any tags or transmitters that have been attached to fish for management and conservation purposes.
