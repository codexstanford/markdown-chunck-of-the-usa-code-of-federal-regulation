####### Types of grants.,Matching grant.

(a)(1)A matching grant is a Federal grant awarded only after the applicant raises its share of non-Federal support for a project. We will match only funds raised from non-Federal sources, either monies provided by the applicant's own institution specifically for the project or from a non-Federal third-party source. The Commission does not ordinarily make matching grants.
