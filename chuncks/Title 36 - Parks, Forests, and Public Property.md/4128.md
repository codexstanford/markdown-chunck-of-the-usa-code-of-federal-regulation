(2)If Federal lands proposed for exchange are occupied under grant, permit, easement, or non-mineral lease by a third party who is not a party to the exchange, the third party holder of such authorization and the non-Federal party to the exchange may reach agreement as to the disposition of the existing use(s) authorized under the terms of the grant, permit, easement, or lease. The non-Federal exchange party shall submit documented proof of such agreement prior to issuance of a decision to approve the land exchange, as instructed by the authorized officer. If an agreement cannot be reached, the authorized officer shall consider other alternatives to accommodate the authorized use or shall determine whether there are specific and compelling reasons in the public interest for revoking the authorization for that use pursuant to 36 CFR 251.60.
