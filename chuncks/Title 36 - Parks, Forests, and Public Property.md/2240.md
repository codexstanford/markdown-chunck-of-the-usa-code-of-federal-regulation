###### Guidelines for selecting a repository.

(b)(1) When possible, the collection should be deposited in a repository that:

(i) Is in the State of origin;

(ii) Stores and maintains other collections from the same site or project location; or

(iii) Houses collections from a similar geographic region or cultural area.

(2) The collection should not be subdivided and stored at more than a single repository unless such subdivision is necessary to meet special storage, conservation or research needs.

(3) Except when non-federally-owned material remains are retained and disposed of by the owner, material remains and associated records should be deposited in the same repository to maintain the integrity and research value of the collection.
