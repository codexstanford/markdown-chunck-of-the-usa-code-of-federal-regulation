An applicant, by accepting a right-of-way, agrees and consents to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions, excepting those which the Secretary may waive in a particular case:

(a) To comply with State and Federal laws applicable to the project for which the right-of-way is approved, and to the lands which are included in the right-of-way, and lawful existing regulations thereunder.

(b) To clear and keep clear the lands within the right-of-way to the extent and in the manner directed by the superintendent; and to dispose of all vegetative and other material cut, uprooted, or otherwise accumulated during the construction and maintenance of the project in such manner as to decrease the fire hazard and also in accordance with such instructions as the superintendent may specify.

(c) To take such soil and resource conservation and protection measures including weed control, on the land covered by the right-of-way as the superintendent may request.

(d) To do everything reasonably within his power, both independently and on request of any duly authorized representative of the United States, to prevent and suppress fires on or near the lands to be occupied under the right-of-way, including making available such construction and maintenance forces as may be reasonably obtainable for the suppression of such fires.

(e) To build and repair such roads, fences, and trails as may be destroyed or injured by construction work and to build and maintain necessary and suitable crossings for all roads and trails that intersect the works constructed, maintained, or operated under the right-of-way.

(f) To pay the United States the full value for all damages to the lands or other property of the United States caused by him or by his employees, contractors, or employees of the contractors, and to indemnify the United States against any liability for damages to life, person or property arising from the occupancy or use of the lands under the right-of-way; except that where a right-of-way is granted hereunder to a state or other governmental agency whose power to assume liability by agreement is limited by law, such agency shall indemnify the United States as provided above to the extent that it may legally do so.

(g) To notify promptly the superintendent of the amount of merchantable timber, if any, which will be cut, removed, or destroyed in the construction and maintenance of the project, and to pay the United States through such superintendent in advance of construction such sum of money as such superintendent may determine to be the full stumpage value of the timber to be so cut, removed, or destroyed.

(h) To comply with such other specified conditions, within the scope of the applicable statute and lawful regulations thereunder, with respect to the occupancy and use of the lands as may be found by the National Park Service to be necessary as a condition to the approval of the right-of-way in order to render its use compatible with the public interest.

(i) That upon revocation or termination of the right-of-way, unless the requirement is waived in writing, he shall, so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, restore the land to its original condition to the entire satisfaction of the superintendent.

(j) That he shall at all times keep the authorized officer informed of his address, and, in case of corporations, of the address of its principal place of business and of the names and addresses of its principal officers.

(k) That in the construction, operation, and maintenance of the project, he shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin and shall require an identical provision to be included in all subcontracts.

(l) That the allowance of the right-of-way shall be subject to the express condition that the exercise thereof will not unduly interfere with the management and administration by the United States of the lands affected thereby, and that he agrees and consents to the occupancy and use by the United States, its grantees, permittees, or lessees of any part of the right-of-way not actually occupied or required by the project, or the full and safe utilization thereof, for necessary operations incident to such management, administration, or disposal.

(m) That the right-of-way herein granted shall be subject to the express covenant that it will be modified, adapted, or discontinued if found by the Secretary to be necessary, without liability or expense to the United States, so as not to conflict with the use and occupancy of the land for any authorized works which may be hereafter constructed thereon under the authority of the United States.
