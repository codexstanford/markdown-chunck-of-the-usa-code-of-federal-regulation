##### ยง 51.73 What is the term of a concession contract?

A concession contract will generally be awarded for a term of 10 years or less unless the Director determines that the contract terms and conditions, including the required construction of capital improvements, warrant a longer term. It is the policy of the Director under these requirements that the term of concession contracts should be as short as is prudent, taking into account the financial requirements of the concession contract, resource protection and visitor needs, and other factors the Director may deem appropriate. In no event will a concession contract have a term of more than 20 years (unless extended in accordance with this part).
