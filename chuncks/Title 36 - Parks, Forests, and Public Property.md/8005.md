####### Presidential Records Act

(p)(PRA) means the law that, in part, governs access to Presidential and Vice Presidential records and is codified at 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207 and Part 1270 of these regulations. The PRA contains six restrictions that authorize NARA to withhold information, which apply for 12 years after a President leaves office. Four of the PRA restrictions are identical to FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Two relate to appointments to Federal office and confidential communications requesting or submitting advice between the President and his advisers, or between and among such advisers. The PRA also excludes application of FOIA Exemption 5.
