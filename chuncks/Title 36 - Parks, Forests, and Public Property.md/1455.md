###### Evidence of water right.

(b)If the project involves the storage, diversion, or conveyance of water, the applicant must file a statement of the proper State official, or other evidence, showing that he has a right to the use of the water. Where the State official requires an applicant to obtain a right-of-way as a prerequisite to the issuance of evidence of a water right, if all else be regular, a right-of-way may be granted conditioned only upon the applicant's filing the required evidence of water right from the State official within specified reasonable time. The conditional right-of-way will terminate at the expiration of the time allowed.
