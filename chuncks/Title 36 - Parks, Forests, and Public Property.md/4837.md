(ii)Public Recreation Areas are those areas designated for commercial concessionaire facilities, Federal, state or other similar public use. No private shoreline use facilities and/or activities will be permitted within or near designated or developed public recreation areas. The term "near" depends on the terrain, road system, and other local conditions, so actual distances must be established on a case by case basis in each project Shoreline Management Plan. No modification of land forms or vegetation by private individuals or groups of individuals is permitted in public recreation areas.
