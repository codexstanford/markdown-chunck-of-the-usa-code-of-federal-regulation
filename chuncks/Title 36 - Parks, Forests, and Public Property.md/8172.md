####### ยง 1254.22 Do I need to register when I visit a NARA facility for research?

(a) Yes, you must register each day you enter a NARA research facility by furnishing the information on the registration sheet or scanning an encoded researcher identification card. We may ask you for additional personal identification.

(b) NARA facilities in the Washington, DC, area contain several research rooms; you must register in each research room you visit on a daily basis.

(c) In regional archives, you also sign out when leaving the research room for the day. In some Presidential libraries, where we instruct you to do so, you sign out when you leave the building.
