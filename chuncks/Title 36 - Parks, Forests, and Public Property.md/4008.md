(6)(i) Processing fees in minor categories 1 through 4 are nonrefundable and shall not be reconciled.

(iii) For category 6 cases, if payment of the processing fee exceeds the full actual costs of processing an application submitted under the Mineral Leasing Act, or the full reasonable costs (when the applicant has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of processing an application submitted under other authorities, the authorized officer either shall refund the excess payment to the applicant or, at the applicant's request, shall credit it towards monitoring fees due.

(iv) For major category 5 and category 6 applications, an applicant whose application is denied or withdrawn in writing is responsible for costs incurred by the Forest Service in processing the application up to and including the date the agency denies the application or receives written notice of the applicant's withdrawal. When an applicant withdraws a major category 5 or category 6 application, the applicant also is responsible for any costs subsequently incurred by the Forest Service in terminating consideration of the application.
