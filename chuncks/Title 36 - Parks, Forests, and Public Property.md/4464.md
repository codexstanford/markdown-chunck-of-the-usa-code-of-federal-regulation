(c)The following standards apply to properties in all land use categories.

(1) Use and development of the property will be in conformance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations and ordinances.

(2) Development, improvement and use of the property will not materially detract from the scenic, natural, historic, pastoral, and fish and wildlife values of the area.

(3) There will be adequate provision for disposal of solid and liquid waste originating on or resulting from use of the property.

(4) All new utilities will be underground.

(5) No structures or other improvements will be constructed in or encroaching upon streambeds, banks and flood plains of live or intermittent streams. Streambeds, banks, and flood plains will not be disturbed, except as may be necessary to construct, operate, and maintain irrigation, fisheries, utilities, roads, and similar facilities or improvements. Any such necessary encroachment will avoid impeding water flow, sedimentation of streams or entrance of deleterious material into streams.
