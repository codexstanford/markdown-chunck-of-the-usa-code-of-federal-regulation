###### Advance payments.

(12)The Corporation will not require a requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request unless:

(i) The Corporation estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250; or

(ii) If a requester has previously failed to make timely payments (i.e., within 30 days of billing date) of fees charged under this part, the requester may be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest accrued thereon or demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Corporation begins to process a new request or a pending request from this requester.

(iii) With regard to any request coming within paragraphs (b)(12) (i) and (ii) of this section, the administrative time limits set forth in §§ 902.60, 902.61, and 902.62 of this part will begin to run only after the Corporation has received the requisite fee payments.
