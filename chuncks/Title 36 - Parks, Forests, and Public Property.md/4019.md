###### Category 5: Master agreements.

(v)The Forest Service and the holder of an authorization may enter into a master agreement for the agency to recover monitoring costs associated with a particular authorization or by a group of authorizations for a specified geographic area. This category is minor if 50 hours or less are needed for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with an authorization and major if more than 50 hours are needed. In signing a master agreement for a major category authorization issued under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, a holder waives the right to request a reduction of the monitoring fee based upon the reasonableness factors enumerated in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. A master agreement shall at a minimum include:

(A) The fee category or estimated monitoring costs;

(B) A description of the method for periodic billing, payment, and auditing of monitoring fees;

(C) A description of the geographic area covered by the agreement;

(D) A monitoring work plan and provisions for updating the work plan;

(E) Provisions for reconciling differences between estimated and final monitoring costs; and

(F) Provisions for terminating the agreement.
