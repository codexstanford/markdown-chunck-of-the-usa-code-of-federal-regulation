###### Forest Service directives.

(10)To enhance the reliability of the electric grid and to reduce the threat of wildfire damage to, and wildfire caused by vegetation-related conditions within or on, powerline facility rights-of-way and by hazard trees on abutting National Forest System lands, the Forest Service shall issue and periodically update directives in its directive system (36 CFR 200.4) to ensure that provisions are appropriately developed and implemented for powerline facility vegetation management, powerline facility inspection, and operation and maintenance of powerline facility rights-of-way. The directives shall:

(i) Be developed in consultation with owners;

(ii) Be compatible with mandatory reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization;

(iii) Consider all applicable law, including fire safety and electrical system reliability requirements, such as reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization;

(iv) Consider the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding on Vegetation Management for Powerline Rights-of-Way Among the Edison Electric Institute, Utility Arborist Association, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and any successor memorandum of understanding;

(v) Seek to minimize the need for case-by-case approvals for routine vegetation management (including hazard tree felling and pruning), powerline facility inspection, and operation and maintenance of powerline facilities; and

(vi) Provide for prompt and timely review of requests to conduct routine vegetation management.
