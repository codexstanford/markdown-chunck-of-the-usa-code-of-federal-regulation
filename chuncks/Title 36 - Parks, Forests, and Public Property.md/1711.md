#### Subpart G - Leasehold Surrender Interest
##### ยง 51.51 What special terms must I know to understand leasehold surrender interest?
###### Fixtures and non-removable equipment

are manufactured items of personal property of independent form and utility necessary for the basic functioning of a structure that are affixed to and considered to be part of the structure such that title is with the Director as real property once installed. Fixtures and non-removable equipment do not include building materials (e.g., wallboard, flooring, concrete, cinder blocks, steel beams, studs, window frames, windows, rafters, roofing, framing, siding, lumber, insulation, wallpaper, paint, etc.). Because of their special circumstances, floating docks (but not other types of floating property) constructed by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a leasehold surrender interest concession contract are considered to be non-removable equipment for leasehold surrender interest purposes only. Except as otherwise indicated in this part, the term "fixture" as used in this part includes the term "non-removable equipment."
