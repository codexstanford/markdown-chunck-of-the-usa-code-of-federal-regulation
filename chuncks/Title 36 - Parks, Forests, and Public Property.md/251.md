### PART 6 - SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL SITES IN UNITS OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM
#### ยง 6.5 Solid waste disposal sites in operation on September 1, 1984.
##### Site expansions.

(e)(1) A request for an existing solid waste disposal site to continue operations by expanding its capacity, laterally or vertically, is considered a request for a new solid waste disposal site and is subject to the conditions of ยง 6.4(a), except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(2) A request for an existing solid waste disposal site to continue operations by expanding its capacity, laterally or vertically, will be judged by the approval conditions of paragraph (c) of this section if the operator shows that:

(i) The solid waste is generated solely from sources within the boundaries of the unit;

(ii) The area proposed for site expansion encompasses only nonfederal lands owned or leased by the operator; and

(iii) the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail, or adequate water access to any lands outside the unit for all or substantial portions of the year.

(f) After January 23, 1995, an operator of an NPS-approved existing landfill solid waste disposal site may convert that site to a transfer station only after submitting a request under paragraph (a) of this section, and only after receiving approval from the Regional Director under paragraph (c) of this section. The Regional Director may approve such a request, if in addition to meeting the standards of paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Director finds that the conversion to a transfer station better protects the unit's natural or cultural resources than the existing land-fill operation.
