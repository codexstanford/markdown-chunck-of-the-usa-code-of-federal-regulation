####### Supplemental environmental impact statements.

(k)Departmental officials shall supplement a draft EIS whenever an alternative which is substantially different from those discussed in the draft is under consideration or when the draft is otherwise out of date. A final EIS shall be supplemented when a substantial change is made in the proposed action or when significant new information on the environmental impacts comes to light. A supplemental EIS should be prepared, circulated and approved in accordance with the provisions of ยง 1502.9 of the CEQ Regulations. No supplemental EIS need be prepared when the final decision on the action in question has already been made. If there are reasons not to prepare a supplemental EIS when one ordinarily would be called for, the responsible action officer should consult with the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues , which shall consult with the Council on Environmental Quality on the matter.
