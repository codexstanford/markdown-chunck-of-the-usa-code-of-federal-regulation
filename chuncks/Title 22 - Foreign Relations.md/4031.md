###### When notice to business submitters is required.

(c)(1) The component's FOIA office shall promptly provide written notice to a business submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the component's FOIA office determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the business submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

(ii) The component's FOIA office has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.

(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.
