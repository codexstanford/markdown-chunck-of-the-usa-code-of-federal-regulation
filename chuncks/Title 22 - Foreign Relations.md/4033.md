###### Opportunity to object to disclosure.

(e)(1) The component's FOIA office shall specify a reasonable time period within which the business submitter must respond to the notice referenced in paragraph (c) of this section. If a business submitter has any objections to disclosure, the business submitter should:

(i) Provide the component's FOIA office with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the business submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

(ii) [Reserved].

(2) A business submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the component's FOIA office after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the component's FOIA office. Any information provided by a business submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
