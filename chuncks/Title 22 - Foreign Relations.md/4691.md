### PART 228 - RULES FOR PROCUREMENT OF COMMODITIES AND SERVICES FINANCED BY USAID
#### Subpart A - Definitions and Scope of This Part
##### ยง 228.01 Definitions.
###### Available for purchase

means for commodities, that the commodity is offered for sale in a country in the authorized principal geographic code at the time of purchase from the supplier, irrespective of the place of manufacture or production, unless it is a prohibited source country. If applicable, the commodity must also be able to be serviced, and, if warrantied, have a valid warranty. For services, available for purchase means the service is offered from a vendor which has complied with nationality and foreign government-owned organization requirements of this regulation, and is otherwise organized in a country in the authorized principal geographic code designated in an implementing instrument. This definition does not apply to procurements under the geographic Code 935, see ยง 228.03, because that geographic code is for any country or area except for prohibited source countries.
