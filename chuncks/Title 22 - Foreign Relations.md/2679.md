###### Enforcement of discovery rights.

(d)If the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls fails to provide the respondent with information in its possession which is not otherwise available and which is necessary to the respondent's defense, the Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the charges on her or his own motion or on a motion of the respondent. If the respondent fails to respond with reasonable diligence to the requests for discovery by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls or the Administrative Law Judge, on her or his own motion or motion of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and upon such notice to the respondent as the Administrative Law Judge may direct, may strike respondent's answer and declare the respondent in default, or make any other ruling which the Administrative Law Judge deems necessary and just under the circumstances. If a third party fails to respond to the request for information, the Administrative Law Judge shall consider whether the evidence sought is necessary to a fair hearing, and if it is so necessary that a fair hearing may not be held without it, the Administrative Law Judge shall determine whether substitute information is adequate to protect the rights of the respondent. If the Administrative Law Judge decides that a fair hearing may be held with the substitute information, then the proceedings may continue. If not, then the Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the charges.
