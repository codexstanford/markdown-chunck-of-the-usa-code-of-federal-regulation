####### Emergency expenditure authorization.

(c)Since an immediate need for a short-term full diet program often prohibits the delay inherent in contacting the Department and receiving authority to expend funds, the consular officer can expend up to an amount to be established by the Department without prior Departmental approval if the prisoner's case meets the criteria established in paragraph (a) of this section. Expenditures above the predetermined limit must receive the prior approval of the Department.
