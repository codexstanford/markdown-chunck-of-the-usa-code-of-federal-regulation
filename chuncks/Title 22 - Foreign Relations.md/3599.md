###### i.e.

(ii) When price alone would not be an effective means of determining an award (, when criteria, such as time of delivery or service capability need to be evaluated);

(iii) When emergency procurement is justified by a demonstration that the time required for formal competitive bid procedures would result in an unacceptable delay in delivering the commodities;

(iv) When proprietary procurement is justified; or

(v) When adherence to formal competitive procedures would impair program objectives.

(2) When formal competitive bidding procedures have failed, all bids have been rejected, and further use of such procedures would clearly not be productive, the Mission Director may authorize the use of competitive negotiation procedures. Further advertising is not required. The request for quotations may be prepared as a new document or may incorporate appropriate provisions of the invitation for bids. It shall be submitted to those potential suppliers who originally submitted bids in response to the invitation for bids.
