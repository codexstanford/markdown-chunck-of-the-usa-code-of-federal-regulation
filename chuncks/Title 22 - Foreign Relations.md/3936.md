#### ยง 211.5 Obligations of cooperating sponsor.
##### Use of funds.

(k)(1) Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors and recipient agencies may use monetized proceeds and program income to:

(i) Transport, store, distribute and otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the use of donated commodities and products thereof, including construction or improvement of storage facilities or warehouses, handling, insect and rodent control, payment of personnel employed or used by the cooperating sponsor or recipient agencies in support of approved programs;

(ii) Implement income generating, community development, health, nutrition, cooperative development, agricultural and other developmental activities agreed upon by A.I.D. and the cooperating sponsor;

(iii) Make investments, with the approval of A.I.D., and any interest earned on such investments may be used for purposes described in paragraphs (k)(l) (i) and (ii) of this section;

(iv) Improve their financial and other management systems; and

(v) Pay indirect costs of the cooperating sponsor that are allocable to the monetization program at the indirect cost rate approved by A.I.D. for the cooperating sponsor, the direct and indirect costs of an office maintained by the cooperating sponsor in the country where the monetization program is conducted that are allocable to the title II program there, and the costs of a regional office maintained by a cooperating sponsor that are allocable to the cooperating sponsor's effort to enhance the effectiveness of the use of commodities provided by A.I.D. under title II.

(2) Monetized proceeds and program income may be used by the cooperating sponsor and recipient agencies only for the purposes described in the Operational Plan or TA, or otherwise approved by A.I.D., in writing, and only for such costs as would be allowable under OMB Circular A-122, as amended, "Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations". A recipient agency may use not to exceed $500 per year of voluntary contributions for institutional, community or social development or other humanitarian purposes without regard to the Operational Plan or TA or OMB Circular A-122.

(3) Governmental cooperating sponsors shall use monetized proceeds and program income only for emergency purposes as described in the TA with respect to such programs.

(4) Monetized proceeds and program income may not be used to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.

(5) Except as A.I.D. may otherwise agree in writing, monetized proceeds may not be used to finance the production for export of agricultural commodities, or products thereof, that would compete in the world market with similar agricultural commodities, or products thereof, produced in the United States, if such competition would cause substantial injury to the United States producers, as determined by A.I.D.

(6)(i) The cooperating sponsor shall use commercially reasonable practices in construction activities and in purchasing goods and services with monetized proceeds or program income; maintain a code of standards of conduct regarding conflicts of interest; carry out procurement transactions in a manner to provide open and free competition to the maximum extent practicable; and maintain and make available to A.I.D. in accordance with ยง 211.10 records and documents regarding the procurement of goods and services with monetized proceeds and program income. Cooperating sponsors shall follow their own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds and payment bonds when program income or monetized proceeds are used to finance construction or the improvement of facilities, but shall consult with USAID or the Diplomatic Post regarding such requirements when the estimated cost of such construction or improvements exceeds $100,000. Title to real and personal property shall be vested in the cooperating sponsor, except as provided in the Operational Plan or TA or as A.I.D. may otherwise agree in writing, subject to the requirements of ยง 211.11 upon termination of the program.

(ii) Monetized proceeds and program income may not be used to acquire, construct, alter or upgrade land, buildings or other real property improvements that are used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes or which are owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged exclusively in religious activity. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, monetized proceeds or program income may be used to finance repair or rehabilitation of an existing structure owned or managed by a church or organization engaged exclusively in religious activity to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of donated commodities, provided that the structure is not used in whole or in part for any sectarian purpose while donated commodities are stored in it. The use of monetized proceeds or program income to finance construction of such a structure may be approved in the Operational Plan or TA or by USAID or the Diplomatic Post if the structure is needed and will be used for the storage of donated commodities for a sufficient period of time to warrant the expenditure of monetized proceeds or program income and the structure will not be used for any sectarian purpose during this period.
