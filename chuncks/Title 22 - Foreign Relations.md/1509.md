####### Evaluation requirements.

(5)In order to ensure the quality of a student internship program, a sponsor must develop procedures for evaluating all student interns. All required evaluations must be completed prior to the conclusion of a student internship program, and the student intern and his or her immediate supervisor must sign the evaluation forms. At a minimum, all programs require a concluding evaluation, and programs lasting longer than six months also require a midpoint evaluation. For programs exceeding six months' duration, at a minimum, midpoint and concluding evaluations are required. A sponsor must retain student intern evaluations (electronic or hard copy) for a period of at least three years following the completion of each student internship program.
