(1) "This agreement shall not enter into force, and may not be amended or extended, without the prior written approval of the Department of State of U.S. Government."

(2) "This agreement is subject to all United States laws and regulations related to exports and to all administrative acts of the United States Government pursuant to such laws and regulations.

(3) "The parties to this agreement agree that the obligations contained in this agreement shall not affect the performance of any obligations created by prior contracts or subcontracts which the parties may have individually or collectively with the U.S. Government."

(4) "No liability will be incurred by or attributed to the U.S. Government in connection with any possible infringement of privately owned patent or proprietary rights, either domestic or foreign by reason of the U.S. Government's approval of this agreement."

(5) "No export, sale, transfer, or other disposition of the defense articles covered by this agreement is authorized to any country outside the distribution territory without the prior written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State."

(6) "The parties to this agreement agree that an annual report of sales or other transfers pursuant to this agreement of the licensed articles, by quantity, type, U.S. dollar value, and purchaser or recipient shall be provided by (applicant or licensee) to the Department of State." This clause must specify which party is obligated to provide the annual report. Such reports may be submitted either directly by the licensee or indirectly through the licensor, and may cover calendar or fiscal years.

They may not be resold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of, to any other country or to any person other than the authorized ultimate consignee or end-user(s), either in their original form or after being incorporated into other items, without first obtaining approval from the U.S. government or as otherwise authorized by U.S. law and regulations.' "

(8) "All provisions in this agreement which refer to the United States Government and the Department of State will remain binding on the parties after the termination of the agreement."
