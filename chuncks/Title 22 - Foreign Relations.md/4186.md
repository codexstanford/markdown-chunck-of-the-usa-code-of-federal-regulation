## Chapter II - Agency for International Development
### PART 213 - CLAIMS COLLECTION
#### Subpart C - Administrative and Salary Offset
##### ยง 213.21 Employee salary offset - general.
###### Scope.

(b)The provisions of this section apply to collection by salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 of debts owed USAID and debts owed to other Federal Departments and Agencies by USAID's employees. USAID will make every effort reasonably and lawfully possible to collect administratively any amounts owed by its employees prior to initiating collection by salary offset. An amount advanced to an employee for per diem or mileage allowances in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5705, but not used for allowable travel expenses, is recoverable from the employee by salary offset without regard to the due-process provisions in ยง 213.22. This section does not apply to debts for which another statute collection explicitly provides for, or prohibits, salary offset (e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee-training expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108).
