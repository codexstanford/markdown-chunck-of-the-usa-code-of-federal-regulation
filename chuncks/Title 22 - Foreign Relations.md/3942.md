(q)The restrictions in this Regulation regarding the distribution, use or labeling of commodities shall not apply to commodities furnished by CCC in exchange for other commodities obtained from third parties ("exchanged commodities") to be distributed in a recipient country under a trilateral exchange program. Except as A.I.D. and the cooperating sponsor may otherwise agree in writing, title to the exchanged commodities will pass to the cooperating sponsor upon delivery to and acceptance by the cooperating sponsor at the point of delivery specified in the Operational Plan or TA. After title passes to the cooperating sponsor the exchanged commodities shall be deemed "commodities" covered by this Regulation with respect to all post-delivery obligations of the cooperating sponsor contained in this Regulation, including obligations regarding labeling to the extent practicable, distribution, monitoring, reporting, accounting and use of commodities or monetized proceeds resulting from their sale. In the event of difficulty in satisfying the labeling requirement, the cooperating sponsor will consult with USAID or the Diplomatic Post for guidance.
