###### Under-withholding of life insurance premiums.

(4)Title 5 U.S.C. 8707(d) provides the authority for waiving the collection of unpaid deductions that result from the underwithholding of premiums under the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program if the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:

(i) Fault is considered to exist if, in light of the circumstances, the employee knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, that an error existed, but he or she failed to take corrective action:

(ii) Factors to consider when determining whether the recovery of unpaid deduction that results from under-withholding would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:

(A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the individual from whom the Agency seeks collection;

(B) The time elapsed between the failure to withhold properly and the discovery of the failure and notification of the individual;

(C) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the individual; and

(D) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances.
