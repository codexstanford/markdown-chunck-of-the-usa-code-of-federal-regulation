####### Unusual circumstances.

(d)Whenever the statutory time limits for processing cannot be met because of "unusual circumstances" as defined in the FOIA, and DFC extends the time limits on that basis, DFC will notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which DFC estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten working days, the requester will be provided an opportunity to modify the request or agree to an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. DFC will make its FOIA Office and its FOIA Public Liaison available for this purpose and will notify the requester of the availability of the Office of Government Services (OGIS) dispute resolution services.
