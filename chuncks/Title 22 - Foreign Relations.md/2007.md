(1) By whom the document is presented for recording;

(2) On whose behalf the service is requested;

(3) Date and hour of presentation for recording;

(4) How the authenticity of the document was proved (where appropriate); and

(5) The name of the person by whom recorded (in his proper signature) and the name of the consular officer with whom compared (in his proper signature).
