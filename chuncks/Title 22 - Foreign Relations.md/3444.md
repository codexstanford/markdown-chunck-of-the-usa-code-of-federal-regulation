####### Power of attorney.

(v)Section 701 (50 U.S.C. App. 591) provides that certain powers of attorney executed by a hostage which expire by their terms after the person was captured shall be automatically extended for the period of captivity. Exceptions are made with respect to powers of attorney which by their terms clearly indicate they are to expire on the date specified irrespective of hostage status. (Section 701 applies to American hostages notwithstanding paragraph (c) thereof which states that it applies only to powers of attorney issued during the "Vietnam era".)
