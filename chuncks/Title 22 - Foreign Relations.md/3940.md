### PART 211 - TRANSFER OF FOOD COMMODITIES FOR FOOD USE IN DISASTER RELIEF, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ASSISTANCE
#### ยง 211.5 Obligations of cooperating sponsor.
##### Commodity transfer between programs.

(o)After the date of program approval by AID/W, but before distribution of the commodities, USAID or the Diplomatic Post (or the cooperating sponsor with prior approval of USAID or the Diplomatic Post) may transfer commodities between approved title II programs to meet emergency disaster requirements or to improve efficiency of operation, such as to meet temporary shortages due to delays in ocean transportation or provide for rapid distribution of stocks in danger of deterioration. Transfers also may be made to disaster organizations for use in meeting exceptional circumstances. Commodity transfers shall be made at no cost to the U.S. Government and with the concurrence of the cooperating sponsor and disaster relief organization concerned. A USAID or Diplomatic Post with funds available, however, may pay the costs of transfers to meet extraordinary relief requirements, and AID/W shall be advised promptly of the details of the transfer. Commodities transferred between programs shall not be replaced by the U.S. Government unless AID/W authorizes such replacement.
