###### ยง 92.31 Taking an acknowledgment.
####### Satisfactory identification of grantor(s).

(c)The notarizing officer must be certain of the identity of the parties making an acknowledgment. If he is not personally acquainted with the parties, he should require from each some evidence of identity, such as a passport, police identity card, or the like. The laws of some States and Territories require that the identity of an acknowledger be proved by the oath of one or more "credible witnesses", and that a statement regarding the proving of identity in this manner be included in the certificate of acknowledgment. (See ยง 92.32(b) regarding forms of certificates of acknowledgment generally.) Mere introduction of a person not known to the notarizing officer, without further proof of identity, is not considered adequate identification for acknowledgment purposes.
