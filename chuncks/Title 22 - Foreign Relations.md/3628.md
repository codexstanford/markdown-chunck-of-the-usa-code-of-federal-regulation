(d)-(1)The supplier of commodities shall be responsible for assuring that all export packaging, whether shipped from the United States or from any other source country, carries the official USAID (clasped hands) emblem. Additionally, except as USAID may otherwise prescribe, when the supplier is given notice by the importer that the importer is the government of the cooperating country or any of its subdivisions or instrumentalities, the supplier shall also be responsible for assuring that, in addition to the shipping cartons or other export packaging, all commodities carry the USAID emblem. The USAID financing document number shall be marked on each export shipping carton and box in characters at least equal in height to the shipper's marks. When commodities are shipped as containerized freight in a reusable shipping container, the container is not considered export packaging within the meaning of this paragraph and the outside of the container need not be marked; however, the cartons, boxes, etc., inside the container must be marked.
