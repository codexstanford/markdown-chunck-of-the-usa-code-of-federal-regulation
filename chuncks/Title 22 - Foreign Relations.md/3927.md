#### ยง 211.5 Obligations of cooperating sponsor.
##### By governmental cooperating sponsors.

(2)A governmental cooperating sponsor shall ensure that an audit satisfactory to A.I.D. is conducted annually with respect to donated commodities and monetized proceeds, if commodity sales are authorized under the agreement with A.I.D., including commodities and monetized proceeds transferred to or used by recipient agencies. The audit shall be a financial audit performed by the country's principal government audit agency or another audit agency or firm acceptable to A.I.D. This audit should be conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards issued by the United States General Accounting Office, or auditing standards that have been prescribed by the laws of the country or adopted by public accountants or an association of public accountants in the country, or Auditing Standards promulgated by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions or International Auditing Practices Committee of the International Federation of Accountants. Both the auditor and the auditing standards to be used by the cooperating sponsor must be acceptable to A.I.D. The cooperating sponsor may satisfy its audit responsibility with respect to recipient agencies by relying on independent audits of the recipient agency or on appropriate procedures performed by internal audit or program staff of the cooperating sponsor, by expanding the scope of the independent financial audit of the cooperating sponsor to encompass testing of recipient agency charges or actions, or by a combination of these procedures. Recipient agencies that receive less than $25,000 of donated commodities and/or monetized proceeds are excluded from the cooperating sponsor's audit responsibility.
