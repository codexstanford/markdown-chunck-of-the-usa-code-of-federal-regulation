###### Retirement benefits.

(a)A retirement annuity payable to a former spouse under ยง 20.4 is adjusted for cost-of-living increases under section 826 or 858 of the Act in the same manner as the annuity of the principal. The first such increase for a former spouse shall be prorated under the applicable section in the same way the first increase for the principal is adjusted, irrespective of whether the annuity to the former spouse commences on the same date as the annuity to the principal. If the benefit of a former spouse is based in part on an annuity supplement payable to a principal under 5 U.S.C. 8421 which is not adjusted by COLA, then that portion of the benefit payable to a former spouse is not adjusted by COLA.
