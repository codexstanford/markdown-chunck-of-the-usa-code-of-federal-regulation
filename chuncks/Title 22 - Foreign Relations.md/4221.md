The CFO generally terminates collection activity on a debt discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. USAID may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. The CFO will seek legal advice by the Office of the USAID General Counsel if he or she believes that any claims or offsets might have survived the discharge of a debtor.
