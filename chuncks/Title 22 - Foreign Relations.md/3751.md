###### Bank procedures with regard to certain suppliers.

(f)In the event a bank receives written advice from USAID concerning special conditions which are applicable to transactions of particular suppliers, such bank will use reasonable care to maintain procedures designed to ensure that accommodations thereafter furnished by it with respect to such suppliers by means of the issuance, confirmation, advising or transfer of letters of credit, or the making of payments not under letters of credit shall reflect such special conditions. While banks are expected to comply with the foregoing obligation, a bank which has used reasonable care to establish and maintain such procedures will not be responsible for any inadvertent furnishing of any such accommodation not containing applicable special conditions or the making of payment thereunder. For the purpose of ascertaining whether the supplier is a person or organization subject to an USAID advice concerning special conditions applicable to its transactions under this paragraph, a bank, in making payment under a letter of credit or otherwise, may consider as supplier the person or organization issuing the invoice.
