The license for temporary export must be presented to the Port Director of U.S. Customs and Border Protection who, upon verification, will endorse the exit column on the reverse side of the license. The license for temporary export must be electronically submitted to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, unless electronic reporting of such information is unavailable, in which case U.S. Customs and Border Protection will issue instructions.

In the case of a military aircraft or vessel temporarily exported under its own power, evidence that the Department of State has duly authorized it to leave the United States must be readily available on board the aircraft or vessel.

(c) Any temporary export license for hardware that is used, regardless of whether the hardware was exported directly to the foreign destination or returned directly from the foreign destination, must be endorsed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the procedures in ยง 123.22 of this subchapter.
