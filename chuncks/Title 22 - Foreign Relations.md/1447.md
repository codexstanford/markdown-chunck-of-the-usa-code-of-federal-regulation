####### Change of activity.

(h)At the discretion and approval of the responsible officer, professors may freely engage in research and research scholars may freely engage in teaching and lecturing. Because these activities are intertwined, such a change of activity is not considered a change of category necessitating formal approval by the Department of State and does not require the issuance of a new Form DS-2019 to reflect a change in category. Such change in activity does not extend the exchange visitor's maximum duration of program participation.
