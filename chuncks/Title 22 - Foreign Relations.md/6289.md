###### ยง 706.4 Preservation and transfer of records.
####### Transfer of records to the National Archives.

(b)Under the Records Disposal Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33, DFC is required to transfer legal custody and control of records with permanent historical value to the National Archives. DFC's Finance Project and Insurance Contract Case files generally do not qualify as records with permanent historical value. DFC will not transfer these files except when the National Archives determines that an individual project or case is especially significant or unique. If the National Archives receives a FOIA request for records that have been transferred it will respond to the request in accordance with its own FOIA regulations.
