####### Receipt of public benefit.

(e)Receipt of public benefit occurs when a public benefit-granting agency provides a public benefit, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, to the alien as a beneficiary, whether in the form of cash, voucher, services, or insurance coverage. Application or certification for a public benefit does not constitute receipt of public benefit, but it may be considered as a factor suggesting likelihood of future receipt. An alien's receipt of, application for, or certification for public benefit solely on behalf of another individual does not constitute receipt of, application for, or certification for such alien.
