####### Emergency expenditure authorization.

(d)When a medical emergency prohibits the delay inherent in contacting the Department and receiving authority to expend funds, the consular officer can expend up to an amount to be established by the Department without prior Departmental approval if:

(1) Symptoms determine eligibility for emergency medical treatment; or

(2) An immediate medical examination is warranted in order to verify the alleged abuse of a U.S. national prisoner by arresting or confining authorities; or

(3) Immediate emergency medical treatment or surgery is necessary to prevent death or permanent disablement, and there is insufficient time to explore private funds or obtain Department approval; and

(4) A promissory note already has been executed by the prisoner, or if the circumstances warrant, by the consular officer without recourse.
