#### ยง 305.4 Medical status eligibility standard.
##### Reasonable accommodation.

(d)(1) The term "accommodation" means modifications to the Peace Corps' policies, practices or procedures.

(2) An accommodation is not reasonable if:

(i) It would modify the essential eligibility requirements for a Volunteer;

(ii) It would modify, among other things, the Applicant's Volunteer assignment or the Peace Corps' medical program in a way that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service, program, or activity; or

(iii) It would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the operations of the Peace Corps, including its medical program.

(3) In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the operations of the Peace Corps, the Peace Corps may take into account, among other things:

(i) The size and composition of the Peace Corps staff at the post of assignment;

(ii) The adequacy of local medical facilities and the availability of other medical facilities;

(iii) The nature and cost of the accommodation compared to the overall number of Volunteers and the overall size of the Peace Corps budget; and

(iv) The capacities of the host country agency and of the host community to which the Applicant would be assigned.
