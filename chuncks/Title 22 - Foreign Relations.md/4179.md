###### Interagency offset.

(b)The CFO may offset a debt owed to another Federal Department or Agency from amounts due or payable by USAID to the debtor, or may request another Federal Department or Agency to offset a debt owed to USAID. The CFO, through USAID's cross-servicing arrangement with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, may request the Internal Revenue Service to offset an overdue debt from a Federal income-tax refund due to the debtor. Fiscal Service may also garnish the salary of a private-sector employee when reasonable attempts to obtain payment have failed. USAID will make interagency offsets from an employee's salary in accordance with the procedures contained in §§ 213.22 and 213.23.
