###### Triangular transactions.

(c)When a transaction involves three or more countries that have adopted the IC/DV procedure, the governments of these countries may stamp a triangular symbol on the Import Certificate. This symbol is usually placed on the Import Certificate when the applicant for the Import Certificate (the importer) states either (1) that there is uncertainty whether the items covered by the Import Certificate will be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; (2) that he or she knows that the items will not be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; or (3) that, if the items are to be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate, they will subsequently be reexported to another destination. All parties, including the ultimate consignee in the country of ultimate destination, must be shown on the completed Import Certificate.
