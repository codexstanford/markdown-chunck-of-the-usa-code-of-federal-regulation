##### ยง 123.5 Temporary export licenses.

(a) The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may issue a license for the temporary export of unclassified defense articles (DSP-73). Such licenses are valid only if the article will be exported for a period of less than 4 years and will be returned to the United States and transfer of title will not occur during the period of temporary export. Accordingly, articles exported pursuant to a temporary export license may not be sold or otherwise permanently transferred to a foreign person while they are overseas under a temporary export license. A renewal of the license or other written approval must be obtained from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls if the article is to remain outside the United States beyond the period for which the license is valid.
