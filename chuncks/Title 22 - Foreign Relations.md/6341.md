####### When notice to submitters is required.

(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, DFC's FOIA Office will use reasonable efforts to notify a submitter in writing whenever:

(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as confidential commercial information protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

(ii) DFC has reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.

(2) This notification will describe the nature and scope of the request, advise the submitter of its right to submit written objections in response to the request, and provide a reasonable time for response. The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include copies of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.
