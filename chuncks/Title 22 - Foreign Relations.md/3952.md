#### ยง 211.7 Arrangements for entry and handling in foreign country.
##### Authorization for reimbursement of costs.

(e)If, because of packaging damage, a cooperating sponsor determines that commodities must be repackaged to ensure that the commodities arrive at the distribution point in a wholesome condition, the cooperating sponsor may incur expenses for such repackaging up to $500 and such costs will be reimbursed by CCC. If costs will exceed $500, the authority to repackage and incur the costs must be approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post in advance of repackaging unless such prior approval is specifically waived, in writing, by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. For losses in transit, the $500 limitation shall apply to all commodities which are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port of destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier. For other losses, the $500 limitation shall apply to each loss situation, e.g., if 700 bags are damaged in a warehouse due to an earthquake, the $500 limitation applies to the total cost of repackaging the 700 bags. Shipments may not be artificially divided in order to avoid the limitation of $500 or for obtaining prior approval to incur repackaging costs.
