### PART 503 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REGULATION
#### ยง 503.8 Exemptions.
##### Balancing test.

(1)In deciding whether to release records that contain personal or private information about someone else to a requester, we weigh the foreseeable harm of invading that individual's privacy against the public benefit that would result from the release of the information. In our evaluation of requests for records, we attempt to guard against the release of information that might involve a violation of personal privacy by a requester being able to "piece together items" or "read between the lines" information that would normally be exempt from mandatory disclosure.
