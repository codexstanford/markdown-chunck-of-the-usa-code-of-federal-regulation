(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each Inter-American Foundation award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces-

(1) To the Inter-American Foundation official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by Inter-American Foundation officials or their designated representatives.
