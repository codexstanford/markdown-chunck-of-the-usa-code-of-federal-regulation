####### Multitrack processing.

(b)DFC has a track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. Non-expedited requests will be placed into a "simple" or "complex" track based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. DFC will consider the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. DFC will advise the requester into which track the request falls and, when appropriate, will offer requesters the opportunity to narrow or modify the request so that it can be placed in a different track.
