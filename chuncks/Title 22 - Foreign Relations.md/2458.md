(a) Any export, as defined in this subchapter, of a defense article controlled by this subchapter, to include defense articles transiting the United States, requires the electronic reporting of export information. The reporting of the export information shall be to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection using its electronic system(s), or directly to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), as appropriate. Before the export of any hardware, via a license or other authorization, the DDTC registered applicant/exporter, or an agent acting on the filer's behalf, must electronically submit export information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, unless electronic reporting is unavailable, in which case U.S. Customs and Border Protection will issue instructions (paragraph (b) of this section). In addition to electronically providing the export information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection before export, all mandatory supporting documentation (e.g., attachments, certifications, proof of filing in U.S. Customs and Border Protection's system(s) such as the Internal Transaction Number (ITN)) must be submitted electronically, unless electronic reporting of such information is unavailable, in which case U.S. Customs and Border Protection will issue instructions.

(1) If necessary, an export may be made through a port other than the one designated on the license if the exporter complies with the procedures established by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

(2) When a defense article is temporarily exported from the United States and subsequently moved from one destination authorized on a license to another destination authorized on the same or another temporary license, the applicant, or an agent acting on the applicant's behalf, must ensure that U.S. Customs and Border Protection decrements both temporary licenses to show the exit and entry of the hardware.
