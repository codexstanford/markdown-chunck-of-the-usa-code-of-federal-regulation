#### PART 713 - PRODUCTION OF NONPUBLIC RECORDS AND TESTIMONY OF EMPLOYEES IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
##### ยง 713.10 Definitions.
###### Nonpublic records

means any DFC records which are exempt from disclosure by statute or under Part 706, DFC's regulations implementing the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. For example, this may include records created in connection with DFC's receipt, evaluation and action on actual and proposed DFC finance projects and insurance policies (whether such projects or policies were cancelled or not), including all reports, internal memoranda, opinions, interpretations, and correspondence, whether prepared by DFC employees or by persons under contract, as well as confidential business information submitted by parties seeking to do business with DFC. Whether DFC has actually chosen in practice to apply any exemption to specific documents is irrelevant to the question of whether they are "nonpublic" for the purposes of this Part.
