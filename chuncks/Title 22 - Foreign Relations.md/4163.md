###### Waivers for the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

(e)(1) The CFO will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on the portion of the debt paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue. The CFO may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by case basis, when he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the Federal Government. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final, and is not subject to further review.

(2) The CFO may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive the collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalties, or administrative costs, when he or she determines that-

(i) A waiver is justified under the standards for the compromise of claims under ยง 213.25; or

(ii) Collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience, or is not in the best interest of the United States.

(3) The CFO may make a decision to waive interest, penalties, or administrative costs at any time.
