####### Participant compensation.

(i)(1) Sponsors must inform program participants of Federal, State, and Local Minimum Wage requirements, and ensure that at a minimum, participants are compensated at the higher of:

(i) The applicable Federal, State, or Local Minimum Wage (including overtime); or

(ii) Pay and benefits commensurate with those offered to their similarly situated U.S. counterparts.

(2) Sponsors must demonstrate that participants are also compensated according to the above standards in the following (and similar) situations:

(i) The host employers provide housing and/or transportation as part of participants' compensation, but the compensation package does not explain that the lower hourly wage reflects such benefits; or

(ii) The employers compensate participants on a "piece" basis (e.g., number of rooms cleaned). If at the end of each pay period, the participant's earnings under the piece rate do not equal at least the amount the participant would have earned had the participant been paid the predominant local wage as provided in subparagraph (1), the participant's pay must be supplemented at that time so that the participant's earnings are at least as much as the required local wage as provided in subparagraph (1).

(3) Sponsors must ensure that appropriate assistance is provided to participants on an as-needed basis and that sponsors are available to participants (and host employers) to assist as facilitators, counselors, and information resources.
