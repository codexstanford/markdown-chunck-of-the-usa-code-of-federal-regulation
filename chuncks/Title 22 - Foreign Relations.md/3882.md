##### Governmental cooperating sponsor

(2)means a foreign government which has signed a Transfer Authorization under which agricultural commodities are donated for emergency purposes only. Governmental cooperating sponsors are treated here as a group separate from other cooperating sponsors since they are eligible only for emergency programs and their circumstances are different in such matters as rules governing shipping and in certain other aspects of agreements.
