####### Stay of eviction.

(l)Section 300 (50 U.S.C. App. 530) provides that a captive's dependents shall not be evicted from their dwelling if the rental is minimal, except upon leave of a court. If it is proved that inability to pay rent is a result of being in captivity, the court is authorized to stay eviction proceedings for not longer than 3 months. An amendment extends relief to owners of the premises with respect to payment on mortgage and taxes.
