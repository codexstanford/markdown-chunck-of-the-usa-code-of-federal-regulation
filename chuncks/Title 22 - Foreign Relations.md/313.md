(a)If a participant or former participant is divorced prior to commencement of annuity, any former spouse shall be entitled to a pro rata share of such a principal's maximum regular survivor annuity (based on service performed prior to the first date the principal becomes eligible for an annuity following the divorce) unless a different amount is elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/ER/RET within 12 months after the divorce becomes final or at the time of the retirement, whichever occurs first, or unless a different amount is specified by a court prior to the death of the principal. The principal's annuity shall be reduced at the commencing date under ยง 19.10-2 in order to provide the survivor annuity committed to the former spouse.
