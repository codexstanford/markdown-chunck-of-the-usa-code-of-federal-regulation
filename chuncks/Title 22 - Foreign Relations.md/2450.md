###### Exports.

(b)The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require the IC/DV procedure on proposed exports of defense articles to non-government entities in those countries participating in IC/DV procedures. In such cases, U.S. exporters must submit both an export license application (the completed Form DSP-5) and the original Import Certificate, which must be provided and authenticated by the government of the importing country. This document verifies that the foreign importer complied with the import regulations of the government of the importing country and that the importer declared the intention not to divert, transship or reexport the material described therein without the prior approval of that government. After delivery of the commodities to the foreign consignee, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may also require U.S. exporters to furnish Delivery Verification documentation from the government of the importing country. This documentation verifies that the delivery was in accordance with the terms of the approved export license. Both the Import Certificate and the Delivery Verification must be furnished to the U.S. exporter by the foreign importer.
