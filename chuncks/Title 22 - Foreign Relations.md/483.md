####### Under-withholding of life insurance premiums.

(6)5 U.S.C. 8707(d) provides authority for waiving the collection of unpaid deductions resulting from under-withholding of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program premiums if the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience.

(i) Fault is considered to exist if in light of the circumstances the employee knew or should have known through the exercise of due diligence that an error existed but failed to take corrective action.

(ii) Factors to be considered when determining whether recovery of unpaid deduction resulting from under-withholding would be against equity and good conscience include, but are not limited to:

(A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the individual from whom collection is sought.

(B) The time elapsed between the failure to properly withhold and discovery of the failure and notification of the individual;

(C) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the individual;

(D) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances.
