####### Customary practice.

(a)Under Federal law (Rule 28(b), Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States) and under the laws of some of the States, a commission to take depositions can be issued to a foreign official or to a private person in a foreign country. However, this method is rarely used; commissions are generally issued to U.S. notarizing officers. In those countries where U.S. notarizing officers are not permitted to take testimony (see ยง 92.55(c)) and where depositions must be taken before a foreign authority, letters rogatory are usually issued to a foreign court.
