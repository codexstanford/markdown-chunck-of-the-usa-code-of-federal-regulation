###### ยง 92.27 Affiant's allegations in affidavit.
####### Veracity of allegations.

(b)Notarizing officers are not required to examine into the truth of the affiant's allegations or to pass upon any contentious questions involved. In many instances the matters referred to in an affidavit will be of a technical or special nature beyond the officer's general knowledge or experience. However, he may, in certain circumstances, refuse to take an affidavit. (See ยง 92.9 regarding the types of situations in which an officer might properly refuse to perform a notarial service; also see ยง 92.10 regarding the waiver and other statements which may be included in a notarial certificate where evidence exists of falsity in the affiant's declaration.)
