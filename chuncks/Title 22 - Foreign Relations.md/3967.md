#### ยง 211.9 Liability for loss damage or improper distribution of commodities.
##### Reporting losses to USAID or the Diplomatic Post.

(f)(1) The cooperating sponsor shall provide the USAID or Diplomatic Post a quarterly report regarding any loss, damage or misuse of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income. The report must be provided within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter and shall contain the following information except for commodity losses less than $500: who had possession of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income; who, if anyone, might be responsible for the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantity of commodities; the size and type of containers; the time and place of loss, damage or misuse; the current location of the commodities; the program number; CCC contract number, if known, and if not known, other identifying numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action taken by the cooperating sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the estimated value of the loss, damage or misuse. If any of this information is not available, the cooperating sponsor shall explain why it is not. The report simply may identify separately commodity losses valued at less than $500 and indicate the estimated value of the commodities lost damaged or misused and the action taken by the cooperating sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal, except that the cooperating sponsor shall inform the USAID or Diplomatic Post if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend in the loss, damage or misuse of such commodities and provide the information described above for losses of $500 or more together with such other information available to it. USAID or the Diplomatic Post may require additional information about any commodities lost, damaged or misused. Information in the quarterly report may be provided in tabular form to the extent possible, and the report shall enclose a copy of any claim made by the cooperating sponsor during the reporting period.

(2) If any commodity, monetized proceeds or program income is lost or misused under circumstances which give a cooperating sponsor reason to believe that the loss or misuse has occurred as a result of criminal activity, the cooperating sponsor shall promptly report these circumstances to the A.I.D. Inspector General through AID/W, USAID or the Diplomatic Post, and subsequently to the appropriate authorities of the cooperating country unless instructed not to do so by A.I.D. The cooperating sponsor also shall cooperate fully with any subsequent investigation by the Inspector General and/or authorities of the cooperating country.
