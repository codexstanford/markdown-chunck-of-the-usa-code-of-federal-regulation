##### ยง 141.8 Hearings.
###### Consolidated or joint hearings; hearings before other agencies.

(e)In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Secretary may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part, except that procedural requirements of the hearing agency if other than this Department may be adopted insofar as it is determined by the Secretary that variations from the procedures described in this section or elsewhere as may be required under this part do not impair the rights of the parties. The Secretary may also transfer the hearing of any complaint to any other department or agency, with the consent of that Department or Agency (1) where Federal financial assistance to the applicant or recipient of the other Department or Agency is substantially greater than that of the Department of State, or (2) upon determination by the Secretary that such transfer would be in the best interests of the Government of effectuating this part. Final decisions in all such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with ยง 141.9.
