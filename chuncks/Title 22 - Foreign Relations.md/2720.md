###### Statement of Registration Certification.

(c)The Statement of Registration (form DS-2032) of the intended registrant shall include a certification by an authorized senior officer of the following:

(1) Whether the intended registrant or its parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate listed in the Statement of Registration, or any of its chief executive officers, presidents, vice presidents, secretaries, partners, members, other senior officers or officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel), or any member of the board of directors of the intended registrant, or of any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate listed in the Statement of Registration:

(i) Has ever been indicted or otherwise charged (e.g., charged by criminal information in lieu of indictment) for or has been convicted of violating any U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in § 120.6 of this subchapter or violating a foreign criminal law on exportation of defense articles where conviction of such law carries a minimum term of imprisonment of greater than 1 year; or

(ii) Is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. Government; and

(2) Whether the intended registrant is foreign owned or foreign controlled (see § 120.65 of this subchapter). If the intended registrant is foreign owned or foreign controlled, the certification shall include an explanation of such ownership or control, including the identities of the foreign person or persons who ultimately own or control the registrant. This requirement applies to a registrant who is a U.S. person and is owned or controlled by a foreign person. It also applies to a registrant who is a foreign person and is owned or controlled by a foreign person from the same country or a foreign person from another country.

(d) A registrant must, within five days of the event, provide to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls a written notification, signed by a senior officer (e.g., chief executive officer, president, secretary, partner, member, treasurer, general counsel), if:

(1) Any of the persons referred to in § 129.8(c) is indicted or otherwise charged (e.g., charged by criminal information in lieu of indictment) for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in § 120.6 of this subchapter or violating a foreign criminal law on exportation of defense articles where conviction of such law carries a minimum term of imprisonment of greater than 1 year; or becomes ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to export or import defense articles or defense services from, any agency of the U.S.Government; or

(2) There is a change in the following information contained in the Statement of Registration (form DS-2032):

(i) Registrant's name;

(ii) Registrant's address;

(iii) Registrant's legal organization structure;

(iv) Ownership or control;

(v) The establishment, acquisition or divestment of a U.S. or foreign subsidiary or other affiliate who is engaged in brokering activities or otherwise required to be listed in registrant's Statement of Registration; or

(vi) Board of directors, senior officers, partners and owners.

(e) A U.S. or foreign registrant must provide written notification to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at least sixty (60) days in advance of any intended sale or transfer to a foreign person of ownership or control of the registrant or any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate listed and covered in its Statement of Registration. Such notice does not relieve the registrant from obtaining any prior approval required under this subchapter.

(f) The new entity formed when a registrant merges with another company or acquires, or is acquired by, another company or a subsidiary or division of another company, shall advise the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the following:

(1) The new firm name and all previous firm names;

(2) The registration number that will continue and those that are to be discontinued (if any); and

(3) The numbers of all approvals for brokering activities under the continuing registration number, since any approval not the subject of notification will be considered invalid.

(g) A registrant whose registration lapses because of failure to renew and, after an intervening period, seeks to register again must pay registration fees for any part of such intervening period during which the registrant engaged in the business of brokering activities.
