##### Urgency to inform.

(ii)The information requested should pertain to a matter of a current exigency to the American public, where delay in response would compromise a significant recognized interest. The person requesting expedited access under an "urgency to inform," must be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information. This does not include individuals who are engaged only incidentally in the dissemination of information. "Primarily engaged" requires that information dissemination be the main activity of the requester. A requester only incidentally engaged in information dissemination, besides other activities, would not satisfy this requirement. The public's right to know, although a significant and important value, would not by itself be sufficient to satisfy this standard.
