####### The alien's age.

(1)Consular officers will consider whether the alien's age makes the alien more likely than not to become a public charge in the totality of the circumstances, such as by impacting the alien's ability to work. Consular officers will consider an alien's age between 18 and early retirement age as defined in 42 U.S.C. 416(l)(2) as a positive factor. Age is a negative factor for aliens who are under the age of 18. However, consular officers may consider other factors, such as the support provided to a minor child by a parent, legal guardian, or other source, that in the totality of the circumstances may offset the alien's age as a negative factor. An alien's age above early retirement age is a negative factor in the totality of the circumstances, if the consular officer believes it adversely affects the alien's ability to obtain or perform work, or may increase the potential for healthcare related costs that would be borne by the public.
