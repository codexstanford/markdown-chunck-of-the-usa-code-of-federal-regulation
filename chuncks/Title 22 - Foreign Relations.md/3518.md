#### PART 194 - INTER-AMERICAN COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION COMMISSION RULES OF PROCEDURE
##### Appendix A to Part 194 - Inter-American Commercial Arbitration Commission Rules of Procedure (As Amended April 1, 2002)

1. Where the parties to a contract have agreed in writing that disputes in relation to that contract shall be referred to arbitration under the IACAC Rules of Procedure, then such disputes shall be settled in accordance with these Rules subject to such modification as the parties may agree in writing and the IACAC may approve.

2. These Rules shall govern the arbitration, except that where any such rule is in conflict with any provision of the law applicable to the arbitration from which the parties cannot derogate, that provision shall prevail.

1. For the purposes of these rules, any notice, including a notification, communication or proposal, is deemed to have been received if it is physically delivered to the addressee in person or via fax, telex or any other means agreed to by the parties, or if it is delivered at his habitual residence, place of business or mailing address, or, if none of these can be found after making reasonable inquiry, then at the addressee's last known habitual residence or at his last known place of business. Notice shall be deemed to have been received on the day it is so delivered by any of the means stated in these rules.

2. For the purposes of calculating a period of time under these rules, such period shall begin to run on the day following the day when a notice, notification, communication or proposal is received. If the last day of such period is an official holiday or a non-business day at the residence or place of business of the addressee, the period is extended until the first business day which follows. Official holidays or non-business days occurring during the running of the period of time are included in calculating the period.

1. The party initiating recourse to arbitration (hereinafter referred to as the "claimant") shall give to the other party (hereinafter referred to as the "respondent") a notice requesting arbitration and shall provide a copy to the Director General of the IACAC, either directly or through the IACAC National Section if one exists in his country of domicile.

2. Arbitral proceedings shall be deemed to commence on the date on which the notice of arbitration is received by the respondent.

3. The request for arbitration shall at least include the following:

(a) A request that the dispute be submitted to arbitration;

(b) The names and addresses of the parties;

(c) A copy of the arbitration clause or the separate arbitration agreement;

(d) A reference to the contract out of which, or in relation to which, the dispute has arisen, and a copy thereof if the claimant deems it necessary;

(e) The general nature of the claim and an indication of the amount involved, if any;

(f) The relief or remedy sought;

(g) If three arbitrators are to be appointed, designation of one arbitrator, as referred to in Article 5, paragraph 3.

4. The request for arbitration may also include the statement of claim referred to in Article 15.

5. Upon receipt of the notice of arbitration, the Director General of the IACAC or the IACAC National Section shall communicate with all parties with respect to the arbitration and shall acknowledge the commencement of the arbitration.

The parties may be represented or assisted by persons of their choice. The names and addresses of such persons must be communicated in writing to the other party; such communication must specify whether the appointment is being made for purposes of representation or assistance.

1. If the parties have not otherwise agreed, three arbitrators shall be appointed.

2. When the parties have agreed that the dispute will be resolved by a single arbitrator, he may be appointed by the mutual agreement of the parties. If the parties have not done so within thirty (30) days from the date on which the notice of arbitration is received by the respondent, the arbitrator will be designated by the IACAC.

3. If three arbitrators are to be appointed, each party shall appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators thus appointed shall choose the third arbitrator, who will act as the presiding arbitrator of the tribunal.

4. If within thirty (30) days after receipt of the claimant's notification of the appointment of an arbitrator, the other party has not notified the first party with a copy to the Director General of the IACAC either directly or through the IACAC National Section if one exists in his country of domicile, of the arbitrator he has appointed, the arbitrator will be designated by the IACAC.

5. If within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the second arbitrator, the two arbitrators have not agreed on the choice of the presiding arbitrator, the presiding arbitrator will be appointed by the IACAC.

6. In making appointments, the IACAC shall have regard to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of independent and impartial arbitrators, and shall also take into account the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than the nationalities of the parties.

7. The IACAC may request from either party any information it deems necessary in order to discharge its functions.

A prospective arbitrator shall disclose to those who approach him in connection with his possible appointment any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence. An arbitrator, once appointed or chosen, shall disclose such circumstances to the parties and to the IACAC, if appointed by the IACAC, unless they have already been informed by him of these circumstances.

1. Any arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence.

2. A party may challenge the arbitrator appointed by him only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment has been made.

1. A party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall send notice of his challenge within fifteen days after the appointment of the challenged arbitrator has been notified to the challenging party or within fifteen days after the circumstances mentioned in Articles 6 and 7 became known to that party.

2. The challenge shall be notified to the other party, to the arbitrator who is challenged and to the other members of the arbitral tribunal and to the Director General of the IACAC. The notification shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the challenge.

3. When an arbitrator has been challenged by one party, the other party may agree to the challenge. The arbitrator may also, after the challenge, withdraw from his office. In neither case does this imply acceptance of the validity of the grounds for the challenge. In both cases the procedure provided in article 5 shall be used in full for the appointment of the substitute arbitrator, even if during the process of appointing the challenged arbitrator a party had failed to exercise his right to appoint or to participate in the appointment.

1. If the other party does not agree to the challenge and the challenged arbitrator does not withdraw, the decision on the challenge will be made by the IACAC.

2. If the IACAC sustains the challenge, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed or chosen pursuant to the procedure applicable to the appointment or choice of an arbitrator as provided in these rules.

1. In the event of the death or resignation of an arbitrator during the course of the arbitral proceedings, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed or chosen pursuant to the procedure applicable to the appointment or choice of the arbitrator being replaced.
