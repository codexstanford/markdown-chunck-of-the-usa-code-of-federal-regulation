##### ยง 19.11-6 Death during active duty.
###### Annuity for surviving spouse.

(b)If a participant who has at least 19 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System, excluding extra service credited for unhealthful post duty in accordance with section 816 of the Act, dies before separation from the Service, and is survived by a spouse as defined in ยง 19.2(v) such survivor shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with ยง 19.10-1 less any annuity payable to a former spouse under paragraph a. If the participant had less than three years of creditable civilian service at the time of death, the survivor annuity is computed on the basis of the average salary for the entire period of such service. If, at time of death, the participant had less than 20 years of creditable service, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, but such additional service credit shall in no case exceed the difference between the participant's age on the date of death and age 65. A spouse is entitled to an additional survivor annuity under ยง 19.10-5 provided death occurs on or after the effective date of a spousal agreement providing for the additional annuity.
