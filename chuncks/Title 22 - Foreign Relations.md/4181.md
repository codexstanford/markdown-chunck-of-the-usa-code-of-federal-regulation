###### Review of a decision to offset the debt.

(d)(1) USAID will not offset the debt while a debtor is seeking review of the debt under this section, or under another statute, regulation, or contract. However, interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue during this period, unless otherwise waived by the CFO. The CFO may initiate offset as soon as practical after the completion of a review, or after a debtor waives the opportunity to request review.

(2) The debtor must provide a written request for review of the decision to offset the debt no later than 15 days after the date of the notice of the offset unless a different time is specifically prescribed. The debtor's request must state the basis for the request for review.

(3) The CFO may grant an extension of time for filing a request for review if the debtor shows good cause for the late filing. A debtor who fails timely to file or to request an extension waives the right to review.

(4) The CFO will issue, no later than 60 days after the filing of the request, a written final decision based on the evidence, record and applicable law.
