#### ยง 503.8 Exemptions.
##### The deliberative process privilege.

(1)This privilege protects predecisional deliberative communications. A communication is protected under this privilege if it was made before a final decision was reached on some question of policy and if it expressed recommendations or opinions on that question. The purpose of this privilege is to prevent injury to the quality of the agency decision making process by encouraging open and frank internal policy discussions, by avoiding premature disclosure of policies not yet adopted, and by avoiding the public confusion that might result from disclosing reasons that were not in fact the ultimate grounds for an agency's decision. This privilege continues to protect pre-decisional documents even after a decision is made. We will release purely factual material in a deliberative document unless that material is otherwise exempt. However, purely factual material in a deliberative document is within this privilege if:

(i) It is inextricably intertwined with the deliberative portions so that it cannot reasonably be segregated; or

(ii) It would reveal the nature of the deliberative portions, or

(iii) Its disclosure would in some other way make possible an intrusion into the decision making process.
