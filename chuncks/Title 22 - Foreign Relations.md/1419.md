####### Valid program status of exchange visitor.

(a)Sponsors must notify the Department of State via SEVIS of the following:

(1) Validation of program participation. Sponsors must promptly validate an exchange visitor's participation in their program. This will change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS record from "Initial" to "Active." SEVIS records with program durations (e.g., the period between the "Program Begin Date" and "Program End Date") of 30 days or more must be validated within 30 days following the "Program Begin Date" identified in SEVIS. SEVIS records with program durations that are less than 30 days must be validated prior to the "Program End Date" reflected in SEVIS. As part of the validation process, sponsors may amend the program begin date and must update the SEVIS record to reflect the actual and current U.S. address and site of activity in SEVIS. The status of SEVIS records that are not validated according to this schedule will automatically change to "Invalid" or "No Show". Accompanying spouses and dependents' SEVIS records are automatically validated upon validation of the exchange visitors' SEVIS records.
