####### Definitions.,Police certificate

(c)(1)means a certification by the police or other appropriate authorities reporting information entered in their records relating to the alien. In the case of the country of an alien's nationality and the country of an alien's current residence (as of the time of visa application) the term "appropriate police authorities" means those of a country, area or locality in which the alien has resided for at least six months. In the case of all other countries, areas, or localities, the term "appropriate police authorities" means the authorities of any country, area, or locality in which the alien has resided for at least one year. A consular officer may require a police certificate regardless of length of residence in any country if he or she has reason to believe that a police record exists in the country, area, or locality concerned.
