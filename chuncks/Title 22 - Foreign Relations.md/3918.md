##### Processing, handling, transportation and other costs.

(c)(1) Except as othervise provided in the Operational Plan or TA, the United States will pay in accordance with this paragraph (c) processing, handling, transportation, and other incidental costs incurred in making commodities available to cooperating sponsors at U.S. ports or U.S. inland destinations, up to the point at which the ocean carrier takes possession of the cargo.

(2) The United States will finance the transfer of commodities at the lowest combination inland and ocean transportation costs as determined by the United States and in sizes and types of packages announced as applicable. If a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor requests changes to these standards which are made by the United States as an accommodation to the cooperating sponsor and these changes result in costs over those the United States otherwise would have incurred, the cooperating sponsor shall reimburse the United States for these increased costs promptly upon request.

(3) All costs and expenses incurred subsequent to the transfer of title to cooperating sponsors shall be borne by them except as otherwise provided herein. Upon the determination that it is in the interests of the program to do so, the United States may pay or reimburse the following additional costs:

(i) Ocean transportation costs from U.S. ports to the designated ports of entry abroad; or

(ii) Ocean transportation costs from U.S. ports to designated points of entry abroad in the case-

(A) Of landlocked countries,

(B) Where ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disturbances,

(C) Where carriers to a specific country are unavailable, or

(D) Where a substantial savings in cost or time can be effected by the utilization of points of entry other than ports; or

(iii) In the case of commodities for urgent and extraordinary relief requirements, including prepositioned commodities, transportation costs from designated points of entry or ports of entry abroad to storage and distribution centers and associated storage and distribution costs.
