###### ยง 92.31 Taking an acknowledgment.
####### Personal appearance of grantor(s).,i.e.

(b)A notarizing officer taking an acknowledgment should always require the personal appearance of the grantor(s),, the person or persons who have signed the instrument to be acknowledged. Since the officer states in his certificate that the parties did personally appear before him, failure to observe this requirement invalidates the notarial act and makes the officer liable to the charge of negligence and of having executed a false certificate. A notarizing officer should never take an acknowledgment by telephone.
