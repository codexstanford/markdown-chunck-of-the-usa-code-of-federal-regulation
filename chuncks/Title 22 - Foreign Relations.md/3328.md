###### ยง 171.14 Fees to be charged.
####### When certain fees are not charged.

(i)The Department shall not charge search fees (or in the case of educational and non-commercial scientific institutions or representatives of the news media, duplication fees) when the Department fails to comply with any time limit under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6), unless unusual circumstances (see ยง 171.11(b)) or exceptional circumstances exist. Exceptional circumstances cannot include a delay that results from a predictable agency workload of requests unless the agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C). Apart from the stated provisions regarding waiver or reduction of fees, see ยง 171.16, the Department retains the administrative discretion to not assess fees if it is in the best interests of the government to do so.
