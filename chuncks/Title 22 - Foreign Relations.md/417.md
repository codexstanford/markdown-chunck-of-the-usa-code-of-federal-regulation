###### Stolen or confiscated property.

(c)If the claimant was required to buy back confiscated property from the foreign country, the claimant may apply for reimbursement of such charges under section 3 of the Act. Any other property confiscated is reimbursable from this Guaranty Fund. Confiscated property is divided into the following categories:

(1) Compensation for confiscation of vessels, where no buy-back has occurred, will be based on market value which will be determined by averaging estimates of market value obtained from as many vessel surveyors or brokers as the Secretary deems practicable;

(2) Compensation for capital equipment other than a vessel, will be based on depreciated replacement cost;

(3) Compensation for expendable items and crew's belongings will be 50 percent of their replacement cost; and

(4) Compensation for confiscated catch will be for full value, based on the price-per-pound.
