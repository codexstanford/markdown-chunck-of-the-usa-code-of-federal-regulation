## Chapter V - United States Agency for Global Media
### PART 503 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REGULATION
#### ยง 503.9 Electronic records.
##### Multitrack first-in first-out processing.

(1)(i) Because the agency expects to be able to process its requests without a backlog of cases, BBG will not institute a multitract system. Those cases that may be handled easily, because they require only a few documents or a simple answer, will be handled immediately by an FOIA specialist.

(ii) If you wish to qualify for faster processing, you may limit the scope of your request so that we may respond more quickly.
