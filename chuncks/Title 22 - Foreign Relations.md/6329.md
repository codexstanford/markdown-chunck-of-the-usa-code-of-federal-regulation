####### Aggregating requests.

(e)For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, DFC may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. DFC will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
