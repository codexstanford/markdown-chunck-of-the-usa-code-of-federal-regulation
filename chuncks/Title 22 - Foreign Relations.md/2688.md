###### Matters considered on appeal.

(c)An appeal will be considered upon the basis of the assembled record. This record consists of (but is not limited to) the charging letter, the respondent's answer, the transcript or magnetic recording of the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge, the report of the Administrative Law Judge, the order of the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, and any other relevant documents involved in the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge. The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security may direct a rehearing and reopening of the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge if he or she finds that the record is insufficient or that new evidence is relevant and material to the issues and was not known and was not reasonably available to the respondent at the time of the original hearings.
