##### ยง 126.14 Special comprehensive export authorizations for NATO, Australia, Japan, and Sweden.
###### Major project authorization.

(1)With respect to NATO members, Australia, Japan, and Sweden, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may provide comprehensive authorizations for well circumscribed commercially developed "major projects", where a principal registered U.S. exporter/prime contractor identifies in advance the broad parameters of a commercial project including defense exports needed, other participants (e.g., exporters with whom they have "teamed up," or subcontractors), and foreign government end users. Projects eligible for such authorization may include a commercial export of a major weapons system for a foreign government involving, for example, multiple U.S. suppliers under a commercial teaming agreement to design, develop and manufacture defense articles to meet a foreign government's requirements. U.S. exporters seeking such authorization must provide detailed information concerning the scope of the project, including other exporters, U.S. subcontractors, and planned exports (including re-exports) of defense articles, defense services, and technical data, and meet the other requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
