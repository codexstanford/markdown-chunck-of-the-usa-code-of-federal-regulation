####### Violations Identified Subsequent to Obligation.

(c)The foregoing procedures provide for a determination before funds are obligated. If, however, subsequent to an obligation of funds an assistance recipient or a key individual of such recipient is found to have been convicted of a narcotics offense or to have been engaged in drug trafficking (e.g., the head of a recipient entity changes during the course of an activity and the new head is found to have been engaged in drug trafficking), appropriate action should be taken, including, if necessary, termination of the assistance. Agreements shall be written to permit termination of assistance in such circumstances.
