###### Calculation of commodity prices which involve transportation costs.

(b)(1) In testing the purchase price which includes transportation cost (customarily known as a c. & f. or c.i.f. price) for compliance with the requirements of ยง 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), USAID will subtract transportation cost as calculated by reference to the freight rate, for the type and flag of vessel on which the commodity was shipped, prevailing on the date the purchase price is fixed. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the actual transportation cost paid by the supplier shall be presumed to be the transportation cost calculated in accordance with the formula contained in the foregoing sentence.

(2) In testing a purchase price involving transportation cost for compliance with ยง 201.62 and ยง 201.63(b), the test or measurement prices shall be:

(i) Prices based upon transportation by a U.S.-flag vessel if the price tested involves transportation by such vessel; or

(ii) Prices based upon transportation by either a U.S.-flag or a foreign-flag vessel, whichever is lower, if the price tested involves transportation by a foreign-flag vessel.
