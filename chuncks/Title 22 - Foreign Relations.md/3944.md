#### ยง 211.6 Processing, repackaging, and labeling commodities.
##### Commercial processing and repackaging.

(a)Cooperating sponsors or their designees may arrange for processing commodities into different end products and for packaging or repackaging commodities prior to distribution. Commodities may be bartered, or monetized proceeds or program income may be used, to offset such costs if provided for in the Operational Plan or TA or approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post.

Except as AID/W otherwise agrees, the executed agreements shall provide as a minimum that the party providing such services shall:

(1) Fully account to the cooperating sponsor for all commodities delivered to the processor's possession and shall maintain adequate records and submit periodic reports pertaining to the performance of the agreement;

(2) Be liable for the value of all commodities not accounted for as provided in ยง 211.9(e);

(3) Return or dispose of the containers in which the commodity is received from the cooperating sponsor according to instructions from the cooperating sponsor; and

(4) Plainly label carton, sacks, or other containers containing the end product in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
