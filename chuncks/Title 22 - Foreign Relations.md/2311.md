####### Control.

(a)Articles are controlled on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) because they are either:

(1) Enumerated in a category; or

(2) Described in a catch-all paragraph that incorporates specially designed as a control parameter. In order to classify an item on the USML, begin with a review of the general characteristics of the item. This should guide you to the appropriate category, whereupon you should attempt to match the particular characteristics and functions of the article to a specific entry within that category.
