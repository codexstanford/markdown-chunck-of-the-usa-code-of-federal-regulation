###### Calculation of commodity prices on a common basis.

(a)In testing whether the purchase price of a commodity exceeds the price in comparable export sales or in comparable domestic sales, as applicable under ยง 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), it is necessary to insure that the price being tested as well as the prices being used as a test or measurement are calculated on the basis of delivery alongside or on board the vessel or other export conveyance. Such prices will include, therefore, in addition to the price of the commodity at an internal point in the source country, transportation from that point to the port of export in the source country, and to the extent not already included in the price at the internal point, inspection, export packing, forwarder's fees at customary rates, the cost of placing the commodities on board the vessel or export conveyance (unless this cost is covered in the export freight), and other necessary costs customary in the trade.
