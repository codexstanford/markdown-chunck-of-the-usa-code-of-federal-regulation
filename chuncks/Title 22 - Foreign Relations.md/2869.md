(ii) Beenin drug trafficking, regardless of whether there has been a conviction.

(2) Factors that may support a decision to withhold assistance or take other measures based on reason to believe that the proposed recipient has been engaged in drug trafficking activities within the past ten years when there has been no conviction of such an offense may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Admission of participation in such activities;

(ii) A long record of arrests for drug trafficking activities with an unexplained failure to prosecute by the local government;

(iii) Adequate reliable information indicating involvement in drug trafficking.

(3) If the Country Narcotics Coordinator knows or has reason to believe that a key individual (as described in ยง 140.6(a)(3)) within a proposed recipient entity has been convicted of a narcotics offense or has been engaged in drug trafficking under the terms of this part, the Country Narcotics Coordinator must then decide whether withholding assistance from the entity or taking other measures to structure the provision of assistance to meet the requirements of section 487 is warranted. This decision shall be made in consultation with the agency proposing the assistance and other appropriate bureaus and agencies. In making this determination, the Country Narcotics Coordinator shall take into account:

(i) The extent to which such individual would have control over assistance received;

(ii) The extent to which such individual could benefit personally from the assistance;

(iii) Whether such individual has acted alone or in collaboration with others associated with the entity;

(iv) The degree to which financial or other resources of the entity itself have been used to support drug trafficking; and

(v) Whether the provision of assistance to the entity can be structured in such a way as to exclude from the effective control or benefit of the assistance any key individuals with respect to whom a negative determination has been made.
