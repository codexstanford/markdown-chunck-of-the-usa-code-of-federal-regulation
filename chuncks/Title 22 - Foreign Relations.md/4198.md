###### When deductions may begin.

(k)(1) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will begin on the date stated in the Agency's written demand-for-payment notice of intention to collect, from the employee's current pay unless he or she has paid the debt or filed a timely request for a hearing on issues for which a hearing is appropriate.

(2) If the employee has filed a timely request for hearing with the Agency, deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a final written decision indicating the amount owed the Government. Following the decision by the hearing official, the employee will be given 30 days to repay the amount owed prior to collection through salary offset, unless otherwise provided by the hearing official.
