(b)A recipient to which this subpart applies that provides personal, academic or vocational counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap.

This requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factural information about licensing and certification requirements that may present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular careers.
