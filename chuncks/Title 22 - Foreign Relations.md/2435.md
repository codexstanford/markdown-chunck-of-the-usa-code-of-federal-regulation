##### ยง 123.4 Temporary import license exemptions.

(a) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the temporary import (and subsequent export) without a license, for a period of up to 4 years, of unclassified U.S.-origin defense items (including any items manufactured abroad pursuant to U.S. Government approval) if the item temporarily imported:

(1) Is serviced (e.g., inspection, testing, calibration or repair, including overhaul, reconditioning and one-to-one replacement of any defective items, parts or components, but excluding any modifications, enhancement, upgrade or other form of alteration or improvement that changes the basic performance of the item), and is subsequently returned to the country from which it was imported. Shipment may be made by the U.S. importer or a foreign government representative of the country from which the goods were imported; or

(2) Is to be enhanced, upgraded or incorporated into another item which has already been authorized by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for permanent export; or

(3) Is imported for the purpose of exhibition, demonstration or marketing in the United States and is subsequently returned to the country from which it was imported; or

(4) Has been rejected for permanent import by the Department of Justice and is being returned to the country from which it was shipped; or

(5) Is approved for such import under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program pursuant to an executed U.S. Department of Defense Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA).

(b) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the temporary import (but not the subsequent export) without a license of unclassified defense articles that are to be incorporated into another article, or modified, enhanced, upgraded, altered, improved or serviced in any other manner that changes the basic performance or productivity of the article prior to being returned to the country from which they were shipped or prior to being shipped to a third country. A DSP-5 is required for the reexport of such unclassified defense articles after incorporation into another article, modification, enhancement, upgrading, alteration or improvement.
