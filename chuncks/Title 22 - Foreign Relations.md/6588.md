#### ยง 1002.7 Fees.
##### Advance payment and deposits.

(a)When the amount of a fee can be readily computed (as, for example, when a specified number of copy pages are requested) advance payment will be required. When the amount cannot be readily computed (as, for example, when an unknown amount of stafftime must be used in complying with a request), the General Counsel may require payment of a reasonable deposit before undertaking to collect the requested records. At the earliest practicable time, the General Counsel will determine the full amount of the fee and, before complying fully with the request, will require payment of any balance due or refund any overpayment.
