####### Use of third parties.

(4)A sponsor may engage a third party (including, but not limited to a host organization, partner, local business, governmental entity, academic institution, or any other foreign or domestic agent) to assist it in the conduct of its designated student internship program. Such a third party must have an executed written agreement with the sponsor to act on behalf of the sponsor in the conduct of the sponsor's program. This agreement must outline the full relationship between the sponsor and third party on all matters involving the administration of its exchange visitor program. A sponsor's use of a third party does not relieve the sponsor of its obligations to comply with and to ensure third party compliance with Exchange Visitor Program regulations. Any failure by any third party to comply with the regulations set forth in this part or with any additional terms and conditions governing Exchange Visitor Program administration that the Department may from time to time impose will be imputed to the sponsor.
