####### Verification of blade edge thickness.

(4)DOE will measure the blade edge thickness and round the measurement pursuant to the test requirements of 10 CFR part 430 for each unit tested. DOE will consider the represented blade edge thickness valid only if the measurement(s) (either the measured value for a single unit, or the mean of the measured values for a multiple unit sample, rounded to the nearest 0.01 inch) are the same as the represented blade edge thickness.

(i) If DOE determines that the represented blade edge thickness is valid, that blade edge thickness will be used for determining product class.

(ii) If DOE determines that the represented blade edge thickness is invalid, DOE will use the rounded measured blade edge thickness(es) as the basis for determining the product class.
