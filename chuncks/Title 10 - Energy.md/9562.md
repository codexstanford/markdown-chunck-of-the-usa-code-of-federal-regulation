Evaluate the quantities(47) and(47) according to section 3.7 of this appendix.

Otherwise (if no high temperature test is conducted using the same speed (RPM or power input frequency) as the H3test), calculate the 47 &#xB0;F capacity and power input values used for calculation of HSPF2 as follows:

CSF is the capacity slope factor, equal to 0.0204/ &#xB0;F for split systems, and

PSF is the Power Slope Factor, equal to 0.00455/ &#xB0;F.
