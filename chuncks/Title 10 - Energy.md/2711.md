(b) Any license may be revoked, suspended, or modified, in whole or in part, for any material false statement in the application or any statement of fact required under section 182 of the Act, or because of conditions revealed by such application or statement of fact or any report, record, or inspection or other means which would warrant the Commission to refuse to grant a license on an original application, or for violation of, or failure to observe any of, the terms and conditions of the Act, or the license, or of any rule, regulation or order of the Commission.
