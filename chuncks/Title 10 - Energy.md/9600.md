For coil-only split systems and blower coil split systems for which a furnace or a modular blower is the designated air mover, subtract the low-voltage power () from the heating season total off mode power (2) and divide by the number of compressors to calculatethe heating season per-compressor off mode power. Round to the nearest watt. The expression for calculatingis as follows:

Calculate SEER2 as follows: For equipment covered under sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4 of this appendix, evaluate the seasonal energy efficiency ratio,

Additionally, for sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4 of this appendix, use a building cooling load, BL(T). When referenced, evaluate BL(T) for cooling using,

a. Evaluate the seasonal energy efficiency ratio, expressed in units of Btu/watt-hour, using:
