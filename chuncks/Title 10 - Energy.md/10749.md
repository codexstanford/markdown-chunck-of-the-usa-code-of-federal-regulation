####### ยง 431.76 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial warm air furnaces.
######## Adjustment to the thermal efficiency for condensing furnaces.

(2)You must adjust the thermal efficiency as calculated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by adding the latent gain, expressed in percent, from the condensation of the water vapor in the flue gas, and subtracting the heat loss (due to the flue condensate down the drain), also expressed in percent, both as calculated in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to obtain the thermal efficiency of a condensing furnace.
