7.5Adjust air throughputs to achieve a temperature rise that is the higher of a and b, below, unless c applies. A tolerance of +/-2 &#xB0;F is permitted.

(a) 15 &#xB0;F less than the nameplate maximum temperature rise or

(b) 15 &#xB0;F higher than the minimum temperature rise specified in the I&O manual.

(c) A furnace with a non-adjustable air temperature rise range and an automatically controlled airflow that does not permit a temperature rise range of 30 &#xB0;F or more must be tested at the midpoint of the rise range.
