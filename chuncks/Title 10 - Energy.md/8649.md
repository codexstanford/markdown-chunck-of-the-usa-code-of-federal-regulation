####### Hourly Btu Rating.

2.3.2.3Maintain the hourly Btu rating of the burner within +/-5 percent of the rating specified by the manufacturer. If the hourly Btu rating of the burner cannot be maintained within +/-5 percent of the rating specified by the manufacturer, make adjustments in the following order until an hourly Btu rating of the burner within +/-5 percent of the rating specified by the manufacturer is achieved:

(1) Modify the gas inlet supply pressure within the allowable range specified in section 2.3.2.1 or 2.3.2.2 of this appendix, as applicable;

(2) If the clothes dryer is equipped with a gas pressure regulator, modify the outlet pressure of the gas pressure regulator within +/-10 percent of the value recommended by the manufacturer in the installation manual, on the nameplate sticker, or wherever the manufacturer makes such a recommendation for the basic model; and

(3) Modify the orifice as necessary to achieve the required hourly Btu rating.
