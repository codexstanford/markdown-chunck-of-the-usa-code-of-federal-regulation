### PART 52 - LICENSES, CERTIFICATIONS, AND APPROVALS FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS
#### Appendix C to Part 52 - Design Certification Rule for the AP600 Design
##### Tier 2*

F.means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some Tier 2* information under Section VIII.B.6.

G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses means:

(1) Changing any of the elements of the method described in the plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative or essentially the same; or

(2) Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to another method unless that method has been approved by NRC for the intended application.

H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 CFR 50.2 or 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as applicable.

A. Tier 1, Tier 2 (including the investment protection short-term availability controls in Section 16.3), and the generic technical specifications in the AP600 DCD (12/99 revision) are approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register on January 24, 2000, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of the generic DCD may be obtained from Ronald P. Vijuk, Manager, Passive Plant Engineering, Westinghouse Electric Company, P.O. Box 355, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15230-0355. A copy of the generic DCD is available for examination and copying at the NRC Public Document Room located at One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland 20852. Copies are also available for examination at the NRC Library located at Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852; and the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC.

B. An applicant or licensee referencing this appendix, in accordance with Section IV of this appendix, shall incorporate by reference and comply with the requirements of this appendix, including Tier 1, Tier 2 (including the investment protection short-term availability controls in Section 16.3), and the generic technical specifications except as otherwise provided in this appendix. Conceptual design information in the generic DCD and the evaluation of severe accident mitigation design alternatives in Appendix 1B of the generic DCD are not part of this appendix.

C. If there is a conflict between Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the DCD, then Tier 1 controls.

D. If there is a conflict between the generic DCD and either the application for design certification of the AP600 design or NUREG-1512, "Final Safety Evaluation Report Related to Certification of the AP600 Standard Design," (FSER), then the generic DCD controls.

E. Design activities for structures, systems, and components that are wholly outside the scope of this appendix may be performed using site characteristics, provided the design activities do not affect the DCD or conflict with the interface requirements.

A. An applicant for a combined license that wishes to reference this appendix shall, in addition to complying with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.77, 52.79, and 52.80, comply with the following requirements:

1. Incorporate by reference, as part of its application, this appendix;

2. Include, as part of its application:

a. A plant-specific DCD containing the same type of information and utilizing the same organization and numbering as the generic DCD for the AP600 design, as modified and supplemented by the applicant's exemptions and departures;

b. The reports on departures from and updates to the plant-specific DCD required by paragraph X.B of this appendix;

c. Plant-specific technical specifications, consisting of the generic and site-specific technical specifications, that are required by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a;

d. Information demonstrating compliance with the site parameters and interface requirements;

e. Information that addresses the COL action items; and

f. Information required by 10 CFR 52.47 that is not within the scope of this appendix.

3. Include, in the plant-specific DCD, the proprietary information and safeguards information referenced in the AP600 DCD.

B. The Commission reserves the right to determine in what manner this appendix may be referenced by an applicant for a construction permit or operating license under 10 CFR part 50.

A. Except as indicated in paragraph B of this section, the regulations that apply to the AP600 design are in 10 CFR parts 20, 50, 73, and 100, codified as of December 16, 1999, that are applicable and technically relevant, as described in the FSER (NUREG-1512) and the supplementary information for this section.

B. The AP600 design is exempt from portions of the following regulations:

1. Paragraph (a)(1) of 10 CFR 50.34-whole body dose criterion;

2. Paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of 10 CFR 50.34-Plant Safety Parameter Display Console;

3. Paragraphs (f)(2)(vii), (viii), (xxvi), and (xxviii) of 10 CFR 50.34-Accident Source Term in TID 14844;

4. Paragraph (a)(2) of 10 CFR 50.55a-ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code;

5. Paragraph (c)(1) of 10 CFR 50.62-Auxiliary (or emergency) feedwater system;

6. Appendix A to 10 CFR part 50, GDC 17-Offsite Power Sources; and

A. The Commission has determined that the structures, systems, components, and design features of the AP600 design comply with the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the applicable regulations identified in Section V of this appendix; and therefore, provide adequate protection to the health and safety of the public. A conclusion that a matter is resolved includes the finding that additional or alternative structures, systems, components, design features, design criteria, testing, analyses, acceptance criteria, or justifications are not necessary for the AP600 design.

B. The Commission considers the following matters resolved within the meaning of 10 CFR 52.63(a)(5) in subsequent proceedings for issuance of a combined license, amendment of a combined license, or renewal of a combined license, proceedings held under 10 CFR 52.103, and enforcement proceedings involving plants referencing this appendix:
