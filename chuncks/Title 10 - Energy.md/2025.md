######### § 31.5 Certain detecting, measuring, gauging, or controlling devices and certain devices for producing light or an ionized atmosphere.

(a) A general license is hereby issued to commercial and industrial firms and research, educational and medical institutions, individuals in the conduct of their business, and Federal, State or local government agencies to acquire, receive, possess, use or transfer, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, byproduct material contained in devices designed and manufactured for the purpose of detecting, measuring, gauging or controlling thickness, density, level, interface location, radiation, leakage, or qualitative or quantitative chemical composition, or for producing light or an ionized atmosphere.

(b)(1) The general license in paragraph (a) of this section applies only to byproduct material contained in devices which have been manufactured or initially transferred and labeled in accordance with the specifications contained in-

(i) A specific license issued under § 32.51 of this chapter; or

(ii) An equivalent specific license issued by an Agreement State; or

(iii) An equivalent specific license issued by a State with provisions comparable to § 32.51 of this chapter.

(2) The devices must have been received from one of the specific licensees described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or through a transfer made under paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

(c) Any person who acquires, receives, possesses, uses or transfers byproduct material in a device pursuant to the general license in paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) Shall assure that all labels affixed to the device at the time of receipt and bearing a statement that removal of the label is prohibited are maintained thereon and shall comply with all instructions and precautions provided by such labels;

(2) Shall assure that the device is tested for leakage of radioactive material and proper operation of the on-off mechanism and indicator, if any, at no longer than six-month intervals or at such other intervals as are specified in the label; however:

(i) Devices containing only krypton need not be tested for leakage of radioactive material, and

(ii) Devices containing only tritium or not more than 100 microcuries of other beta and/or gamma emitting material or 10 microcuries of alpha emitting material and devices held in storage in the original shipping container prior to initial installation need not be tested for any purpose;

(3) Shall assure that the tests required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section and other testing, installation, servicing, and removal from installation involving the radioactive materials, its shielding or containment, are performed:

(i) In accordance with the instructions provided by the labels; or

(ii) By a person holding a specific license pursuant to parts 30 and 32 of this chapter or from an Agreement State to perform such activities;

(4) Shall maintain records showing compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. The records must show the results of tests. The records also must show the dates of performance of, and the names of persons performing, testing, installing, servicing, and removing from the installation radioactive material and its shielding or containment. The licensee shall retain these records as follows:

(i) Each record of a test for leakage or radioactive material required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be retained for three years after the next required leak test is performed or until the sealed source is transferred or disposed of.

(ii) Each record of a test of the on-off mechanism and indicator required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be retained for three years after the next required test of the on-off mechanism and indicator is performed or until the sealed source is transferred or disposed of.

(iii) Each record that is required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section must be retained for three years from the date of the recorded event or until the device is transferred or disposed of.

(5) Shall immediately suspend operation of the device if there is a failure of, or damage to, or any indication of a possible failure of or damage to, the shielding of the radioactive material or the on-off mechanism or indicator, or upon the detection of 185 bequerel (0.005 microcurie) or more removable radioactive material. The device may not be operated until it has been repaired by the manufacturer or other person holding a specific license to repair such devices that was issued under parts 30 and 32 of this chapter or by an Agreement State. The device and any radioactive material from the device may only be disposed of by transfer to a person authorized by a specific license to receive the byproduct material in the device or as otherwise approved by the Commission. A report containing a brief description of the event and the remedial action taken; and, in the case of detection of 0.005 microcurie or more removable radioactive material or failure of or damage to a source likely to result in contamination of the premises or the environs, a plan for ensuring that the premises and environs are acceptable for unrestricted use, must be furnished to the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, ATTN: GLTS, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001 within 30 days. Under these circumstances, the criteria set out in § 20.1402 of this chapter, "Radiological criteria for unrestricted use," may be applicable, as determined by the Commission on a case-by-case basis;

(6) Shall not abandon the device containing byproduct material;

(7) Shall not export the device containing byproduct material except in accordance with part 110 of this chapter;

(8)(i) Shall transfer or dispose of the device containing byproduct material only by export as provided by paragraph (c)(7) of this section, by transfer to another general licensee as authorized in paragraph (c)(9) of this section, or to a person authorized to receive the device by a specific license issued under parts 30 and 32 of this chapter, or part 30 of this chapter that authorizes waste collection, or equivalent regulations of an Agreement State, or as otherwise approved under paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section.

(ii) Shall, within 30 days after the transfer of a device to a specific licensee or export, furnish a report to the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards , ATTN: Document Control Desk/GLTS, using an appropriate method listed in § 30.6(a) of this chapter. The report must contain-

(A) The identification of the device by manufacturer's (or initial transferor's) name, model number, and serial number;

(B) The name, address, and license number of the person receiving the device (license number not applicable if exported); and

(C) The date of the transfer.

(iii) Shall obtain written NRC approval before transferring the device to any other specific licensee not specifically identified in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section; however, a holder of a specific license may transfer a device for possession and use under its own specific license without prior approval, if, the holder:

(A) Verifies that the specific license authorizes the possession and use, or applies for and obtains an amendment to the license authorizing the possession and use;

(B) Removes, alters, covers, or clearly and unambiguously augments the existing label (otherwise required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section) so that the device is labeled in compliance with § 20.1904 of this chapter; however the manufacturer, model number, and serial number must be retained;
