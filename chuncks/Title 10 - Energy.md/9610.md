For variable-speed non-communicating coil-only heat pumps, when Tis greater than or equal to 47 &#xB0;F, evaluate the space heating capacity,(T), and electrical power consumption,(T), of the heat pump when operating at minimum compressor speed as described in Equations 4.2.4-1 and 4.2.4-2 to this appendix, respectively. When Tis less than 47 &#xB0;F, evaluate the space heating capacity,(T), and electrical power consumption,(T) using:
