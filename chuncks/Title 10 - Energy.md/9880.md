###### 2.6.1 Gas-fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct vent systems).

Install thermocouples for measuring the heated air temperature as described in Section 11.7.5 of ANSI Z21.86-2016. Establish the temperature of the inlet air by means of a single No. 24 AWG bead-type thermocouple located in the center of the plane of each inlet air opening. Use bead-type thermocouples having wire size not greater than No. 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG). If a thermocouple has a direct line of sight with the fire, install a radiation shield, meeting the material and minimum thickness requirements from Section 8.14.1 of ANSI Z21.86-2016, on the fire side of the thermocouple only, and position the shield so that it does not touch the thermocouple junction.
