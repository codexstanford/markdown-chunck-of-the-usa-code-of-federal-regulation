###### Appendix B to Subpart B of Part 431 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Efficiency of Electric Motors

For any other electric motor that is not currently covered by the energy conservation standards at ยง 431.25, manufacturers of this equipment must test in accordance with this appendix 180 days after the effective date of the final rule adopting energy conservation standards for such motor. For any other electric motor that is not currently covered by the energy conservation standards at ยง 431.25, manufacturers choosing to make any representations respecting of energy efficiency for such motors must test in accordance with this appendix.

In ยง 431.15, DOE incorporated by reference the entire standard for CSA C390-10, CSA C747-09, IEC 60034-1:2010, IEC 60034-2-1:2014, IEC 60051-1:2016, IEC 61800-9-2:2017, IEEE 112-2017, IEEE 114-2010, and NEMA MG 1-2016; however, only enumerated provisions of those documents are applicable as follows. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of this appendix takes precedence over those documents. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by the standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until the test procedure is amended by DOE.
