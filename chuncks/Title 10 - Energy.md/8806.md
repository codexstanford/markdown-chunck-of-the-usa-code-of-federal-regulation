###### Appendix E to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Water Heaters
####### 5.3.2 Maximum GPM Rating Test for Flow-Activated Water Heaters.

Establish normal water heater operation at the full input rate for electric water heaters and at the maximum firing rate for gas or oil water heaters with the discharge water temperature set in accordance with section 5.2.2.1 of this appendix.

For this 10-minute test, either collect the withdrawn water for later measurement of the total mass removed or use a water meter to directly measure the water volume removed. Initiate water flow through the water heater and record the inlet and outlet water temperatures beginning 15 seconds after the start of the test and at subsequent 5-second intervals throughout the duration of the test. At the end of 10 minutes, turn off the water. Determine and record the mass of water collected, M, in pounds (kilograms), or the volume of water, V, in gallons (liters).
