###### Twenty-four hour report.

(c)The Corporation shall notify the NRC Operations Center within 24 hours after the discovery of any of the following events involving radioactive material:

(1) An unplanned contamination event that:

(i) Requires access to the contaminated area, by workers or the public, to be restricted for more than 24 hours by imposing additional radiological controls or by prohibiting entry into the area;

(ii) Involves a quantity of material greater than five times the lowest annual limit on intake specified in appendix B to §§ 20.1001 through 20.2402 of 10 CFR part 20 for the material; and

(iii) Causes access to the contaminated area to be restricted for any reason other than to allow isotopes with a half-life of less than 24 hours to decay prior to decontamination.

(2) An event in which equipment is disabled or fails to function as designed when:

(i) The equipment is required by a Technical Safety Requirement to prevent releases, prevent exposures to radiation and radioactive materials exceeding specified limits, mitigate the consequences of an accident, or restore this facility to a preestablished safe condition after an accident;

(ii) The equipment is required by a Technical Safety Requirement to be available and operable and either should have been operating or should have operated on demand; and

(iii) No redundant equipment is available and operable to perform the required safety function.

(3) An event that requires unplanned medical treatment at a medical facility of an individual with radioactive contamination on the individual's clothing or body.

(4) A fire or explosion damaging any radioactive material or any device, container, or equipment containing radioactive material when:

(i) The quantity of material involved is greater than five times the lowest annual limit on intake specified in appendix B to §§ 20.1001 through 20.2402 of 10 CFR part 20 for the material; and

(ii) The damage affects the integrity of the radioactive material or its container.
