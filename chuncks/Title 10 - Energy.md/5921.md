##### ยง 74.33 Nuclear material control and accounting for uranium enrichment facilities authorized to produce special nuclear material of low strategic significance.
###### System features and capabilities.

(c)To meet the general performance objectives of paragraph (a) of this section, the Material Control and Accounting (MC&A) system must include the features and capabilities described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (8) of this section. The licensee shall establish, document, and maintain:

(1) A management structure that ensures:

(i) Clear overall responsibility for MC&A functions;

(ii) Independence of MC&A management from production responsibilities;

(iii) Separation of key MC&A responsibilities from each other; and

(iv) Use of approved written MC&A procedures and periodic review of those procedures;

(2) A measurement program that ensures that all quantities of source material and special nuclear material in the accounting records are based on measured values;

(3) A measurement control program that ensures that:

(i) Measurement bias is estimated and minimized through the measurement control program, and any significant biases are eliminated from inventory difference values of record;

(ii) All MC&A measurement systems are controlled so that twice the standard error of the inventory difference, based on all measurement error contributions, is less than the greater of 5,000 grams of Uor 0.25 percent of the Uof the active inventory for each total plant material balance; and

(iii) Any measurements performed under contract are controlled so that the licensee can satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section;

(4) A physical inventory program that provides for:

(i) Performing, unless otherwise required to satisfy part 75 of this chapter, a dynamic (nonshutdown) physical inventory of in-process (e.g., in the enrichment equipment) uranium and Uat least every 65 days, and performing a static physical inventory of all other uranium and total Ucontained in natural, depleted, and enriched uranium located outside of the enrichment processing equipment at least every 370 calendar days, with static physical inventories being conducted in conjunction with a dynamic physical inventory of in-process uranium and Uso as to provide a total plant material balance at least every 370 calendar days; and

(ii) Reconciling and adjusting the book inventory to the results of the static physical inventory and resolving, or reporting an inability to resolve, any inventory difference that is rejected by a statistical test which has a 90 percent power of detecting a discrepancy of a quantity of U, established by NRC on a site-specific basis, within 60 days after the start of each static physical inventory;

(5) A detection program, independent of production, that provides high assurance of detecting:

(i) Production of uranium enriched to 10 percent or more in the Uisotope, to the extent that SNM of moderate strategic significance could be produced within any 370 calendar day period;

(ii) Production of uranium enriched to 20 percent or more in the Uisotope; and

(iii) Unauthorized production of uranium of low strategic significance;

(6) An item control program that ensures that:

(i) Current knowledge is maintained of items with respect to identity, uranium and Ucontent, and stored location; and

(ii) Items are stored and handled, or subsequently measured, in a manner so that unauthorized removal of 500 grams or more of U, as individual items or as uranium contained in items, will be detected. Exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) (i) and (ii) of this section are licensed-identified items each containing less than 500 grams Uup to a cumulative total of 50 kilograms of Uand items that exist for less than 14 calendar days;

(7) A resolution program that ensures that any shipper-receiver differences are resolved that are statistically significant and exceed 500 grams Uon:

(i) An individual batch basis; and

(ii) A total shipment basis for all source material and special nuclear material;

(8) An assessment program that:

(i) Independently assesses the effectiveness of the MC&A system at least every 24 months;

(ii) Documents the results of the above assessment;

(iii) Documents management's findings on whether the MC&A system is currently effective; and

(iv) Documents any actions taken on recommendations from prior assessments.
