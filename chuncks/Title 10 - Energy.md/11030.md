###### Appendix A to Subpart G of Part 431 - Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Thermal Efficiency and Standby Loss of Gas-Fired and Oil-Fired Storage Water Heaters and Storage-Type Instantaneous Water Heaters
####### 6.

7.1. The standby loss expressed as a percentage (per hour) of the heat content of the stored water above room temperature must be calculated using the following equation:

6.7.2. The standby loss expressed in Btu per hour must be calculated as follows:

SL (Btu per hour) = S (% per hour) x 8.25 (Btu/gal- &#xB0;F) x Measured Volume (gal) x 70 ( &#xB0;F).

Where, SL refers to the standby loss of the water heater, defined as the amount of energy required to maintain the stored water temperature expressed in Btu per hour
