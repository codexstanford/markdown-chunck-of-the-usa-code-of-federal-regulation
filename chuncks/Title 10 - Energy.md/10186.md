###### Relative humidity instrumentation.

3.1.1.2A relative humidity sensor with an accuracy within 1 percent relative humidity may be used in place of an aspirating psychrometer. When using a relative humidity sensor for testing, disregard the wet-bulb test tolerances in Table 1 of ANSI/AHAM DH-1 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3), the average relative humidity over the test period must be within 2 percent of the relative humidity setpoint, and all individual relative humidity readings must be within 5 percent of the relative humidity setpoint. When using a relative humidity sensor instead of an aspirating psychrometer, use a dry-bulb temperature sensor that meets the accuracy as required in section 4.1 of ANSI/AHAM DH-1.
