##### § 50.66 Requirements for thermal annealing of the reactor pressure vessel.
###### Procedures for Determining the Recovery of Fracture Toughness.

(e)The procedures of this paragraph must be used to determine the percent recovery of ΔRT, R, and percent recovery of Charpy upper-shelf energy, R. In all cases, Rand Rmay not exceed 100.

(1) For those reactors with surveillance programs which have developed credible surveillance data as defined in § 50.61, percent recovery due to thermal annealing (Rand R) must be evaluated by testing surveillance specimens that have been withdrawn from the surveillance program and that have been annealed under the same time and temperature conditions as those given the beltline material.

(2) Alternatively, the percent recovery due to thermal annealing (Rand R) may be determined from the results of a verification test program employing materials removed from the beltline region of the reactor vesseland that have been annealed under the same time and temperature conditions as those given the beltline material.

(3) Generic computational methods may be used to determine recovery if adequate justification is provided.
