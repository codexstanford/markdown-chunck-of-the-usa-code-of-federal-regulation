####### Per-cycle energy consumption for removal of moisture from test load.

4.3Calculate the per-cycle energy required to remove the remaining moisture of the test load, D, expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle and defined as:

D= [(Fx Maximum test load weight) + (Fx Average test load weight) + (Fx Minimum test load weight)] x (RMC- 4%) x (DEF) x (DUF)

F, F, and Fare defined in Table 4.1.3 of this appendix.

Maximum, average, and minimum test load weights are defined in Table 5.1 of this appendix.
