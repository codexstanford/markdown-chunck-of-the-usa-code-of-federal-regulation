(B) In Equation 5, "n" is the number of surveillance data points, "A" is the measured value of ΔRTand "f" is the fluence for each surveillance data point. If there is clear evidence that the copper and nickel content of the surveillance weld differs from the vessel weld,, differs from the average for the weld wire heat number associated with the vessel weld and the surveillance weld, the measured values of ΔRTmust be adjusted for differences in copper and nickel content by multiplying them by the ratio of the chemistry factor for the vessel material to that for the surveillance weld.

(iii) For cases in which the results from a credible plant-specific surveillance program are used, the value of &#x3C3;to be used is 14 &#xB0;F for welds and 8.5 &#xB0;F for base metal; the value of &#x3C3;need not exceed one-half of ΔRT.

(iv) The use of results from the plant-specific surveillance program may result in an RTthat is higher or lower than those determined in paragraph (c)(1).

(3) Any information that is believed to improve the accuracy of the RTvalue significantly must be reported to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. Any value of RTthat has been modified using the procedures of paragraph (c)(2) of this section is subject to the approval of the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, when used as provided in this section.
