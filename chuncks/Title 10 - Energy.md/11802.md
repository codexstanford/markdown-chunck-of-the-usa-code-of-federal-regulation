D.3 Calculations and Rounding. Normalize all measured data to the nominal speed of rotation of 3,600 or 1,800 rpm based on the nominal speed of rotation selected for the pump in section I.C.1 of this appendix, in accordance with the procedures specified in section 40.6.6.1.1 of HI 40.6-2014 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463). Except for the "expected BEP flow rate," all terms and quantities refer to values determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this appendix for the rated pump. Perform all calculations using raw measured values without rounding. Round PERand PERto three significant digits, and round PEI, and PEIvalues, as applicable, to the hundredths place (0.01).

D.4 Pumps with BEP at Run Out.
