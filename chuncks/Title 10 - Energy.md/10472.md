###### Fuel supply, gas.

7.1In conducting the tests specified herein, gases with characteristics as shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall be used. Maintain the gas supply, ahead of all controls for a boiler, at a test pressure between the normal and increased values shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Maintain the regulator outlet pressure at a level approximating that recommended in the I&O manual, as defined in section 2.5 of this appendix, or, in the absence of such recommendation, to the regulator settings used when the product is shipped by the manufacturer. Use a gas having a specific gravity of approximately that shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 and with a higher heating value within +/-5% of the higher heating value shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot of gas (defined in section 2 of this appendix) to be used in the test within an error no greater than 1%.
