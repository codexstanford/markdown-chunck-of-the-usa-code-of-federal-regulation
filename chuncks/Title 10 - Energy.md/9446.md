Case 1. For outdoor bin temperatures where T(T) is equal to or greater than T(the maximum supply temperature determined according to section 3.1.10 of this appendix), determine Q(T) and E(T) as specified in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (Q(T) = Q(T) and E(T) = E(T)). Note: Even though T(T) ≥Tresistive heating may be required; evaluate Equation 4.2.1-2 for all bins.

Case 2. For outdoor bin temperatures where T(T) < T, determine Q(T) and E(T) using,

Calculate the space heating capacity and electrical power of the heat pump without the heat comfort controller being active as specified in section 4.2.3 of this appendix for both high and low capacity and at each outdoor bin temperature, T, that is listed in Table 20. Denote these capacities and electrical powers by using the subscript "hp" instead of "h." For the low capacity case, calculate the mass flow rate (expressed in pounds-mass of dry air per hour) and the specific heat of the indoor air (expressed in Btu/lbm&#xB7; &#xB0;F) from the results of the H1test using:

Repeat the above calculations to determine the mass flow rate (m) and the specific heat of the indoor air (C) when operating at high capacity by using the results of the H1test. For each outdoor bin temperature listed in Table 20, calculate the nominal temperature of the air leaving the heat pump condenser coil when operating at high capacity using,

Evaluate e(T)/N, RH(T)/N, X(T), and/or X(T), PLF, and δ&#x2032;(T) or δ&#x2033;(T) as specified in section 4.2.3.1. 4.2.3.2, 4.2.3.3, or 4.2.3.4 of this appendix, whichever applies, for each temperature bin. To evaluate these quantities, use the low-capacity space heating capacity and the low-capacity electrical power from Case 1 or Case 2, whichever applies; use the high-capacity space heating capacity and the high-capacity electrical power from Case 3 or Case 4, whichever applies.
