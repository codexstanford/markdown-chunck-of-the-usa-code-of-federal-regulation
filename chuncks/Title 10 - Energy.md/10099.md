###### Test apparatus for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:

3.4.

The test apparatus and instructions for testing large-diameter ceiling fans and HSBD ceiling fans must conform to the requirements specified in Sections 3 through 7 (including Test Figure 1) of AMCA 230-15, with the following modifications:

3.4.1. A "ceiling fan" is defined as in 10 CFR 430.2.

3.4.2. Test ceiling fans rated for operation with only a single- or multi-phase power supply with single- or multi-phase electricity, respectively. Test ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity with multi-phase electricity. DOE will allow manufacturers of ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity to test such fans with single-phase power and make representations of efficiency associated with both single and multi-phase electricity if a manufacturer desires to do so, but the test results in the single-phase configuration will not be valid to assess compliance with any amended energy conservation standard. All tested power supply should be at 60 Hz.

3.4.3. Supply Voltage:

(1) For ceiling fans tested with single-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:

(a) 120 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 120 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 120 V,

(b) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or

(c) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.

(2) For ceiling fans tested with multi-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:

(a) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or

(b) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.
