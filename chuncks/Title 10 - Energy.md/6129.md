###### Limiting control settings.

(2)(i) Where a limiting control setting is specified for a variable on which a safety limit has been placed, the setting must be so chosen that protective action, either automatic or manual, will correct the abnormal situation before a safety limit is exceeded. If, during operation, the automatic alarm or protective devices do not function as required, appropriate action must be taken to maintain the variables within the limiting control-setting values and to repair promptly the automatic devices or to shut down the affected part of the process.

(ii) If, during operation, an automatic alarm or protective device does not function as required, the Corporation shall notify the Commission if required by 76.120, review the matter, and record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence.

(iii) The Corporation shall retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission no longer has certification authority.
