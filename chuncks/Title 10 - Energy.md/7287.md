###### Emission reduction and subentity statements.

(e)For each subentity, an entity must submit to EIA the following information:

(1) An identification and description of the method used to calculate emission reductions, including:

(i) The type of calculation method;

(ii) The measure of output used (if any); and

(iii) The method-specific base period for which any required base value will be calculated.

(2) The base period used in calculating reductions. When an entity starts to report, the base period used in calculating reductions must end in the start year. However, over time the reporting entity may find it necessary to revise or establish new base periods and base values in response to significant changes in processes or output of the subentity.

(3) A description of the subentity and its primary economic activity or activities, such as electricity generation, product manufacturing, service provider, freight transport, or household operation; and

(4) A description of the emission sources or sinks covered, such as fossil fuel power plants, manufacturing facilities, commercial office buildings or heavy-duty vehicles.
