###### ยง 490.804 Eligible reductions in petroleum consumption.
####### Qualified nonroad vehicles.

(b)Demonstrated reductions in petroleum consumption during the model year for which a waiver is requested that are attributable to nonroad vehicles owned, operated, leased or otherwise under the control of a State or covered person acquired during waiver years are applicable towards the petroleum fuel reduction required in ยง 490.803(a) of this subpart:

(1) If acquisition of the nonroad vehicles leads directly to the establishment or upgrading of refueling or recharging infrastructure during a waiver year that would also allow for increased petroleum replacement by serving the fleet's on-road light-duty vehicles; and

(2) To the extent that additional reductions attributable to motor vehicles are not reasonably available.
