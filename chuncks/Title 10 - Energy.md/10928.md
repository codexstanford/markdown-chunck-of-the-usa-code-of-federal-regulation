####### Critical Parameter Adjustments for Meeting Cooling Capacity Targets.,i.e.,

5.2.1Once critical parameters have been set to the values certified in the STI, if the unit cannot operate within 3% of the target cooling capacity (within 3% of the load fraction for a given part-load cooling test (75%, 50%, or 25% load) or within 3% of the certified cooling capacity for a 100% full-load cooling test), manually-controlled critical parameters must be adjusted according to the following provisions:
