####### Ceiling Fans,Verification of blade span.

(t)-(1)DOE will measure the blade span and round the measurement pursuant to the test requirements of 10 CFR part 430 of this chapter for each unit tested. DOE will consider the represented blade span valid only if the rounded measurement(s) (either the rounded measured value for a single unit, or the mean of the rounded measured values for a multiple unit sample, rounded to the nearest inch) is the same as the represented blade span.

(i) If DOE determines that the represented blade span is valid, that blade span will be used as the basis for determining the product class and calculating the minimum allowable ceiling fan efficiency.

(ii) If DOE determines that the represented blade span is invalid, DOE will use the rounded measured blade span(s) as the basis for determining the product class, and calculating the minimum allowable ceiling fan efficiency.
