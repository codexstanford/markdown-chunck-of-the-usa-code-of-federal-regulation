####### Potentially Adverse Conditions.

(c)(1) Evidence of active faulting within the geologic setting.

(2) Historical earthquakes or past man-induced seismicity that, if either were to recur, could produce ground motion at the site in excess of reasonable design limits.

(3) Evidence, based on correlations of earthquakes with tectonic processes and features, (e.g., faults) within the geologic setting, that the magnitude of earthquakes at the site during repository construction, operation, and closure may be larger then predicted from historical seismicity.
