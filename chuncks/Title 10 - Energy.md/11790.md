(6) Pumps meeting the design and construction requirements set forth in Military Specification MIL-P-17639F, "Pumps, Centrifugal, Miscellaneous Service, Naval Shipboard Use" (as amended); MIL-P-17881D, "Pumps, Centrifugal, Boiler Feed, (Multi-Stage)" (as amended); MIL-P-17840C, "Pumps, Centrifugal, Close-Coupled, Navy Standard (For Surface Ship Application)" (as amended); MIL-P-18682D, "Pump, Centrifugal, Main Condenser Circulating, Naval Shipboard" (as amended); MIL-P-18472G, "Pumps, Centrifugal, Condensate, Feed Booster, Waste Heat Boiler, And Distilling Plant" (as amended). Military specifications and standards are available for review at.

(d) The energy conservation standards in paragraph (b) of this section apply only to pumps that have the following characteristics:

(1) Flow rate of 25 gpm or greater at BEP at full impeller diameter;

(2) Maximum head of 459 feet at BEP at full impeller diameter and the number of stages required for testing;

(3) Design temperature range from 14 to 248 &#xB0;F;

(4) Designed to operate with either:

(i) A 2- or 4-pole induction motor; or

(ii) A non-induction motor with a speed of rotation operating range that includes speeds of rotation between 2,880 and 4,320 revolutions per minute and/or 1,440 and 2,160 revolutions per minute; and

(iii) In either case, the driver and impeller must rotate at the same speed;

(5) For ST pumps, a 6-inch or smaller bowl diameter; and

(6) For ESCC and ESFM pumps, specific speed less than or equal to 5,000 when calculated using U.S. customary units.

(e) For the purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, "WEF" means the weighted energy factor and "hhp" means the rated hydraulic horsepower, as determined in accordance with the test procedure in ยง 431.464(b) and applicable sampling plans in ยง 429.59 of this chapter.

(f) Each dedicated-purpose pool pump that is not a submersible pump and is manufactured starting on July 19, 2021 must have a WEF rating that is not less than the value calculated from the following table:

(g) Each integral cartridge filter pool pump and integral sand filter pool pump that is manufactured starting on July 19, 2021 must be distributed in commerce with a pool pump timer that is either integral to the pump or a separate component that is shipped with the pump.

(h) For all dedicated-purpose pool pumps distributed in commerce with freeze protection controls, the pump must be shipped with freeze protection disabled or with the following default, user-adjustable settings:

(1) The default dry-bulb air temperature setting is no greater than 40 &#xB0;F;

(2) The default run time setting shall be no greater than 1 hour (before the temperature is rechecked); and

(3) The default motor speed shall not be more thanof the maximum available speed.
