######## Automatic commercial ice makers with automatic dispensers.

(i)Allow for the continuous production and dispensing of ice throughout testing. If an automatic commercial ice maker with an automatic dispenser is not able to continuously produce and dispense ice because of certain mechanisms within the automatic commercial ice maker that prohibit the continuous production and dispensing of ice throughout testing, those mechanisms must be overridden to the minimum extent which allows for the continuous production and dispensing of ice. The automatic commercial ice maker shall have an empty internal storage bin at the beginning of the test period. Collect capacity samples according to the requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the samples shall be collected through continuous use of the dispenser rather than in the internal storage bin. The intercepted ice samples shall be obtained from a container in an external ice bin that is filled one-half full of ice and is connected to the outlet of the ice dispenser through the minimal length of conduit that can be used.
