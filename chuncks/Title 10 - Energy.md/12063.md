####### Equipment and System Sizing.

403.2.2Heating and cooling equipment and systems shall be sized to provide no more than the loads calculated in accordance with subsection 403.2.1. A single piece of equipment providing both heating and cooling must satisfy this provision for one function with the other function sized as small as possible to meet the load, within available equipment options. Exceptions are as follows:

(a) When the equipment selected is the smallest size needed to meet the load within available options of the desired equipment line.

(b) Standby equipment provided with controls and devices that allow such equipment to operate automatically only when the primary equipment is not operating.

(c) Multiple units of the same equipment type with combined capacities exceeding the design load and provided with controls that sequence or otherwise optimally control the operation of each unit based on load.
