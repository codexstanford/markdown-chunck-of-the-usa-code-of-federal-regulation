Andis the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and tis the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to this subpart); and

(3) For each basic model of ceiling fan,

(i) Any represented value of blade span, as defined in section 1.4 of appendix U to subpart B of part 430, is the mean of the blade spans measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest inch;

(ii) Any represented value of blade revolutions per minute (RPM) is the mean of the blade RPM measurements measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest RPM;

(iii) Any represented value of blade edge thickness is the mean of the blade edge thicknesses measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest 0.01 inch;

(iv) Any represented value of the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point on the fan blades is the mean of the distances measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest quarter of an inch;

(v) Any represented value of tip speed is pi multiplied by represented value of blade span divided by twelve multiplied by the represented value of RPM, rounded to the nearest foot per minute; and

(vi) Any represented value of airflow (CFM) at high speed, including the value used to determine whether a ceiling fan is a highly-decorative ceiling fan as defined in section 1.10 of appendix U to subpart B of part 430, is determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) and rounded to the nearest CFM.

(4) To determine representative values of airflow, energy use, and estimated yearly energy cost of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model, use the following provisions.

(i) Airflow. Determine the represented value for airflow by calculating the weighted-average airflow of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:

(ii) Energy Use. Determine represented value for energy use by calculating the weighted-average power consumption of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:

(iii) Estimated Yearly Energy Cost. Determine the represented value for estimated yearly energy cost of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:
