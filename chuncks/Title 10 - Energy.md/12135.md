###### ยง 434.603 Determination of the design energy use.

603.1 The Design Energy Use shall be calculated by modeling the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Use Budget, but with the design features that will be used in the final building design. The simulation tool used shall segregate the calculated energy consumption by fuel type giving an annual Design Energy Use for each fuel. The sum of the Design Energy Uses multiplied by the fuel conversion factors in Table 602.2 yields the Design Energy Use for the proposed design:

Where f, f, * * * fare the fuel conversion factors in Table 602.2.
