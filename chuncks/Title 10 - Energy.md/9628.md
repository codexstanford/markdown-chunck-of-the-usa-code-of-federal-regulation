c. Except for using the above values of(Tj),(Tj),(Tj),(Tj), C, and C(k = 2), calculate the quantities e(T)/N as specified in section 4.2.3.1 of this appendix for cases where(Tj) ≥ BL(T). For all other outdoor bin temperatures, T, calculate e(Tj)/N and RH(Tj)/N as specified in section 4.2.3.3 of this appendix if(Tj) > BL(Tj) or as specified in section 4.2.3.4 of this appendix if(Tj) &#x2264; BL(T).





For central air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of: Less than 36,000 Btu/h, determine the off mode represented value, P, with the following equation:







After calculating SEER2 according to section 4.1 of this appendix and HSPF2 according to section 4.2 of this appendix round the values off as specified per § 430.23(m) of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



The SHR is defined and calculated as follows:

Where both the total and sensible cooling capacities are determined from the same cooling mode test and calculated from data collected over the same 30-minute data collection interval.

Calculate the energy efficiency ratio using,
