##### ยง 95.53 Termination of facility clearance.

(a) If the need to use, process, store, reproduce, transmit, transport, or handle classified matter no longer exists, the facility clearance will be terminated. The licensee, certificate holder, or other person for the facility may deliver all documents and matter containing classified information to the Commission, or to a person authorized to receive them, or must destroy all classified documents and matter. In either case, the licensee, certificate holder, or other person for the facility shall submit a certification of nonpossession of classified information to the NRC Division of Security Operations within 30 days of the termination of the facility clearance.

(b) In any instance where a facility clearance has been terminated based on a determination of the CSA that further possession of classified matter by the facility would not be in the interest of the national security, the licensee, certificate holder, or other person for the facility shall, upon notice from the CSA, dispose of classified documents in a manner specified by the CSA.
