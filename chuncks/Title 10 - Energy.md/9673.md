####### Input to interrupted ignition device.

8.3For burners equipped with an interrupted ignition device, record the nameplate electric power used by the ignition device, PE, or record that PE= 0.4 kW if no nameplate power input is provided. Record the nameplate ignition device on-time interval, t, or, if the nameplate does not provide the ignition device on-time interval, measure the on-time interval with a stopwatch at the beginning of the test, starting when the burner is turned on. Set t= 0 and PE= 0 if the device on-time interval is less than or equal to 5 seconds after the burner is on.
