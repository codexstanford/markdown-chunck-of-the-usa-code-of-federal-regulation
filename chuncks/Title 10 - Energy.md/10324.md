###### i.e.,

This appendix covers the test requirements used to measure the energy consumption of external power supplies subject to the energy conservation standards set forth at ยง 430.32(w)(1). Additionally, this appendix does not apply to external power supplies for which the primary load of the converted voltage within the device is not delivered to a separate end-use product,products in which the primary load of converted voltage is delivered within the device itself to execute the primary function of the device. Examples of excluded products may include, but are not limited to, consumer electronics with USB outputs and lighting products with USB outputs.

The following definitions are for the purposes of understanding terminology associated with the test method for measuring external power supply energy consumption.
