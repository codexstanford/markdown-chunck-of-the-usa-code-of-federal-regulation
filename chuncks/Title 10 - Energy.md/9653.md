####### Condensate collection.

6.5Attach condensate drain lines to the unit as specified in the I&O manual. Maintain a continuous downward slope of drain lines from the unit. Additional precautions (such as eliminating any line configuration or position that would otherwise restrict or block the flow of condensate or checking to ensure a proper connection with condensate drain spout that allows for unobstructed flow) must be taken to facilitate uninterrupted flow of condensate during the test. Collection containers must be glass or polished stainless steel to facilitate removal of interior deposits. The collection container must have a vent opening to the atmosphere.
