3. The name, address, and telephone number, or the name and EPA identification number for the carrier transporting the waste.

The shipper of the radioactive waste shall provide the following information regarding the waste shipment on the uniform manifest:

1. The date of the waste shipment;

2. The total number of packages/disposal containers;

3. The total disposal volume and disposal weight in the shipment;

4. The total radionuclide activity in the shipment;

5. The activity of each of the radionuclides H-3, C-14, Tc-99, and I-129 contained in the shipment; and

6. The total masses of U-233, U-235, and plutonium in special nuclear material, and the total mass of uranium and thorium in source material.

The shipper of the radioactive waste shall provide the following information on the uniform manifest regarding the waste and each disposal container of waste in the shipment:

1. An alphabetic or numeric identification that uniquely identifies each disposal container in the shipment;

2. A physical description of the disposal container, including the manufacturer and model of any high integrity container;

3. The volume displaced by the disposal container;

4. The gross weight of the disposal container, including the waste;

5. For waste consigned to a disposal facility, the maximum radiation level at the surface of each disposal container;

6. A physical and chemical description of the waste;

7. The total weight percentage of chelating agent for any waste containing more than 0.1% chelating agent by weight, plus the identity of the principal chelating agent;

8. The approximate volume of waste within a container;

9. The sorbing or solidification media, if any, and the identity of the solidification media vendor and brand name;
