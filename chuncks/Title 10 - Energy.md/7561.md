###### ยง 429.35 Compact fluorescent lamps.
####### i.e.,

(ii)(A) For each basic model of integrated compact fluorescent lamp, the minimum number of units tested shall be no less than 10 units when testing for the initial lumen output, input power, initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, lifetime, CCT, CRI, power factor, and standby mode power. If more than 10 units are tested as part of the sample, the total number of units must be a multiple of 2. The same sample of units must be used as the basis for representations for initial lumen output, input power, initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, lifetime, CCT, CRI, power factor, and standby mode power. No less than three units from the same sample of units must be used when testing for the start time. Exactly six unique units (units that have not previously been tested under this paragraph (a)(1)(ii) but are representative of the same basic model tested under this paragraph (a)(1)(ii)) must be used for rapid cycle stress testing.

(B) For each basic model of non-integrated compact fluorescent lamp, the minimum number of units tested shall be no less than 10 units when testing for the initial lumen output, input power, initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, lifetime, CCT, and CRI. If more than 10 units are tested as part of the sample, the total number of units must be a multiple of 2. The same sample of units must be used as the basis for representations for initial lumen output, input power, initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, lifetime, CCT, and CRI.

(iii) For each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that:

(A) Represented values of initial lumen output, initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, CRI, power factor, or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values must be less than or equal to the lower of:
