####### Regional Annual Operating Cost-Cooling.

(4)Determine the represented value of estimated regional annual operating cost for cooling-only units or the cooling portion of the estimated regional annual operating cost for air-source heat pumps that provide both heating and cooling by calculating the product of:

(i) The value determined in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section if using appendix M to subpart B of part 430 or the value determined in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section if using appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430;

(A) The quotient of the represented value of cooling capacity, in Btu's per hour as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, divided by the represented value of SEER, in Btu's per watt-hour, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section;

(B) The quotient of the represented value of cooling capacity, in Btu's per hour as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, and multiplied by 0.93 for variable-speed heat pumps only, divided by the represented value of SEER2, in Btu's per watt-hour, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section;

(ii) The value determined in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section if using appendix M to subpart B of part 430 or the value determined in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section if using appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430;

(A) The estimated number of regional cooling load hours per year determined from Table 22 in section 4.4 of appendix M to subpart B of part 430;

(B) The estimated number of regional cooling load hours per year determined from Table 21 in section 4.4 of appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430;

(iii) A conversion factor of 0.001 kilowatts per watt; and

(iv) The representative average unit cost of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act.
