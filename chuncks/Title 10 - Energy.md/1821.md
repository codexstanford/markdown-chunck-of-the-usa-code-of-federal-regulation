###### Quality control requirements for performing initial and confirmatory validity tests on urine.

(c)(1) Requirements for performing creatinine tests:

(i) The creatinine concentration must be measured to one decimal place on both the initial and the confirmatory creatinine tests;

(ii) The initial creatinine test must have a calibrator at 2 mg/dL;

(iii) The initial creatinine test must have a control in the range of 1 to 1.5 mg/dL, a control in the range of 3 to 20 mg/dL, and a control in the range of 21 to 25 mg/dL; and

(iv) The confirmatory creatinine test (performed on those specimens with a creatinine concentration less than 2 mg/dL on the initial test) must have a calibrator at 2 mg/dL, a control in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/dL, and a control in the range of 3 to 4 mg/dL.

(2) Requirements for performing specific gravity tests:

(i) The refractometer must report and display the specific gravity to four decimal places, and must be interfaced with a laboratory information management system, or computer, and/or generate a hard copy or digital electronic display to document the numerical result;

(ii) The initial and confirmatory specific gravity tests must have a calibrator or control at 1.0000; and

(iii) The initial and confirmatory specific gravity tests must have the following controls:

(A) One control targeted at 1.0020;

(B) One control in the range of 1.0040 to 1.0180; and

(C) One control equal to or greater than 1.0200 but not greater than 1.0250.

(3) Requirements for performing pH tests:

(i) Colorimetric pH tests that have the dynamic range of 2 to 12 to support the 3 and 11 pH cutoffs and pH meters must be capable of measuring pH to one decimal place. Dipsticks, colorimetric pH tests, and pH paper that have a narrow dynamic range and do not support the 2 to 12 pH cutoffs may be used only to determine whether initial validity tests must be performed;

(ii) At a minimum, pH screening tests must have the following controls:

(A) One control below the lower decision point in use;

(B) One control between the decision points in use; and

(C) One control above the upper decision point in use;

(iii) If a pH screening test is not used, an initial pH meter test must have the following calibrators and controls:

(A) One calibrator at 4;

(B) One calibrator at 7;

(C) One calibrator at 10;

(D) One control in the range of 2 to 2.8;

(E) One control in the range of 3.2 to 4;

(F) One control in the range of 10 to 10.8; and

(G) One control in the range of 11.2 to 12;

(iv) If a pH screening test is used, an initial or confirmatory pH meter test must have the following calibrators and controls when the screening result indicates that the pH is below the lower decision point in use:

(A) One calibrator at 4;

(B) One calibrator at 7;

(C) One control in the range of 2 to 2.8; and

(D) One control in the range of 3.2 to 4;

(v) If a pH screening test is used, an initial or confirmatory pH meter test must have the following calibrators and controls when the screening result indicates that the pH is above the upper decision point in use:

(A) One calibrator at 7;

(B) One calibrator at 10;

(C) One control in the range of 10 to 10.8; and

(D) One control in the range of 11.2 to 12; and

(vi) An initial colorimetric pH test must have the following calibrators and controls:

(A) One calibrator at 3;

(B) One calibrator at 11;

(C) One control in the range of 2 to 2.8;

(D) One control in the range of 3.2 to 4;

(E) One control in the range of 4.5 to 9;

(F) One control in the range of 10 to 10.8;

(G) One control in the range of 11.2 to 12.

(4) Requirements for performing oxidizing adulterant tests:
