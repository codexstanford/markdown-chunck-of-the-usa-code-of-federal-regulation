#### ยง 1004.9 Fees for providing records.
##### Waiving or reducing fees.

(8)DOE will furnish documents without charge or at reduced charges if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. This fee waiver standard thus sets forth two basic requirements, both of which must be satisfied before fees will be waived or reduced. First it must be established that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Second, it must be established that disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. When these requirements are satisfied, based upon information supplied by a requester or otherwise made known to DOE, the waiver or reduction of a FOIA fee will be granted. In determining when fees should be waived or reduced the appropriate FOIA Officer should address the following two criteria:

(i) That disclosure of the information "is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government." Factors to be considered in applying this criteria include but are not limited to:

(A) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns "the operations or activities of the government";

(B) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is "likely to contribute" to an understanding of government operations or activities;

(C) The contribution to an understanding by the general public of the subject likely to result from disclosure; and

(D) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute "significantly" to public understanding of government operations or activities.

(ii) If disclosure of the information "is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester." Factors to be considered in applying this criteria include but are not limited to:

(A) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so

(B) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is "primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."
