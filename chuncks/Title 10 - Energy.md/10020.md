###### Lamp Arc Voltage.

2.3.4.2.Attach leads from the power analyzer to each fluorescent lamp according to Figure 1 of this section for rapid- and programmed-start ballasts; Figure 2 of this section for instant-start ballasts operating single pin (SP) lamps; and Figure 3 of this section for instant-start ballasts operating medium bipin (MBP), miniature bipin (mini-BP), or recessed double contact (RDC) lamps. The programmed- and rapid-start ballast test setup includes two 1000 ohm resistors placed in parallel with the lamp pins to create a midpoint from which to measure lamp arc voltage.
