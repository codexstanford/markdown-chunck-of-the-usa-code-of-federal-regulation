##### ยง 300.6 Emissions inventories.
###### Covered gases.

(i)Entity-wide emissions inventories must include the emissions of the first six categories of named gases listed in the definition of "greenhouse gases" in ยง 300.2. Entities may report chlorofluorocarbons and other greenhouse gases with quantifiable climate forcing effects as long as DOE has established a method for doing so, but such gases must be reported separately and emission reductions, if any, associated with such other gases are not eligible for registration.
