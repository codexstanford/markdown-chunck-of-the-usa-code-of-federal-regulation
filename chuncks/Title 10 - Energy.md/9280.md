3.8.3

3.8.3.1 Complete sections 3.8.2.1 through 3.8.2.4 of this appendix for a Cold Wash/Cold Rinse cycle. Calculate the remaining moisture content of the maximum test load for Cold Wash/Cold Rinse, RMC, defined as:

3.8.3.2 Apply the RMC correction curve described in section 9 of appendix J3 to this subpart to calculate the corrected remaining moisture content for Cold Wash/Cold Rinse, RMC, expressed as a percentage, as follows:

3.8.3.3 Complete sections 3.8.2.1 through 3.8.2.4 of this appendix using a Warm Wash/Warm Rinse cycle instead. Calculate the remaining moisture content of the maximum test load for Warm Wash/Warm Rinse, RMC, defined as:

3.8.3.4 Apply the RMC correction curve described in section 9 of appendix J3 to this subpart to calculate the corrected remaining moisture content for Warm Wash/Warm Rinse, RMC, expressed as a percentage, as follows:

3.8.3.5 Calculate the corrected remaining moisture content of the maximum test load, RMC, expressed as a percentage as follows:

3.8.3.6 Use RMCas calculated in section 3.8.3.5 as the final corrected RMC used in section 4.3 of this appendix.
