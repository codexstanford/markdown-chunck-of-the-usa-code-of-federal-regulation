###### Appendix I1 to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Conventional Cooking Products
####### Product temperature measurement.

2.5.2Measure the product temperature in degrees Celsius using the equipment specified in section 2.7.3.3 of this appendix at the following locations.

2.5.2.1 Measure the product temperature at the center of the cooking zone under test for any gas burner adjustment in section 3.1.3 of this appendix and per-cooking zone energy consumption test in section 3.1.4 of this appendix, except that the product temperature measurement is not required for any potential simmering setting pre-selection test in section 3.1.4.3 of this appendix. For a conventional gas cooking top, measure the product temperature inside the burner body of the cooking zone under test, after temporarily removing any burner cap on that cooking zone.

2.5.2.2 Measure the temperature at the center of each cooking zone for the standby mode and off mode power test in section 3.2 of this appendix. For a conventional gas cooking top, measure the temperature inside the burner body of each cooking zone, after temporarily removing any burner cap on that cooking zone. Calculate the product temperature as the average of the temperatures at the center of each cooking zone.
