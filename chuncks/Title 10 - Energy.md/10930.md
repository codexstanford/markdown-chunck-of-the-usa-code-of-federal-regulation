####### Cooling Capacity is Above Upper Tolerance.

5.2.1.2If, for any test, the cooling capacity operates above the upper tolerance for the target cooling capacity, adjust any manually-controlled critical parameters per the STI. If the STI does not include a hierarchy of instructions for adjustment of critical parameters to reduce cooling capacity during IEER cooling tests, then reduce only the compressor speed(s) to reduce cooling capacity. If multiple compressors are present in the system, decrease compressor speed by the same absolute increment for each compressor for which the following conditions apply:

(a) The STI specifies a non-zero compressor speed for the compressor for that test and

(b) The compressor has not yet reached minimum speed. Continue reducing cooling capacity in this manner until one of the following occurs:

(1) The unit operates within 3% of the target cooling capacity; or

(2) The RSS point total reaches a budget of 70 points (see section 5.2.1.2.1 of this appendix). For the 75%, 50%, and 25% part-load cooling test points, if the RSS point total reaches 70 during critical parameter adjustments before the capacity operates within 3% of the target cooling capacity, stop adjustment and follow cyclic degradation procedures in accordance with Section 11.2.2.1 of AHRI 1230-2021.
