If a draw is occurring at one hour from the start of the test, continue this draw until the outlet temperature decreases to T*- 15 &#xB0;F (T*- 8.3 &#xB0;C), at which time the draw shall be immediately terminated. (The subscript n shall be used to denote measurements associated with the final draw.) If a draw is not occurring one hour after the start of the test, initiate a final draw at one hour, regardless of whether the criteria described in section 5.3.3.2 of this appendix are satisfied. This draw shall proceed for a minimum of 30 seconds and shall terminate when the outlet temperature first indicates a value less than or equal to the cut-off temperature used for the previous draw (T*). If an outlet temperature greater than T*is not measured within 30 seconds of initiation of the draw, zero additional credit shall be given towards first-hour rating (M*= 0 or V*= 0) based on the final draw. After the final draw is terminated, calculate and record the average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed during the final draw (*and M*or V*, respectively).
