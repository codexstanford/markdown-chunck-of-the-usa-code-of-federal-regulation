###### Portable dehumidifiers and whole-home dehumidifiers other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.

4.1.1Measure the energy consumption in dehumidification mode, E, expressed in kilowatt-hours (kWh), the average relative humidity, H, either as measured using a relative humidity sensor or using the tables provided below when using an aspirating psychrometer, and the product capacity, C, expressed in pints per day (pints/day), in accordance with the test requirements specified in Section 7, "Capacity Test and Energy Consumption Test," of ANSI/AHAM DH-1 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3), except that the standard test conditions for portable dehumidifiers must be maintained at 65 &#xB0;F +/- 2.0 &#xB0;F dry-bulb temperature and 56.6 &#xB0;F +/- 1.0 &#xB0;F wet-bulb temperature, when recording conditions with an aspirating psychrometer, or 60 percent +/- 2 percent relative humidity, when recording conditions with a relative humidity sensor. For whole-home dehumidifiers, conditions must be maintained at 73 &#xB0;F +/- 2.0 &#xB0;F dry-bulb temperature and 63.6 &#xB0;F +/- 1.0 &#xB0;F wet-bulb temperature, when recording conditions with an aspirating psychrometer, or 60 percent +/- 2 percent relative humidity, when recording conditions with a relative humidity sensor. When using relative humidity and dry-bulb temperature sensors, for dehumidifiers with multiple process air intake grilles, average the measured relative humidities and average the measured dry-bulb temperatures to determine the overall intake air conditions.
