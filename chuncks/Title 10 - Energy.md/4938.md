##### § 70.22 Contents of applications.

(a) Each application for a license shall contain the following information:

(1) The full name, address, age (if an individual), and citizenship of the applicant and the names and addresses of three personal references. If the applicant is a corporation or other entity, it shall indicate the State where it was incorporated or organized, the location of the principal office, the names, addresses, and citizenship of its principal officers, and shall include information known to the applicant concerning the control or ownership, if any, exercised over the applicant by any alien, foreign corporation, or foreign government;

(2) The activity for which the special nuclear material is requested, or in which special nuclear material will be produced, the place at which the activity is to be performed and the general plan for carrying out the activity;

(3) The period of time for which the license is requested;

(4) The name, amount, and specifications (including the chemical and physical form and, where applicable, isotopic content) of the special nuclear material the applicant proposes to use or produce;

(5) [Reserved]

(6) The technical qualifications, including training and experience of the applicant and members of his staff to engage in the proposed activities in accordance with the regulations in this chapter;

(7) A description of equipment and facilities which will be used by the applicant to protect health and minimize danger to life or property (such as handling devices, working areas, shields, measuring and monitoring instruments, devices for the disposal of radioactive effluents and wastes, storage facilities, criticality accident alarm systems, etc.);

(8) Proposed procedures to protect health and minimize danger to life or property (such as procedures to avoid accidental criticality, procedures for personnel monitoring and waste disposal, post-criticality accident emergency procedures, etc.).

(9) As provided by § 70.25, certain applications for specific licenses filed under this part must contain a proposed decommissioning funding plan or a certification of financial assurance for decommissioning. In the case of renewal applications submitted on or before July 27, 1990, this submittal may follow the renewal application but must be submitted on or before July 27, 1990.

(b) Each application for a license to possess special nuclear material, to possess equipment capable of enriching uranium, to operate an uranium enrichment facility, to possess and use at any one time and location special nuclear material in a quantity exceeding one effective kilogram, except for applications for use as sealed sources and for those uses involved in the operation of a nuclear reactor licensed pursuant to part 50 of this chapter and those involved in a waste disposal operation, must contain a full description of the applicant's program for control and accounting of such special nuclear material or enrichment equipment that will be in the applicant's possession under license to show how compliance with the requirements of §§ 74.31, 74.33, 74.41, or 74.51 of this chapter, as applicable, will be accomplished.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) The Commission may at any time after the filing of the original application, and before the expiration of the license, require further statements in order to enable the Commission to determine whether the application should be granted or denied or whether a license should be modified or revoked. All applications and statements shall be signed by the applicant or licensee or a corporate officer thereof.

(e) Each application and statement shall contain complete and accurate disclosure as to all matters and things required to be disclosed.

(f) Each application for a license to possess and use special nuclear material in a plutonium processing and fuel fabrication plant shall contain, in addition to the other information required by this section, a description of the plantsite, a description and safety assessment of the design bases of the principal structure, systems, and components of the plant, including provisions for protection against natural phenomena, and a description of the quality assurance program to be applied to the design, fabrication, construction, testing and operation of the structures, systems, and components of the plant.

(g)(1) Each application for a license that would authorize the transport or delivery to a carrier for transport of special nuclear material in an amount specified in § 73.1(b)(2) of this chapter must include (i) a description of the plan for physical protection of special nuclear material in transit in accordance with §§ 73.20, 73.25, 73.26, 73.27, and 73.67 (a), (e), and (g) for 10 kg or more of special nuclear material of low strategic significance, and § 73.70(g) of this chapter including, as appropriate, a plan for the selection, qualification, and training of armed escorts, or the specification and design of a specially designed truck or trailer, and (ii) a licensee safeguards contingency plan or response procedures, as appropriate, for dealing with threats, thefts, and radiological sabotage relating to the special nuclear material in transit.

(2) Each application for such a license involving formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material must include the first four categories of information contained in the applicant's safeguards contingency plan. (The first four categories of information, as set forth in appendix C to part 73 of this chapter, are Background, Generic Planning Base, Licensee Planning Base, and Responsibility Matrix. The fifth category of information, Procedures, does not have to be submitted for approval.)

(3) The licensee shall retain this description of the plan for physical protection of special nuclear material in transit and the safeguards contingency plan or safeguards response procedures and each change to the plan or procedures as a record for a period of three years following the date on which the licensee last possessed the appropriate type and quantity of special nuclear material requiring this record under each license.

(h)(1) Each application for a license to possess or use, at any site or contiguous sites subject to licensee control, a formula quantity of strategic special nuclear material, as defined in § 70.4, other than a license for possession or use of this material in the operation of a nuclear reactor licensed pursuant to part 50 of this chapter, must include a physical security plan. The plan must describe how the applicant will meet the applicable requirements of part 73 of this chapter in the conduct of the activity to be licensed, including the identification and description of jobs as required by 10 CFR 11.11(a). The plan must list tests, inspections, audits, and other means to be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 10 CFR parts 11 and 73, if applicable.

(2) The licensee shall retain a copy of this physical security plan and each change to the plan as a record for a period of three years following the date on which the licensee last possessed the appropriate type and quantity of special nuclear material requiring this record under each license.

(i)(1) Each application to possess enriched uranium or plutonium for which a criticality accident alarm system is required, uranium hexafluoride in excess of 50 kilograms in a single container or 1000 kilograms total, or in excess of 2 curies of plutonium in unsealed form or on foils or plated sources, must contain either:

(i) An evaluation showing that the maximum dose to a member of the public offsite due to a release of radioactive materials would not exceed 1 rem effective dose equivalent or an intake of 2 milligrams of soluble uranium, or

(ii) An emergency plan for responding to the radiological hazards of an accidental release of special nuclear material and to any associated chemical hazards directly incident thereto.

(2) One or more of the following factors may be used to support an evaluation submitted under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section:

(i) The radioactive material is physically separated so that only a portion could be involved in an accident;

(ii) All or part of the radioactive material is not subject to release during an accident or to criticality because of the way it is stored or packaged;

(iii) In the case of fires or explosions, the release fraction would be lower than 0.001 due to the chemical or physical form of the material;

(iv) The solubility of the material released would reduce the dose received;

(v) The facility design or engineered safety features in the facility would cause the release fraction to be lower than 0.001;

(vi) Operating restrictions or procedures would prevent a release large enough to cause a member of the public offsite to receive a dose exceeding 1 rem effective dose equivalent; or

(vii) Other factors appropriate for the specific facility.

(3) Emergency plans submitted under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section must include the following information:
