(2)(i) For models other than models of outdoor units with no match, if manufacturers certify that they did not conduct the optional tests to determine the Cand/or Cvalue for an individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split systems), as applicable, the default value of Cand/or Cwill be used as the basis for calculation of SEER2 or HSPF2 for each unit tested. If manufacturers certify that they conducted the optional tests to determine the value of Cand/or Cfor an individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split systems), as applicable, the value of Cand/or Cwill be measured pursuant to the test requirements of appendix F1 to subpart F of part 431 for each unit tested. The result for each unit tested (either the tested value or the default value, as selected according to the criteria for the cyclic test in section 4 of appendix F1 to subpart F of part 431) will be used as the basis for calculation of SEER2 or HSPF2 for that unit.
