####### i.e.,

(b) If a non-soil-sensing dishwasher is not tested at a certain soil load as specified in section 4.1.d of this appendix, use the energy and water consumption values of the preceding soil load when calculating the weighted average energy and water consumption values (if the sensor medium response and sensor light response tests on the normal cycle are not conducted, use the values of the sensor heavy response test for all three soil loads; if only the sensor light response test is not conducted, use the values of the sensor medium response test for the sensor light response test).

(c) For dishwashers that do not have a direct water line, water consumption is equal to the volume of water use in the test cycle, as specified by the manufacturer.

(d) In sections 5.6.1.3, 5.6.1.4, 5.6.2.3, and 5.6.2.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use (C/e) in place of K.
