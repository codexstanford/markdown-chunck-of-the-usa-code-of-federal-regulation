####### Determination of represented value.

(a)Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model by testing (which includes the calculation-based methods in the test procedure), in conjunction with the following sampling provisions. Manufacturers must update represented values to account for any change in the applicable motor standards in ยง 431.25 of this chapter and certify amended values as of the next annual certification.

(1) Units to be tested. The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to pumps; and for each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that-

(i) Any representation of the constant load pump energy index (PEI), variable load pump energy index (PEI), circulator energy index (CEI), or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample,

Or,

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05,

(ii) Any representation of weighted energy factor of a basic model must be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

And xis the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xis the maximum of the ith sample; or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

And xis the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and tis the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of this subpart).
