###### Greenhouse gases

means the gases that may be reported to the Department of Energy under this program. They are:

(1) Carbon dioxide (CO)

(2) Methane (CH)

(3) Nitrous oxide (NO)

(4) HydrofluorocarbonsHFC-23 [trifluoromethane-(CHF]HFC-32 [trifluoromethane-CHF], CHCF, CHF, CHFCF, CHFCF, CHFCF, CHFCHF, CFCH, CHFCHF, CHCHF, CHCHF, CFCHFCF, CHFCFCF, CHFCHFCF, CFCHCF, CHFCFCHF, CHFCHCF, CFCHCFCH, CHCHFCHFCF)

(5) Perfluorocarbons (perfluoromethane-CF, perfluoroethane-CF, CF, CF, c-CF, CF, CF)

(6) Sulfur hexafluoride (SF)

(7) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 [trichlorofluoromethane-CClF], CClF, CClF, CClFCClF, CClFCClF, ClFCClF,)

(8) Other gases or particles that have been demonstrated to have significant, quantifiable climate forcing effects when released to the atmosphere in significant quantities and for which DOE has established or approved methods for estimating emissions and reductions. (As provided in ยง 300.6(i), chlorofluorcarbons and other gases with quantifiable climate forcing effects may be reported to the 1605(b) program if DOE has established an appropriate emission inventory or emission reduction calculation method, but reductions of these gases may not be registered.)
