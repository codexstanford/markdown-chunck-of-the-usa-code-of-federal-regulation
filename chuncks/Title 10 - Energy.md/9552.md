####### i.e.,

(2) For single-stage systems, for all steady-state wet coil tests (the A and B tests), decrease Q(T) by the quantity calculated in Equation 3.3-7 to this appendix and increase E(T) by the quantity calculated in Equation 3.3-8 to this appendix.

f. For air conditioners and heat pumps having a constant-air-volume-rate indoor blower, the five additional steps listed below are required if the average of the measured external static pressures exceeds the applicable sections 3.1.4 minimum (or target) external static pressure (ΔP) by 0.03 inches of water or more.

(1) Measure the average power consumption of the indoor blower motor (E) and record the corresponding external static pressure (ΔP) during or immediately following the 30-minute interval used for determining capacity.

(2) After completing the 30-minute interval and while maintaining the same test conditions, adjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until the external static pressure increases to approximately ΔP+ (ΔP- ΔP).

(3) After re-establishing steady readings of the fan motor power and external static pressure, determine average values for the indoor blower power (E) and the external static pressure (ΔP) by making measurements over a 5-minute interval.

(4) Approximate the average power consumption of the indoor blower motor at ΔPusing linear extrapolation:

(5) Increase the total space cooling capacity, Q(T), by the quantity (E- E), when expressed on a Btu/h basis. Decrease the total electrical power, E(T), by the same fan power difference, now expressed in watts.

a. Except for the modifications noted in this section, conduct the steady-state dry coil cooling mode tests as specified in section 3.3 of this appendix for wet coil tests. Prior to recording data during the steady-state dry coil test, operate the unit at least one hour after achieving dry coil conditions. Drain the drain pan and plug the drain opening. Thereafter, the drain pan should remain completely dry.
