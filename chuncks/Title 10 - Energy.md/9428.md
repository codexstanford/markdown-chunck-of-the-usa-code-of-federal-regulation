For coil-only split systems and blower coil split systems for which a furnace or a modular blower is the designated air mover, subtract the low-voltage power () from the heating season total off mode power () and divide by the number of compressors to calculate, the heating season per-compressor off mode power. Roundto the nearest watt. The expression for calculatingis as follows:

f. Shoulder-season per-compressor off mode power, P1: If the system does not have a crankcase heater, has a crankcase heater without controls that is not self-regulating, or has a value for the crankcase heater turn-on temperature (as certified in the DOE Compliance Certification Database) that is higher than 71 &#xB0;F, P1 is equal to P2.
