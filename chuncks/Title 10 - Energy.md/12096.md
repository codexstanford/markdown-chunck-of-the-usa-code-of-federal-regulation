####### Storage Volume Symbols in Table 404.1.

404.1.3The symbol "V" is the rated storage volume in gallons as specified by the manufacturer. The symbol "V" is the storage volume in gallons as measured during the test to determine the standby loss. Vmay differ from V, but it is within tolerances allowed by the applicable Z21 and Underwriters Laboratories standards. Accordingly, for the purpose of estimating the standby loss requirement using the rated volume shown on the rating plate, Vshould be considered as no less than 0.95V for gas and oil water heaters and no less than 0.90V for electric water heaters.
