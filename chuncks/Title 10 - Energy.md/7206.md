#### PART 300 - VOLUNTARY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM: GENERAL GUIDELINES
##### § 300.1 General.
###### Reporting under the program.

(b)(1) Each reporting entity, whether or not it intends to register emissions as described in paragraph (c) of this section, must:

(i) File an entity statement that meets the appropriate requirements in § 300.5(d) through (f) of this part;

(ii) Use appropriate emission inventory and emission reduction calculation methods specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13), and calculate and report the weighted average quality rating of any emission inventories it reports;

(iii) Comply with the record keeping requirements in § 300.9 of this part; and

(iv) Comply with the certification requirements in § 300.10 of this part;

(2) Each reporting entity, whether or not it intends to register emissions as described in paragraph (c) of this section, may report offset reductions achieved by other entities outside their boundaries as long as such reductions are reported separately and calculated in accordance with methods specified in the Technical Guidelines. The third-party entity that achieved these reductions must agree to their being reported as offset reductions, and must also meet all of the requirements of reporting that would apply if the third-party entity reported directly under the 1605(b) program.

(3) An entity that intends to register emissions and emission reductions must meet the additional requirements referenced in paragraph (c) of this section.

(4) An entity that does not intend to register emissions and emission reductions may choose to report its emissions and/or emission reductions on an entity-wide basis or for selected elements of the entity, selected gases or selected sources.

(5) An entity that does not intend to register emissions may report emission inventories for any year back to 1990 and may report emission reductions for any year back to 1991, relative to a base period of one to four years, ending no earlier than 1990.
