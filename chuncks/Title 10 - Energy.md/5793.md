(e)

(1) Only licensees included within the classes of facilities, radioactive material, and other property listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may apply to the NRC for combined preemption authority and enhanced weapons authority.

(2) Licensees applying for combined preemption authority and enhanced weapons authority must submit an application to the NRC using the procedures specified in this section.

(3) The contents of the application must include the following information:

(i) A statement indicating that the licensee is applying for combined preemption authority and enhanced weapons authority;

(ii) The Commission-designated facility, radioactive material, or other property to be protected by the licensee's security personnel using the covered weapons, including enhanced weapons;

(iii) A description of the licensee's purposes and objectives in requesting combined preemption authority and enhanced weapons authority. This must include whether these enhanced weapons are currently employed as part of the licensee's existing protective strategy or whether these enhanced weapons will be used in a revised protective strategy;

(iv) The total quantities of enhanced weapons, including the types and calibers or gauges, requested; and

(v) A description of the licensee's Firearms Background Check Plan, required by § 73.17 of this part.

(vi) If the NRC has previously approved the licensee's application for stand-alone preemption authority under either paragraph (d) of this section or under an NRC Order issued before April 13, 2023, then the licensee must include the effective date of the NRC's approval for stand-alone preemption authority in its application for combined preemption authority and enhanced weapons.

(4) The licensee must include with its application the additional technical information required by paragraph (f) of this section.

(5) Once a licensee has been notified that its application for combined preemption authority and enhanced weapons authority has been accepted for review by the NRC, the licensee must provide the following supplemental information once it becomes available:

(i) A confirmation that a sufficient number of security personnel have completed a satisfactory firearms background check to meet the licensee's security personnel minimum staffing requirements, as specified in its physical security plan, and any applicable fatigue requirements under part 26 of this chapter;

(ii) A confirmation that the necessary training modules and notification procedures have been developed under its Firearms Background Check Plan; and

(iii) A confirmation that security personnel, whose official duties require access to enhanced weapons, have been trained on these modules and notification procedures.

(iv) Exceptions: Licensees that were previously approved by the NRC for stand-alone preemption authority do not have to submit the supplemental information required by paragraph (e)(5) since it has been previously submitted under paragraph (d)(4) of this section or in response to an NRC Order.

(6) The licensee must submit its application in accordance with the applicable license amendment provisions specified in § 50.90, § 70.34, or § 72.56 of this chapter.

(7) If a licensee wishes to use a different type or caliber or gauge of an enhanced weapon or obtain a different quantity of enhanced weapons from that previously approved by the Commission under this section, then the licensee must submit a new application to the NRC in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section (to address these different weapons or different quantities of weapons).

(8) Upon the effective date of the NRC's approval of its application for combined preemption authority and enhanced weapons authority, the licensee must only assign security personnel who have completed a satisfactory firearms background check to duties requiring access to any covered weapons.
