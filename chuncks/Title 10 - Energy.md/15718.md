#### Appendix A to Part 851 - Worker Safety and Health Functional Areas

This appendix establishes the mandatory requirements for implementing the applicable functional areas required by ยง 851.24.

(a) For each separately definable construction activity (e.g., excavations, foundations, structural steel, roofing) the construction contractor must:

(1) Prepare and have approved by the construction manager an activity hazard analysis prior to commencement of affected work. Such analyses must:

(i) Identify foreseeable hazards and planned protective measures;

(ii) Address further hazards revealed by supplemental site information (e.g., site characterization data, as-built drawings) provided by the construction manager;

(iii) Provide drawings and/or other documentation of protective measures for which applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards require preparation by a Professional Engineer or other qualified professional, and

(iv) Identify competent persons required for workplace inspections of the construction activity, where required by OSHA standards.

(2) Ensure workers are aware of foreseeable hazards and the protective measures described within the activity analysis prior to beginning work on the affected activity.

(3) Require that workers acknowledge being informed of the hazards and protective measures associated with assigned work activities. Those workers failing to utilize appropriate protective measures must be subject to the construction contractor's disciplinary process.
