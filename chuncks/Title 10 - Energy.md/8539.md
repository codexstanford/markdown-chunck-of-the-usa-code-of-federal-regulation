(iii) When gas-heated or oil-heated water is used,

(2) The estimated annual energy use, EAEU, expressed in kilowatt-hours per year must be rounded to the nearest kilowatt-hour per year and is defined as follows:

(3) The sum of the water consumption, V, the water consumption during water softener regeneration, V, the water consumption during drain out events for dishwashers equipped with a water re-use system, V, and the water consumption during clean out events for dishwashers equipped with a water re-use system, V, expressed in gallons per cycle and defined pursuant to section 5 of appendix C1 or appendix C2 to this subpart, as applicable, must be rounded to one decimal place.
