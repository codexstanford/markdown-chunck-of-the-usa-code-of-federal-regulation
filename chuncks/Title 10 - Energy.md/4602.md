###### Classification determined by long-lived radionuclides.

(3)If radioactive waste contains only radionuclides listed in Table 1, classification shall be determined as follows:

(i) If the concentration does not exceed 0.1 times the value in Table 1, the waste is Class A.

(ii) If the concentration exceeds 0.1 times the value in Table 1 but does not exceed the value in Table 1, the waste is Class C.

(iii) If the concentration exceeds the value in Table 1, the waste is not generally acceptable for near-surface disposal.

(iv) For wastes containing mixtures of radionuclides listed in Table 1, the total concentration shall be determined by the sum of fractions rule described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
