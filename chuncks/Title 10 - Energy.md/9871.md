###### 2.3.1 Natural gas.

For a gas-fueled vented heater, maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at an inlet test pressure immediately ahead of all controls at 7 to 10 inches water column. If the heater is equipped with a gas pressure regulator, maintain the regulator outlet pressure within the greater of +/-0.2 inches water column, or +/-10 percent, of the manufacturer-specified manifold pressure on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual. Use natural gas having a specific gravity between 0.57 and 0.70 and a higher heating value within +/-5 percent of 1,025 Btu per standard cubic foot. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot for the natural gas to be used in the test with an error no greater than one percent. If the burner cannot be adjusted to obtain a heat input rate of within +/-2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual, as required by section 2.4.1 of this appendix, maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at an inlet test pressure immediately ahead of all controls at any value within the range specified on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual that results in a heat input rate of within +/-2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual.
