####### Vented home heating equipment.

(o)(1) When determining the annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) of vented home heating equipment (see the note at the beginning of appendix O), expressed in percent (%), calculate AFUE in accordance with section 4.1.17 of appendix O of this subpart for vented heaters without either manual controls or thermal stack dampers; in accordance with section 4.2.6 of appendix O of this subpart for vented heaters equipped with manual controls; or in accordance with section 4.3.7 of appendix O of this subpart for vented heaters equipped with thermal stack dampers.

(2) When estimating the annual operating cost for vented home heating equipment, calculate the sum of:

(i) The product of the average annual fuel energy consumption, in Btus per year for natural gas, propane, or oil fueled vented home heating equipment, determined according to section 4.6.2 of appendix O of this subpart, and the representative average unit cost in dollars per Btu for natural gas, propane, or oil, as appropriate, as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act; plus

(ii) The product of the average annual auxiliary electric energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per year determined according to section 4.6.3 of appendix O of this subpart, and the representative average unit cost in dollars per kilowatt-hours as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act. Round the resulting sum to the nearest dollar per year.

(3) When estimating the operating cost per million Btu output for gas or oil vented home heating equipment with an auxiliary electric system, calculate the product of:

(i) The quotient of one million Btu divided by the sum of:

(A) The product of the maximum fuel input in Btus per hour as determined in sections 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of appendix O of this subpart times the annual fuel utilization efficiency in percent as determined in sections 4.1.17, 4.2.6, or 4.3.7 of this appendix (as appropriate) divided by 100, plus

(B) The product of the maximum electric power in watts as determined in section 3.1.3 of appendix O of this subpart times the quantity 3.412; and

(ii) The sum of:

(A) the product of the maximum fuel input in Btus per hour as determined in sections 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this appendix times the representative unit cost in dollars per Btu for natural gas, propane, or oil, as appropriate, as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act; plus

(B) the product of the maximum auxiliary electric power in kilowatts as determined in section 3.1.3 of appendix O of this subpart times the representative unit cost in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act. Round the resulting quantity to the nearest 0.01 dollar per million Btu output.
