####### Annual Operating Cost-Cooling.

(1)Determine the represented value of estimated annual operating cost for cooling-only units or the cooling portion of the estimated annual operating cost for air-source heat pumps that provide both heating and cooling by calculating the product of:

(i) The value determined in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section if using appendix M to subpart B of part 430 or the value determined in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section if using appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430;

(A) The quotient of the represented value of cooling capacity, in Btu's per hour as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, divided by the represented value of SEER, in Btu's per watt-hour, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section;

(B) The quotient of the represented value of cooling capacity, in Btu's per hour as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, and multiplied by 0.93 for variable-speed heat pumps only, divided by the represented value of SEER2, in Btu's per watt-hour, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.

(ii) The representative average use cycle for cooling of 1,000 hours per year;

(iii) A conversion factor of 0.001 kilowatt per watt; and

(iv) The representative average unit cost of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act.
