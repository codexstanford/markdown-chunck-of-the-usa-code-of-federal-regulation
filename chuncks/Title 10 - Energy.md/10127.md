2.10.means the result of dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the average value for a contiguous set of separate time-averaged light output values spanning the specified time period. For a waveform of measured light output values, the time-averaged light output is computed over one full cycle of sinusoidal input voltage, as a moving average where the measurement interval is incremented by one sample for each successive measurement value.
