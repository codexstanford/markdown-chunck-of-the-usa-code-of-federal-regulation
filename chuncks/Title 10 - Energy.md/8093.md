() Activate power to the pump with the flow rate set to zero (the pump is energized but not circulating water). Set the ambient temperature to 42.0 +/- 0.5 &#xB0;F and allow the temperature to stabilize, where stability is determined in accordance with section 40.6.3.2.2 of HI 40.6-2014-B. After 5 minutes, decrease the temperature measured by the freeze protection temperature sensor by 1.0 +/- 0.5 &#xB0;F and allow the temperature to stabilize. After each reduction in ambient temperature and subsequent stabilization, record the DPPP rotating speed, if any, and freeze protection ambient temperature reading, where the "freeze protection ambient temperature reading" is representative of the temperature measured by the freeze protection ambient temperature sensor, which may be recorded by a variety of means depending on how the temperature is being simulated and controlled. If no flow is initiated, record zero rpm or no flow. Continue decreasing the temperature measured by the freeze protection temperature sensor by 1.0 +/- 0.5 &#xB0;F after 5.0 minutes of stable operation at the previous temperature reading until the pump freeze protection initiates water circulation or until the ambient temperature of 38.0 +/- 0.5 &#xB0;F has been evaluated (the end of the 5.0 minute interval of 38.0 &#xB0;F), whichever occurs first.
