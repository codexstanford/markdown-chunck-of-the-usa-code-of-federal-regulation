####### Standby mode and off mode supply voltage.

2.2.1.1.2During standby mode and off mode testing, maintain the electrical supply to the product at either 240 volts +/-1 percent, or 120 volts +/-1 percent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Maintain the electrical supply voltage waveform specified in Section 4, Paragraph 4.3.2 of IEC 62301 (Second Edition), disregarding the provisions regarding batteries and the determination, classification, and testing of relevant modes. If the power measuring instrument used for testing is unable to measure and record the total harmonic content during the test measurement period, total harmonic content may be measured and recorded immediately before and after the test measurement period.
