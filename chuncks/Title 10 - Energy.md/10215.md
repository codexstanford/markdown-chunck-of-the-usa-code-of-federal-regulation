###### Off-cycle mode.

4.2Establish the test conditions specified in section 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this appendix, but use the wattmeter specified in section 3.2.3 of this appendix. Begin the off-cycle mode test period immediately following the dehumidification mode test period. Adjust the setpoint higher than the ambient relative humidity to ensure the product will not enter dehumidification mode and begin the test when the compressor cycles off due to the change in setpoint. The off-cycle mode test period shall be 2 hours in duration, during which the power consumption is recorded at the same intervals as recorded for dehumidification mode testing. Measure and record the average off-cycle mode power of the dehumidifier, P, in watts.
