##### ยง 95.25 Protection of National Security Information and Restricted Data in storage.

(a) Secret matter, while unattended or not in actual use, must be stored in-

(1) A safe, steel file cabinet, or safe-type steel file container that has an automatic unit locking mechanism. All such receptacles will be accorded supplemental protection during non-working hours; or

(2) Any steel file cabinet that has four sides and a top and bottom (all permanently attached by welding, rivets, or peened bolts so the contents cannot be removed without leaving visible evidence of entry) and is secured by a rigid metal lock bar and an approved key operated or combination padlock. The keepers of the rigid metal lock bar must be secured to the cabinet by welding, rivets, or bolts, so they cannot be removed and replaced without leaving evidence of the entry. The drawers of the container must be held securely so their contents cannot be removed without forcing open the drawer. This type of cabinet will be accorded supplemental protection during non-working hours.

(b) Confidential matter while unattended or not in use must be stored in the same manner as SECRET matter except that no supplemental protection is required.
