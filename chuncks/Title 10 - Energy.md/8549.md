####### Furnaces.

(n)(1) The estimated annual operating cost for furnaces is the sum of:

(i) The product of the average annual fuel energy consumption, in Btu's per year for gas or oil furnaces or in kilowatt-hours per year for electric furnaces, determined according to section 10.2.2 or 10.3 of appendix N of this subpart, respectively, (for furnaces, excluding low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) or section 10.2.2 or 10.3 of appendix EE of this subpart, respectively (for low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers), and the representative average unit cost in dollars per Btu for gas or oil, or dollars per kilowatt-hour for electric, as appropriate, as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act; plus

(ii) The product of the average annual auxiliary electric energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per year determined according to section 10.2.3 of appendix N of this subpart (for furnaces, excluding low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) or section 10.2.3 of appendix EE of this subpart (for low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) of this subpart, and the representative average unit cost in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act.

(iii) Round the resulting sum to the nearest dollar per year.

(2) The annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) for furnaces, expressed in percent, is the ratio of the annual fuel output of useful energy delivered to the heated space to the annual fuel energy input to the furnace.

(i) For gas and oil furnaces, determine AFUE according to section 10.1 of appendix N (for furnaces, excluding low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) or section 10.1 of appendix EE (for low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) of this subpart, as applicable.
