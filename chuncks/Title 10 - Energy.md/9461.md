###### Appendix M1 to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps
####### Coefficient of Performance (COP)

means the ratio of the average rate of space heating delivered to the average rate of electrical energy consumed by the heat pump. Determine these rate quantities from a single test or, if derived via interpolation, determine at a single set of operating conditions. COP is a dimensionless quantity. When determined for a ducted coil-only system, COP must be calculated using the default values for heat output and power input of a fan motor specified in sections 3.7 and 3.9.1 of this appendix.
