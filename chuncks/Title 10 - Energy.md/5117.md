(2)Subjection of the specimen to a dynamic crush test by positioning the specimen on a flat, essentially unyielding horizontal surface so as to suffer maximum damage by the drop of a 500-kg (1100-lb) mass from 9 m (30 ft) onto the specimen. The mass must consist of a solid mild steel plate 1 m (40 in) by 1 m (40 in) and must fall in a horizontal attitude. The crush test is required only when the specimen has a mass not greater than 500 kg (1100 lb), an overall density not greater than 1000 kg/m(62.4 lb/ft) based on external dimension, and radioactive contents greater than 1000 Anot as special form radioactive material. For packages containing fissile material, the radioactive contents greater than 1000 Acriterion does not apply.
