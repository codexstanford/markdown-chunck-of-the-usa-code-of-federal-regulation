####### Clothes dryers.

(d)(1) The estimated annual energy consumption for clothes dryers, expressed in kilowatt-hours per year, shall be the product of the annual representative average number of clothes dryer cycles as specified in appendix D1 or D2 to this subpart, as appropriate, and the per-cycle combined total energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per cycle, determined according to section 4.6 of appendix D1 or section 4.6 of appendix D2 to this subpart, as appropriate.

(2) The estimated annual operating cost for clothes dryers shall be-

(i) For an electric clothes dryer, the product of the following three factors, with the resulting product then being rounded off to the nearest dollar per year:

(A) The annual representative average number of clothes dryer cycles as specified in appendix D1 or appendix D2 to this subpart, as appropriate;

(B) The per-cycle combined total energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per cycle, determined according to section 4.6 of appendix D1 or section 4.6 of appendix D2 to this subpart, as appropriate; and

(C) The representative average unit cost of electrical energy in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided by the Secretary; and

(ii) For a gas clothes dryer, the product of the annual representative average number of clothes dryer cycles as specified in appendix D1 or D2 to this subpart, as appropriate, times the sum of the following three factors, with the resulting product then being rounded off to the nearest dollar per year:

(A) The product of the per-cycle gas dryer electric energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per cycle, determined according to section 4.2 of appendix D1 or section 4.2 of appendix D2 to this subpart, as appropriate, times the representative average unit cost of electrical energy in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided by the Secretary; plus,

(B) The product of the per-cycle gas dryer gas energy consumption, in Btus per cycle, determined according to section 4.3 of appendix D1 or section 4.3 of appendix D2 to this subpart, as appropriate, times the representative average unit cost for natural gas or propane, as appropriate, in dollars per Btu as provided by the Secretary; plus,

(C) The product of the per-cycle standby mode and off mode energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per cycle, determined according to section 4.5 of appendix D1 or section 4.5 of appendix D2 to this subpart, as appropriate, times the representative average unit cost of electrical energy in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided by the Secretary.

(3) The combined energy factor, expressed in pounds per kilowatt-hour is determined in accordance with section 4.7 of appendix D1 or section 4.7 of appendix D2 to this subpart, as appropriate, the result then being rounded off to the nearest hundredth (0.01).

(4) Other useful measures of energy consumption for clothes dryers shall be those measures of energy consumption for clothes dryers which the Secretary determines are likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and which are derived from the application of appendix D1 or D2 to this subpart, as appropriate.
