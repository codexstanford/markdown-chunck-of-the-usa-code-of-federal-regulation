###### Appendix M1 to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps

Prior to January 1, 2023, any representations, including compliance certifications, made with respect to the energy use, power, or efficiency of central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps must be based on the results of testing pursuant to appendix M of this subpart.

On or after January 1, 2023, any representations, including compliance certifications, made with respect to the energy use, power, or efficiency of central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps must be based on the results of testing pursuant to this appendix.

This test procedure provides a method of determining SEER2, EER2, HSPF2 and Pfor central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps including the following categories:

(h) Split-system air conditioners, including single-split, multi-head mini-split, multi-split (including VRF), and multi-circuit systems

(i) Split-system heat pumps, including single-split, multi-head mini-split, multi-split (including VRF), and multi-circuit systems

(j) Single-package air conditioners

(k) Single-package heat pumps

(l) Small-duct, high-velocity systems (including VRF)

(m) Space-constrained products-air conditioners

(n) Space-constrained products-heat pumps

For the purposes of this appendix, the Department of Energy incorporates by reference specific sections of several industry standards, as listed in ยง 430.3. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over the incorporated standards.

All section references refer to sections within this appendix unless otherwise stated.
