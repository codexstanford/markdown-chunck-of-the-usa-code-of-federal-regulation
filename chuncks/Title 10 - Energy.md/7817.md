####### Sampling plans and represented values.

(2)For individual models (for single-package systems) or individual combinations (for split-systems, including "tested combinations" for multi-split, multi-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems) with represented values determined through testing, each individual model/combination (or "tested combination") must have a sample of sufficient size tested in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart. For heat pumps (other than heating-only heat pumps), all units of the sample population must be tested in both the cooling and heating modes and the results used for determining all representations. The represented values for any individual model/combination must be assigned such that:
