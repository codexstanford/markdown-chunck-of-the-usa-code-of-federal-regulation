##### ยง 850.35 Medical removal.
###### Temporary removal pending final medical determination.

(1)The responsible employer must offer a beryllium-associated worker temporary medical removal from exposure to beryllium on each occasion that the SOMD determines in a written medical opinion that the worker should be temporarily removed from such exposure pending a final medical determination of whether the worker should be removed permanently.

(i) In this section, "final medical determination" means the outcome of the multiple physician review process or the alternate medical determination process provided for in paragraphs (c) and (d) of ยง 850.34.

(ii) If a beryllium-associated worker is temporarily removed from beryllium exposure pursuant to this section, the responsible employer must transfer the worker to a comparable job for which the worker is qualified (or for which the worker can be trained in a short period) and where beryllium exposures are as low as possible, but in no event at or above the action level.

(iii) The responsible employer must maintain the beryllium-associated worker's total normal earnings, seniority, and other worker rights and benefits as if the worker had not been removed.

(iv) If there is no such job available, the responsible employer must provide to the beryllium-associated worker the medical removal protection benefits specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, until a job becomes available or for one year, whichever comes first.
