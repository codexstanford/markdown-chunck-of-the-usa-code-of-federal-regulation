####### Commercial gas-fired and oil-fired instantaneous water heaters and hot water supply boilers.

(e)The storage volume of a commercial gas-fired or oil-fired instantaneous water heater or a commercial gas-fired or oil-fired hot water supply boiler basic model may be determined by performing a calculation of the stored water volume based upon design drawings (including computer-aided design (CAD) models) or physical dimensions of the basic model. Any value of storage volume of a basic model reported to DOE in a certification of compliance in accordance with ยง 429.44(c)(2)(iv) and (v) must be calculated using the design drawings or physical dimensions, or measured as per the applicable provisions in the test procedures in 10 CFR 431.106. The storage volume determination must include all water contained within the water heater from the inlet connection to the outlet connection(s). The storage volume of water contained in the water heater must then be computed in gallons.
