####### i.e.,

(iv) For a dedicated-purpose pool pump (other than an integral cartridge-filter or sand-filter pool pump): weighted energy factor (WEF) in kilogallons per kilowatt-hour (kgal/kWh); rated hydraulic horsepower in horsepower (hp); the speed configuration for which the pump is being rated (single-speed, two-speed, multi-speed, or variable-speed); true power factor at all applicable test procedure load points i (dimensionless), as specified in Table 1 of appendix B or C to subpart Y of part 431 of this chapter, as applicable; dedicated-purpose pool pump nominal motor horsepower in horsepower (hp); dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower in horsepower (hp); dedicated-purpose pool pump service factor (dimensionless); for self-priming pool filter pumps and non-self-priming pool filter pumps: the maximum head (in feet) which is based on the mean of the units in the tested sample; a statement regarding whether freeze protection is shipped enabled or disabled; for dedicated-purpose pool pumps (DPPPs) distributed in commerce with freeze protection controls enabled: the default dry-bulb air temperature setting (in &#xB0;F), default run time setting (in minutes), and default motor speed (in rpm); for self-priming pool filter pumps a statement regarding whether the pump is certified with NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 429.4) as self-priming; and, for self-priming pool filter pumps that are not certified with NSF/ANSI 50-2015 as self-priming: the vertical lift (in feet) and true priming time (in minutes) for the DPPP model.

(v) For integral cartridge-filter and sand-filter pool pumps, the maximum run-time (in hours) of the pool pump control with which the integral cartridge-filter or sand-filter pump is distributed in commerce.

(3) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), a certification report may include the following public product-specific information:

(i) For a pump subject to the test methods prescribed in section III of appendix A to subpart Y of part 431 of this chapter: Pump efficiency at BEP in percent (%) and PER.

(ii) For a pump subject to the test methods prescribed in section IV or V of appendix A to subpart Y of part 431 of this chapter: Pump efficiency at BEP in percent (%) and PER.

(iii) For a pump subject to the test methods prescribed in section VI or VII of appendix A to subpart Y of part 431 of this chapter: Pump efficiency at BEP in percent (%) and PER.

(iv) For a dedicated-purpose pool pump (other than an integral cartridge-filter or sand-filter pool pump): Calculated driver power input and flow rate at each load point i (Pand Q), in horsepower (hp) and gallons per minute (gpm), respectively.

(4) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), a certification report will include the following product-specific information:
