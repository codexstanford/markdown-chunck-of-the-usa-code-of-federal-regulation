####### et seq.

In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 6295(p)(4), on receipt of a joint proposal, including a consensus recommendation developed in accordance with the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (5 U.S.C. 561), that is submitted by interested persons that are fairly representative of relevant points of view, DOE may issue a direct final rule (DFR) establishing energy conservation standards for a covered product or equipment if DOE determines the recommended standard is in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 6295(o) or 42 U.S.C. 6313(a)(6)(B) as applicable. To be "fairly representative of relevant points of view" the group submitting a joint statement must, where appropriate, include larger concerns and small businesses in the regulated industry/manufacturer community, energy advocates, energy utilities, consumers, and States. However, it will be necessary to evaluate the meaning of "fairly representative" on a case-by-case basis, subject to the circumstances of a particular rulemaking, to determine whether fewer or additional parties must be part of a joint statement in order to be "fairly representative of relevant points of view."
