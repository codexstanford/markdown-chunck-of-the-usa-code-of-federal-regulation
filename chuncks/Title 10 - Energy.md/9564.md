a. Conduct one maximum temperature test (H0), two high temperature tests (H1and H1), one frost accumulation test (H2), two low temperature tests (H3, H3), and one very low temperature test (H4). Conduct an additional frost accumulation test (H2) and low temperature test (H3) if both of the following conditions exist: (1) Knowledge of the heat pump's capacity and electrical power at low compressor capacity for outdoor temperatures of 37 &#xB0;F and less is needed to complete the section 4.2.6 seasonal performance calculations; and (2) the heat pump's controls allow low capacity operation at outdoor temperatures of 37 &#xB0;F and less. If the above two conditions are met, an alternative to conducting the H2frost accumulation test to determine(35) and E(35) is to use the following equations to approximate this capacity and electrical power:
