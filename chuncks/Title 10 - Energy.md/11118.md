####### i.e.,

3.5.1.1. With supply water temperature as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (70 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F) the water flow rate can be varied so that the outlet water temperature is constant at 70 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F above the supply water temperature, while the heating element is operating at the rated input.

3.5.1.2. After the water supply is turned off and the thermostat reduces the electricity supply to the heating element to a minimum, the maximum heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T) is 140 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F.

3.5.1.3. If the water heater includes a built-in safety mechanism that prevents it from achieving a heat exchanger outlet water temperature of 140 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F, adjust the thermostat to its maximum setting.
