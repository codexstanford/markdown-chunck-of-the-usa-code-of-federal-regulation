######## Additional IEC 60034-2-1:2014 Method 2-1-1A Torque Measurement Instructions.

(A)

If using IEC 60034-2-1:2014 Method 2-1-1A to measure motor performance, follow the instructions in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, instead of section 6.1.2.2 of IEC 60034-2-1:2014;

(B) Couple the machine under test to load machine. Measure torque using an in-line shaft-coupled, rotating torque transducer or stationary, stator reaction torque transducer. Operate the machine under test at the rated load until thermal equilibrium is achieved (rate of change 1 K or less per half hour). Record U, I, Pel, n, T, &#x3B8;c.
