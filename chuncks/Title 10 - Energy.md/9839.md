####### Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard.

(c)Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) or other requirement for a type or class of a covered product, when the Federal energy conservation standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) for such product subsequently is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the exemption rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should be withdrawn.
