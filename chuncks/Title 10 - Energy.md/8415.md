####### Residential straight-shaped lamp

means a low pressure mercury electric-discharge source in which a fluorescing coating transforms some of the ultraviolet energy generated by the mercury discharge into light, including a straight-shaped fluorescent lamp with medium bi-pin bases of nominal overall length of 48 inches and is either designed exclusively for residential applications; or designed primarily and marketed exclusively for residential applications.

(1) A lamp is designed exclusively for residential applications if it will not function for more than 100 hours with a commercial high-power-factor ballast.

(2) A lamp is designed primarily and marketed exclusively for residential applications if it:

(i) Is permanently and clearly marked as being for residential use only;

(ii) Has a life of 6,000 hours or less when used with a commercial high-power-factor ballast;

(iii) Is not labeled or represented as a replacement for a fluorescent lamp that is a covered product; and

(iv) Is marketed and distributed in a manner designed to minimize use of the lamp with commercial high-power-factor ballasts.

(3) A manufacturer may market and distribute a lamp in a manner designed to minimize use of the lamp with commercial high-power-factor ballasts by:

(i) Packaging and labeling the lamp in a manner that clearly indicates the lamp is for residential use only and includes appropriate instructions concerning proper and improper use; if the lamp is included in a catalog or price list that also includes commercial/industrial lamps, listing the lamp in a separate residential section accompanied by notes about proper use on the same page; and providing as part of any express warranty accompanying the lamp that improper use voids such warranty; or

(ii) Using other comparably effective measures to minimize use with commercial high-power-factor ballasts.
