###### Measurements.

(b)The licensee shall:

(1) Establish, maintain, and use a program for the measurement of all SNM received, produced, transferred between internal control areas, on inventory, or shipped, discarded, or otherwise removed from inventory, except for:

(i) Sealed sources that have been determined by other means to contain less than 10 grams of uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium each;

(ii) Samples received, transferred between internal control areas, or on inventory that have been determined by other means to contain less than 10 grams of uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium each;

(iii) Receipt of sealed sources, of any quantity, previously manufactured and shipped by the licensee and which are returned to the licensee, provided the unique identity and encapsulation integrity have not been compromised, and the booked receipt quantity equals the previously shipped quantity for the involved sealed sources; and

(iv) Heterogeneous scrap that cannot be accurately measured in its as received form, provided this scrap is measured after dissolution within 18 months of receipt. The after dissolution measurement must include measurement of both the resulting solution and any undissolved residues, before any co-mingling with other scrap solutions or residues.

(2) Maintain and follow a program for the development and use of written procedures that includes documented review and approval of these procedures, and any revisions thereof, before use, for:

(i) Preparing or acquiring, maintaining, storing, and using reference standards;

(ii) Calibrating measurement systems, performing bulk mass and volume measurements, conducting nondestructive assay measurements, obtaining samples, and performing laboratory analyses for element concentration and isotope abundance; and

(iii) Recording, reviewing, and reporting measurements.
