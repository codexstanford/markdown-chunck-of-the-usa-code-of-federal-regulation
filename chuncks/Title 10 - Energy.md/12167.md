##### Subpart E - Mandatory Energy Efficiency Standards for Federal Residential Buildings
###### ยง 435.500 Purpose.

(a) This subpart establishes voluntary energy conservation performance standards for new residential buildings. The voluntary energy conservation performance standards are designed to achieve the maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency and increases in the use of non-depletable sources of energy.

(b) Voluntary energy conservation performance standards prescribed under this subpart shall be developed solely as guidelines for the purpose of providing technical assistance for the design of energy conserving buildings, and shall be mandatory only for the Federal buildings for which design for construction began before January 3, 2007.

(c) The energy conservation performance standards will direct Federal policies and practices to ensure that cost-effective energy conservation features will be incorporated into the designs of all new Federal residential buildings for which design for construction began January 3, 2007.
