####### Determination of Represented Value.

(a)Each manufacturer must determine represented values, which include certified ratings, for each basic model by testing, in accordance with the following sampling provisions.

(1) Units to be tested.

(i) When testing, use a sample comprised of production units. The same sample of units must be tested and used as the basis for representations for rated wattage, average lamp efficacy, color rendering index (CRI), and correlated color temperature (CCT).

(ii) For each basic model, randomly select and test a sample of sufficient size, but not less than 10 units, to ensure that represented values of average lamp efficacy are less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The arithmetic mean of the sample: or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by .97, where:

(2) Any represented values of measures of energy efficiency or energy consumption for all individual models represented by a given basic model must be the same.

(3) Represented values of CCT, CRI and rated wattage must be equal to the arithmetic mean of the sample.
