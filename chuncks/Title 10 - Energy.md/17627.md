###### Weapons proficiency demonstration

means a process based on a predetermined, objective set of criteria approved by the respective program office in consultation with AU-1 that results in a grade (e.g., pass/fail). The process must ensure that an individual (or team, for crew-served weapons) demonstrates the ability to perform all weapons-handling and operational manipulations necessary to load, operate, and discharge a weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing/returning to safe mode the weapons system at the conclusion of firing), without the necessity for scoring targets during the course of fire. Proficiency courses of fire must include tactically-relevant time constraints. Demonstrations of proficiency are allowed with the actual weapon and assigned duty load, with alternate loads (e.g., frangible or dye-marking rounds), or with authorized weapons system simulators, as defined in this section. Proficiency courses of fire must be tactically relevant.
