(vi) In calculating the measures of energy consumption for each unit tested, use the design heating requirement corresponding to the mean of the capacities of the units of the sample.

(vii) The represented value of annual fuel utilization efficiency must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percentage point. The represented values of standby mode power and off mode power must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a watt.
