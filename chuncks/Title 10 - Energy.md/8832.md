####### Adjusted Daily Water Heating Energy Consumption.

6.3.5The adjusted daily water heating energy consumption, Q, takes into account that the ambient temperature may differ from the nominal value of 67.5 &#xB0;F (19.7 &#xB0;C) due to the allowable variation in surrounding ambient temperature of 65 &#xB0;F (18.3 &#xB0;C) to 70 &#xB0;C (21.1 &#xB0;C). The adjusted daily water heating energy consumption is computed as:

A modification is also needed to take into account that the temperature difference between the outlet water temperature and supply water temperature may not be equivalent to the nominal value of 67 &#xB0;F (125 &#xB0;F-58 &#xB0;F) or 37.3 &#xB0;C (51.7 &#xB0;C-14.4 &#xB0;C). The following equations adjust the experimental data to a nominal 67 &#xB0;F(37.3 &#xB0;C) temperature rise.

The energy used to heat water, Btu/day (kJ/day), may be computed as:

The energy required to heat the same quantity of water over a 67 &#xB0;F (37.3 &#xB0;C) temperature rise, Btu/day (kJ/day), is:

The difference between these two values is:
