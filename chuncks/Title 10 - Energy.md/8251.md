####### Commercial and industrial power supply

means a power supply that is used to convert electric current into DC or lower-voltage AC current, is not distributed in commerce for use with a consumer product, and may include any of the following characteristics:

(1) A power supply that requires 3-phase input power and that is incapable of operating on household mains electricity;

(2) A DC-DC-only power supply that is incapable of operating on household mains electricity;

(3) A power supply with a fixed, non-removable connection to an end-use device that is not a consumer product as defined under the Act;

(4) A power supply whose output connector is uniquely shaped to fit only an end-use device that is not a consumer product;

(5) A power supply that cannot be readily connected to an end-use device that is a consumer product without significant modification or customization of the power supply itself or the end-use device;

(6) A power supply packaged with an end-use device that is not a consumer product, as evidenced by either:

(i) Such device being certified as, or declared to be in conformance with, a specific standard applicable only to non-consumer products. For example, a power supply model intended for use with an end-use device that is certified to the following standards would not meet the EPCA definition of an EPS:

(A) CISPR 11 (Class A Equipment), "Industrial, scientific and medical equipment-Radio-frequency disturbance-Limits and methods of measurement";

(B) UL 1480A, "Standard for Speakers for Commercial and Professional Use";

(C) UL 813, "Standard for Commercial Audio Equipment"; and

(D) UL 1727, "Standard for Commercial Electric Personal Grooming Appliances"; or

(ii) Such device being excluded or exempted from inclusion within, or conformance with, a law, regulation, or broadly-accepted industry standard where such exclusion or exemption applies only to non-consumer products;

(7) A power supply distributed in commerce for use with an end-use device where:

(i) The end-use device is not a consumer product, as evidenced by either the circumstances in paragraph (6)(i) or (ii) of this definition; and

(ii) The end-use device for which the power supply is distributed in commerce is reasonably disclosed to the public, such as by identification of the end-use device on the packaging for the power supply, documentation physically present with the power supply, or on the manufacturer's or private labeler's public website; or

(8) A power supply that is not marketed for residential or consumer use, and that is clearly marked (or, alternatively, the packaging of the individual power supply, the shipping container of multiple such power supplies, or associated documentation physically present with the power supply when distributed in commerce is clearly marked) "FOR USE WITH COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT ONLY" or "NOT FOR RESIDENTIAL OR CONSUMER USE," with the marking designed and applied so that the marking will be visible and legible during customary conditions for the item on which the marking is placed.
