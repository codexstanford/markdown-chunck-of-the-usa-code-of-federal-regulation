###### Appendix J to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Automatic and Semi-Automatic Clothes Washers
####### Energy efficiency ratio

means the quotient of the weighted-average load size divided by the total clothes washer energy consumption per cycle, with such energy consumption expressed as the sum of:

(a) The machine electrical energy consumption;

(b) The hot water energy consumption;

(c) The energy required for removal of the remaining moisture in the wash load; and

(d) The combined low-power mode energy consumption.
