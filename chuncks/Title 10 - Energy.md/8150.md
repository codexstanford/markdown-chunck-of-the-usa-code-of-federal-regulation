####### i.e.,

(ii) If the value of nis less than or equal to zero and the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (x) is less than the lower control limit (LCL) or less than 95 percent of the applicable energy or water efficiency standard (EES), whichever is greater,if n&#x2264;0 and x&#x2264;max (LCL, 0.95 EES), the basic model is not in compliance and testing is at an end.

(iii) If the value of nis greater than zero, then, the value of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the solution value of nfor equation (6). If the value of nso calculated is greater than 21- n, set nequal to 21- n.

(4) Compute the combined mean (x) of the measured energy or water efficiency of the nand nunits of the combined first and second samples as follows:

(5) Compute the standard error (S) of the measured energy or water performance of the nand nunits in the combined first and second samples as follows:

(6) For an energy efficiency standard (EES), compute the lower control limit (LCL) for the mean of the combined first and second samples using the DOE EES as the desired mean and a one-tailed probability level of 97.5 percent (equivalent to the two-tailed probability level of 95 percent used in Step (e)(1)) as follows:

(7) For an energy efficiency standard (EES), compare the combined sample mean (x) to the lower control limit (LCL) to determine one of the following:
