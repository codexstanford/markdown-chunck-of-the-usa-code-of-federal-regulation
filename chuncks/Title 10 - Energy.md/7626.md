() For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 4 to this paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A), the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 4 included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A)() shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 4 of appendix G1 to subpart F of 10 CFR part 431.

(B) The represented value of cooling capacity must be between 95 percent and 100 percent of the mean of the capacities measured for the units in the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, or between 95 percent and 100 percent of the net sensible cooling capacity output simulated by the alternative energy-efficiency determination method (AEDM) as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(C) Represented values must be based on performance (either through testing or by applying an AEDM) of individual models with components and features that are selected in accordance with section 4 of appendix G1 to subpart F of 10 CFR part 431.
