###### Combined cycle unit.

(3)The design fuel heat input rate of a combined cycle unit (Btu/hr) shall be the summation of the product of its generator's nameplate rating, measured in kilowatts, and 3412 (Btu/kWh), divided by the overall combustion turbine-generator unit's efficiency (decimal), adjusted for peaking service at an ambient temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) and at the unit's evaluation, plus the product of the maximum fuel heat input to any supplemental heat recovery steam generator/boiler in gallons or pounds per hour and the fuel's heat content. If the generator's nameplate does not have a rating measured in kilowatts, the product of the generator's kilowatt-amperes nameplate rating and power factor nameplate rating must be substituted for kilowatts. (The number 3412 converts kilowatt-hours (absolute) into Btu's (mean).)
