####### Testing BEP for the Pump.

D.Determine the BEP of the pump as follows:

D.1. Adjust the flow by throttling the pump without changing the speed of rotation of the pump to a minimum of seven flow points: 40, 60, 75, 90, 100, 110, and 120 percent of the expected BEP flow rate of the pump at the nominal speed of rotation, as specified in HI 40.6-2014, except section 40.6.5.3, section A.7, and appendix B (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463).

D.2. Determine the BEP flow rate as the flow rate at the operating point of maximum overall efficiency on the pump efficiency curve, as determined in accordance with section 40.6.6.3 of HI 40.6-2014 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463), where overall efficiency is the ratio of the pump power output divided by the driver power input, as specified in Table 40.6.2.1 of HI 40.6-2014 and the calculations provided in section 40.6.6.2 are to be disregarded.
