###### ยง 436.33 Procedures and methods for contractor selection.
####### Competitive selection.

(a)Competitive selections based on solicitation of firms are subject to the following procedures-

(1) With respect to a particular proposed energy cost savings performance project, Federal agencies shall publish a Commerce Business Daily notice which synopsizes the proposed contract action.

(2) Each competitive solicitation-

(i) Shall request technical and price proposals and the text of any third-party financing agreement from interested firms;

(ii) Shall consider DOE model solicitations and should use them to the maximum extent practicable;

(iii) May provide for a two-step selection process which allows Federal agencies to make an initial selection based, in part, on proposals containing estimated energy cost savings and energy unit savings, with contract award conditioned on confirmation through a detailed energy survey that the guaranteed energy cost savings are within a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of the estimated amount; and

(iv) May state that if the Federal agency requires a detailed energy survey which identifies life cycle cost effective energy conservation measures not in the initial proposal, the contract may include such measures.

(3) Based on its evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted, any applicable financing agreement (including lease-acquisitions, if any), statements of qualifications submitted under ยง 436.32 of this subpart, and any other information determines to be relevant, the Federal agency may select a firm on a qualified list to conduct the project.

(4) If a proposed energy cost savings project involves a large facility with too many contiguously related buildings and other structures at one site for proposing firms to assume the costs of a preliminary energy survey of all such structures, the Federal agency-

(i) May request technical and price proposals for a representative sample of buildings and other structures and may select a firm to conduct the proposed project; and

(ii) After selection of a firm, but prior to award of an energy savings performance contract, may request the selected firm to submit technical and price proposals for all or some of the remaining buildings and other structures at the site and may include in the award for all or some of the remaining buildings and other structures.

(5) After selection under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, but prior to award, a Federal agency may require the selectee to conduct a detailed energy survey to confirm that guaranteed energy cost savings are within a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of estimated energy cost savings in the selectee's proposal. If the detailed energy survey does not confirm that guaranteed energy savings are within the fixed percentage of estimated savings, the Federal agency may select another firm from those within the competitive range.
