###### Voltage independent UPS,VI UPS

2.28.3.ormeans a UPS that produces an AC output within a specific tolerance band that is independent of under-voltage or over-voltage variations in the input voltage without depleting the stored energy source. The output frequency of a VI UPS is dependent on the input frequency, similar to a voltage and frequency dependent system.

VI input dependency may be verified by performing the steady state input voltage tolerance test in Section 6.4.1.1 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 2.0 and ensuring that the UPS remains in normal mode with the output voltage within the specified output range when the input voltage is varied by +/-10% of the rated input voltage.
