###### Test Procedures
####### ยง 431.76 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial warm air furnaces.
######## Additional test measurements,Measurement of flue CO,(carbon dioxide) for oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces.

(d)-(1)In addition to the flue temperature measurement specified in section 40.6.8 of UL 727-2006 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.75), you must locate one or two sampling tubes within six inches downstream from the flue temperature probe (as indicated on Figure 40.3 of UL 727-2006). If you use an open end tube, it must project into the flue one-third of the chimney connector diameter. If you use other methods of sampling COyou must place the sampling tube so as to obtain an average sample. There must be no air leak between the temperature probe and the sampling tube location. You must collect the flue gas sample at the same time the flue gas temperature is recorded. The COconcentration of the flue gas must be as specified by the manufacturer for the product being tested, with a tolerance of +/-0.1 percent. You must determine the flue COusing an instrument with a reading error no greater than +/-0.1 percent.
