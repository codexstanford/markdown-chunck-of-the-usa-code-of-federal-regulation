####### ยง 431.324 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency and standby mode energy consumption of metal halide lamp ballasts.
######## Test method and measurement.

(3)(i) Turn on all of the lamps at full light output. If any lamp is not functional, replace the lamp and repeat the test procedure. If the ballast will not operate any lamps, replace the unit under test.

(ii) Send a signal to the ballast instructing it to have zero light output using the appropriate ballast communication protocol or system for the ballast being tested.

(iii) Stabilize the ballast prior to measurement using one of the methods as specified in Section 5.4 of IEC 63103.

(iv) Measure the standby mode energy consumption in watts using one of the methods as specified in Section 5.4 of IEC 63103.
