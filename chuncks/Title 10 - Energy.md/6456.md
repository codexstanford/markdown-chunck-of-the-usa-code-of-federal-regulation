() Is the subject of an agreement with the United States Government to convert to an alternative nuclear reactor fuel when alternative nuclear reactor fuel can be used in the reactor.

(iii) A fuel or target "can be used" in a nuclear research or test reactor if-

(A) The fuel or target has been qualified by the Reduced Enrichment Research and Test Reactor Program of the Department of Energy; and

(B) Use of the fuel or target will permit the large majority of ongoing and planned experiments and isotope production to be conducted in the reactor without a large percentage increase in the total cost of operating the reactor.

(b) The review of license applications for the export of nuclear equipment, other than a production or utilization facility, and for deuterium for nuclear end use and nuclear grade graphite for nuclear end use is governed by the following criteria:

(1) IAEA safeguards as required by Article III (2) of the NPT will be applied with respect to such equipment or material.

(2) No such equipment or material will be used for any nuclear explosive device or for research on or development of any nuclear explosive device.

(3) No such equipment or material will be retransferred to the jurisdiction of any other country or group of countries without the prior consent of the United States.

(4) The proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and security.

(c) Except where paragraph (d) is applicable, the review of license applications for export of byproduct material or for export of source material for non-nuclear end uses requiring a specific license under this part is governed by the criterion that the proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and security.

(d) The review of license applications for the export of radioactive waste requiring a specific license under this part is governed by the following criteria:

(1) The proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and security.

(2) The receiving country, after being advised of the information required by ยง 110.32(f)(5), finds that it has the administrative and technical capacity and regulatory structure to manage and dispose of the waste and consents to the receipt of the radioactive waste. In the case of radioactive waste containing a nuclear material to which paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is applicable, the criteria in this paragraph (d) shall be in addition to the criteria provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(e) In making its findings under paragraphs (a)(8) and (c) of this section for proposed exports of radioactive material listed in Appendix P to this part, the NRC shall consider:

(1) Whether the foreign recipient is authorized based on the authorization or confirmation required by ยง 110.32(g) to receive and possess the material under the laws and regulations of the importing country;

(2) Whether the importing country has the appropriate technical and administrative capability, resources and regulatory structure to manage the material in a safe and secure manner;

(3) For proposed exports of Category 1 amounts of radioactive material listed in Table 1 of Appendix P to this part, whether the government of the importing country provides consent to the United States Government for the import of the material;

(4) In cases where the importing country does not have the technical and administrative capability described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and in cases where there is insufficient evidence of the recipient's authorization to receive and possess the material to be exported, described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, whether exceptional circumstances exist, and if so, whether the export should be licensed in light of those exceptional circumstances and the risks, if any, to the common defense and security of the proposed export;

(5) For proposed exports under exceptional circumstances of Category 1 or Category 2 amounts of radioactive material listed in Table 1 of Appendix P to this part, whether the government of the importing country provides consent to the United States Government for the import of the material;

(6) For proposed exports of radioactive material listed in Table 1 of Appendix P to this part under the exceptional circumstance in which there is a considerable health or medical need as acknowledged by the U.S. Government and the importing country, whether the United States and the importing country have, to the extent practicable, made arrangements for the safe and secure management of the radioactive sources during and at the end of their useful life;

(7) Based upon the available information, whether the foreign recipient has engaged in clandestine or illegal procurement of radioactive material listed in Table 1 of Appendix P to the part;

(8) Based upon available information, whether an import or export authorization for radioactive material listed in Table 1 of Appendix P to this part has been denied to the recipient or importing country, or whether the recipient or importing country has diverted any import or export of radioactive material previously authorized; and

(9) Based upon available information, whether there is a risk of diversion or malicious acts involving radioactive material in Table 1 of Appendix P to this part.
