####### [object Object],[object Object],[object Object]

In preparation for determining the energy consumed during standby, record the reading given on the electrical energy (watt-hour) meter, the gas meter, and/or the scale used to determine oil consumption, as appropriate. Record the mean tank temperature at the start of the standby period as. At 1-minute intervals, record the mean tank temperature and the electric and/or fuel instrument readings until the next draw is initiated. Just prior to initiation of the next draw, record the mean tank temperature as. If the water heater is undergoing recovery when the next draw is initiated, record the mean tank temperatureat the minute prior to the start of the recovery. The time at which this value occurs is the end of the standby period. Determine the total electrical energy and/or fossil fuel energy consumption from the beginning of the test to this time and record as Q. Record the time interval between the start of the standby period and the end of the standby period as θ. Record the time during which water is not being withdrawn from the water heater during the entire 24-hour period as θ.
