###### SPO maintenance training.

(2)In addition to meeting the SO maintenance training requirements described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each SPO must successfully complete an annual course of maintenance training to maintain the minimum level of competency required for the successful performance of essential functions and tasks associated with SPO job responsibilities. The type and intensity of training must be determined by a site-specific JA or METL. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SPO being placed in a remedial training program. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SPO with necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the JA or METL within clearly established time frames. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SPO status.
