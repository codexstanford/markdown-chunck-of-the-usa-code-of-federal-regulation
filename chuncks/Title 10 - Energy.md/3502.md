(iii)means the margin to be added to account for uncertainties in the values of RT, copper and nickel contents, fluence and the calculational procedures. M is evaluated from Equation 2.

(A) In Equation 2, &#x3C3;is the standard deviation for RT. If a measured value of RTis used, then &#x3C3;is determined from the precision of the test method. If a measured value of RTis not available and a generic mean value for that class of materials is used, then &#x3C3;is the standard deviation obtained from the set of data used to establish the mean. If a generic mean value given in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section for welds is used, then &#x3C3;is 17 &#xB0;F.

(B) In Equation 2, &#x3C3;is the standard deviation for ΔRT. The value of &#x3C3;to be used is 28 &#xB0;F for welds and 17 &#xB0;F for base metal; the value of &#x3C3;need not exceed one-half of ΔRT.

(iv) ΔRTis the mean value of the transition temperature shift, or change in RT, due to irradiation, and must be calculated using Equation 3.
