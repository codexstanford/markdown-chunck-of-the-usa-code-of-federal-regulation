2.The frictional losses in pipes and other components including the reactor core shall be calculated using models that include realistic variation of friction factor with Reynolds number, and realistic two-phase friction multipliers that have been adequately verified by comparison with experimental data, or models that prove at least equally conservative with respect to maximum clad temperature calculated during the hypothetical accident. The modified Baroczy correlation (Baroczy, C. J., "A Systematic Correlation for Two-Phase Pressure Drop,"No. 64, Vol. 62, 1965) or a combination of the Thom correlation (Thom, J.R.S., "Prediction of Pressure Drop During Forced Circulation Boiling of Water,"7, 709-724, 1964) for pressures equal to or greater than 250 psia and the Martinelli-Nelson correlation (Martinelli, R. C. Nelson, D.B., "Prediction of Pressure Drop During Forced Circulation Boiling of Water,"695-702, 1948) for pressures lower than 250 psia is acceptable as a basis for calculating realistic two-phase friction multipliers.
