###### Baseline design criteria.

(a)Each prospective applicant or licensee shall address the following baseline design criteria in the design of new facilities. Each existing licensee shall address the following baseline design criteria in the design of new processes at existing facilities that require a license amendment under ยง 70.72. The baseline design criteria must be applied to the design of new facilities and new processes, but do not require retrofits to existing facilities or existing processes (e.g., those housing or adjacent to the new process); however, all facilities and processes must comply with the performance requirements in ยง 70.61. Licensees shall maintain the application of these criteria unless the analysis performed pursuant to ยง 70.62(c) demonstrates that a given item is not relied on for safety or does not require adherence to the specified criteria.
