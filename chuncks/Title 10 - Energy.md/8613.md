####### Water consumption.

4.1

The water consumption requirements described in section 4.1.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line. For such dishwashers these water consumption measurement requirements do not apply and water consumption, V, is the value reported by the manufacturer.

The calculations in section 5.1 through 5.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020 apply to this test procedure. The following additional requirements are also applicable:

(a) In sections 5.1.3, 5.1.4, 5.1.5, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, 5.4.5, and 5.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use N = 215 cycles/year in place of N = 184 cycles/year.

(b) In section 5.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use S= 8,465 for dishwashers that are not capable of operating in fan-only mode.

(c) For dishwashers that do not have a direct water line, water consumption is equal to the volume of water use in the test cycle, as specified by the manufacturer.

(d) In sections 5.6.1.3, 5.6.1.4, 5.6.2.3, and 5.6.2.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use (C/e) in place of K.
