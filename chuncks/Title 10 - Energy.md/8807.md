####### General.

5.3.3.1During hot water draws for water heaters with rated storage volumes greater than or equal to 20 gallons, remove water at a rate of 3.0 +/-0.25 gallons per minute (11.4 +/-0.95 liters per minute). During hot water draws for storage-type water heaters with rated storage volumes below 20 gallons, remove water at a rate of 1.0 +/-0.25 gallon per minute (3.8 +/-0.95 liters per minute). Collect the water in a container that is large enough to hold the volume removed during an individual draw and is suitable for weighing at the termination of each draw to determine the total volume of water withdrawn. As an alternative to collecting the water, a water meter may be used to directly measure the water volume(s) withdrawn.
