####### ยง 431.134 Uniform test methods for the measurement of harvest rate, energy consumption, and water consumption of automatic commercial ice makers.
######## Continuous type automatic commercial ice makers,Ice hardness adjustment,Calorimeter constant.

(h)-(1)-(i)Determine the calorimeter constant according to the requirements in section A1 and A2 of Normative Annex A Method of Calorimetry in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the trials shall be conducted at an ambient air temperature (room temperature) of 70 &#xB0;F +/- 1 &#xB0;F, with an initial water temperature of 90 &#xB0;F +/- 1 &#xB0;F. To verify the temperature of the block of pure ice as provided in section A2.e in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, a thermocouple shall be embedded at approximately the geometric center of the interior of the block. Any water that remains on the block of ice shall be wiped off the surface of the block before being placed into the calorimeter.
