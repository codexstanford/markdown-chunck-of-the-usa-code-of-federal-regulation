####### Condensate Pan Heaters and Pumps.

2.2.3.5.All electric resistance condensate heaters and condensate pumps must be installed and operational during the test. Prior to the start of the test, including the 24 hour period used to determine temperature stabilization, as described in ANSI/ASHRAE 32.1 section 7.2.2.2 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.293), the condensate pan must be dry. For the duration of the test, including the 24 hour time period necessary for temperature stabilization, allow any condensate moisture generated to accumulate in the pan. Do not manually add or remove water from the condensate pan at any time during the test.
