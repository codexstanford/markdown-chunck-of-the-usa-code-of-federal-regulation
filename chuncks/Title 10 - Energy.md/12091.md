####### Hydronic System Balancing.

403.2.10.4Hydronic systems shall be balanced in a manner to first minimize throttling losses; then the pump impeller shall be trimmed or pump speed shall be adjusted to meet design flow conditions. Exceptions are as follows:

(a) Pumps with pump motors of 10 hp (7.46 kW) or less.

(b) If throttling results in no greater than 3 hp (2.23 kW) pump horsepower draw above that required if the impeller were trimmed.

(c) To reserve additional pump pressure capability in open circuit piping systems subject to fouling. Valve throttling pressure drop shall not exceed that expected for future fouling.
