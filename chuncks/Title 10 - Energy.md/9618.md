As specified in section 4.2.3.1 of this appendix. Except now use Equations 4.2.4-1 and 4.2.4-2 (for heat pumps that are not minimum-speed-limiting and are not variable-speed non-communicating coil-only heat pumps), Equations 4.2.4-1, 4.2.4-2, 4.2.4-3, and 4.2.4-4 as appropriate (for variable-speed non-communicating coil-only heat pumps), or Equations 4.2.4-5 and 4.2.4.-6 (for minimum-speed-limiting variable-speed heat pumps that are not variable-speed non-communicating coil-only heat pumps) to this appendix to evaluate(T) and(T), respectively, and replace section 4.2.3.1 references to "low capacity" and section 3.6.3 of this appendix with "minimum speed" and section 3.6.4 of this appendix.

For units that are not variable-speed non-communicating coil-only heat pumps, calculate:
