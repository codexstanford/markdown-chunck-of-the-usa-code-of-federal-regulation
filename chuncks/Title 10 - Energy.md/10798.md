####### General.

2.3.1.Conduct the thermal efficiency test as prescribed in Section C4 "Test Procedure" of Appendix C of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.85) excluding sections:

2.3.1.1. Adjust oil or non-atmospheric gas to produce the required firebox pressure and COor Oconcentration in the flue gas, as described in Section 5.3.1 of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015. Conduct steam tests with steam pressure at the pressure specified in the manufacturer literature shipped with the commercial packaged boiler or in the manufacturer's supplemental testing instructions pursuant to ยง 429.60(b)(4) of this chapter, but not exceeding 15 psig. If no pressure is specified in the manufacturer literature shipped with the commercial packaged boiler or in the manufacturer's supplemental testing instructions (pursuant to ยง 429.60(b)(4) of this chapter), or if a range of operating pressures is specified, conduct testing at a steam pressure equal to atmospheric pressure. If necessary to maintain steam quality as required by Section 5.3.7 of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015, increase steam pressure in 1 psig increments by throttling with a valve beyond the separator until the test is completed and the steam quality requirements have been satisfied, but do not increase the steam pressure to greater than 15 psig.
