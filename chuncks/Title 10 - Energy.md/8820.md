In the event that the recovery period continues from the end of the last draw of the first draw cluster until the subsequent draw, the standby period will start after the end of the first recovery period after the last draw of the simulated-use test, when the temperature reaches the maximum average tank temperature, though no sooner than five minutes after the end of this recovery period. The standby period shall last eight hours, so testing will extend beyond the 24-hour duration of the simulated-use test. Determine and record the total electrical energy and/or fossil fuel consumed from the beginning of the simulated-use test to the start of the 8-hour standby period, Q. In preparation for determining the energy consumed during standby, record the reading(s) given on the electrical energy (watt-hour) meter, the gas meter, and/or the scale used to determine oil consumption, as appropriate. Record the mean tank temperature at the start of the standby period as. Record the mean tank temperature, the ambient temperature, and the electric and/or fuel instrument readings until the end of the 8 hour period. Record the mean tank temperature at the end of the 8 hour standby period as. If the water heater is undergoing recovery at the end of the standby period, record the mean tank temperatureat the minute prior to the start of the recovery, which will mark the end of the standby period. Determine the total electrical energy and/or fossil fuel energy consumption from the beginning of the test to the end of the standby period and record this value as Q. Record the time interval between the start of the standby period and the end of the standby period as Î¸.
