###### Calculation of RT

(c). RTmust be calculated for each vessel beltline material using a fluence value, f, which is the EOL fluence for the material. RTmust be evaluated using the same procedures used to calculate RT, as indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.

(1) Equation 1 must be used to calculate values of RTfor each weld and plate, or forging, in the reactor vessel beltline.

(i) If a measured value of RTis not available, a generic mean value for the classof material may be used if there are sufficient test results to establish a mean and a standard deviation for the class.

(ii) For generic values of weld metal, the following generic mean values must be used unless justification for different values is provided: 0 &#xB0;F for welds made with Linde 80 flux, and -56 &#xB0;F for welds made with Linde 0091, 1092 and 124 and ARCOS B-5 weld fluxes.
