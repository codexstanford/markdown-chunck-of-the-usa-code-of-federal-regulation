##### ยง 1008.7 Processing of requests.

(a) Receipt of a request made in accordance with ยง 1008.6 shall be promptly acknowledged by the Privacy Act Officer.

(b) Each request shall be acted upon promptly. Every effort will be made to respond within ten working days of the date of receipt by the System Manager or designee. If a response cannot be made within ten working days, the appropriate Privacy Act Officer shall send an interim response providing information on the status of the request, including an estimate of the time within which action is expected to be taken on the request and asking for any further information as may be necessary to respond to the request. Action will be completed as soon as possible, but not later than 20 working days after receipt of the original specific inquiry. In unusual circumstances and for good cause, the appropriate Privacy Act Officer may decide that action cannot be completed within the initial 20 working days. In such case, the appropriate Privacy Act Officer will advise the individual of the reason for the delay and the date (not to exceed an additional 20 working days) by which action can be expected to be completed.
