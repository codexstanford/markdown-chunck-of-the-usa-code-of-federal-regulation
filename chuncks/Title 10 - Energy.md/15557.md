##### ยง 850.35 Medical removal.
###### Return to work after medical removal.

(4)(i) The responsible employer, subject to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, must not return a beryllium-associated worker who has been permanently removed under this section to the worker's former job status unless the SOMD first determines in a written medical opinion that continued medical removal is no longer necessary to protect the worker's health.

(ii) Not withstanding paragraph (a)(4) (i) of this section, if, in the SOMD's opinion, continued exposure to beryllium will not pose an increased risk to the beryllium-associated worker's health, and medical removal is an inappropriate remedy in the circumstances, the SOMD must fully discuss these matters with the worker and then, in a written determination, may authorize the responsible employer to return the worker to his or her former job status. Thereafter, the returned beryllium-associated worker must continue to be provided with medical surveillance under ยง 850.34 of this part.
