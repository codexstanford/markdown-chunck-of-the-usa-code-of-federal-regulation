###### i.e.,

(a) Connect the UUT to mains power and place it in no-battery mode by ensuring there are no foreign objects on the charging surface (without any load).

(b) Monitor the AC input power for a period of 5 minutes to assess the stability of the UUT. If the power level does not drift by more than 1percent from the maximum value observed, the UUT is considered stable.

(c) If the AC input power is not stable, follow the specifications in Section 5.3.3. of IEC 62301 for measuring average power or accumulated energy over time for the input. If the UUT is stable, record the measurements of the AC input power over a 5-minute period.

(d) Power consumption calculation. The power consumption of the no-battery mode is equal to the active AC input power (W).
