####### Evidence required in support of a petition.

(b)The petition must include the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:

(1) Where the petitioner has applied for a construction permit from EPA or an appropriate State agency prior to petitioning for an exemption under this section, a copy of that application and synopsis of supporting documents filed with or subsequent to that application must be submitted to OFE with the petition or at the time filed with the permitting agency;

(2) To the extent applicable, a copy of the EPA or State denial of the construction permit application;

(3) To the extent applicable, a synopsis of the administrative record of the EPA or State or local permit proceedings;

(4) To the extent applicable, a summary of the technology upon which the denial was based, including a performance comparison between the proposed technology and that technology which would provide the maximum possible reduction of pollution;

(5) An examination of the environmental compliance of the facility, including an analysis of its ability to meet applicable standards and criteria when using both the proposed fuel and the alternate fuel(s) which would provide the basis for exemption. All such analysis must be based on accepted analytical techniques, such as air quality modeling, and reflect current conditions of the area which would be affected by the facility. The petitioner is responsible for obtaining the necessary data to accurately characterize these conditions. Environmental compliance must be examined in the context of available pollution control equipment which would provide the maximum possible reduction of pollution. The analysis must contain: (i) Requests for bids and other inquiries made and responses received by the petitioner concerning the availability and performance of pollution control equipment; (ii) contracts signed, if any, for an alternate fuel supply and for the purchase and installation of pollution control equipment; or (iii) other comparable evidence such as technical studies documenting the efficacy of equipment to meet applicable requirements;

(6) An examination of any regulatory options available to the petitioner in seeking to achieve environmental compliance (such as offsets, variances, and State Implementation Plan revisions);

(7) Any other documentation which demonstrates an inability to comply with applicable environmental requirements;

(8) No alternate power supply exists, as required under ยง 503.8 of these regulations.
