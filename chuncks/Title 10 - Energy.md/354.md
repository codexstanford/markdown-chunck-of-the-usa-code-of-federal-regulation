###### Circulated draft

means a nonfinal document circulated for supervisory concurrence or signature in which the original author or others in the concurrence process have non-concurred. A "circulated draft" meeting the above criterion includes a draft of a document that eventually becomes a final document, and a draft of a document that does not become a final document due to either a decision not to finalize the document or the passage of a substantial period of time in which no action has been taken on the document.
