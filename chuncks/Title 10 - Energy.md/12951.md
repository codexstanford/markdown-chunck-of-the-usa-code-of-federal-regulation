(2) OFE will notify each petitioner in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the petition that it has been accepted or rejected and, if rejected, the reasons therefor.

(3) A petition, including supporting documents, will be accepted if the information contained appears to be sufficient to support an OFE determination.

(4) Acceptance of petition does not constitute a determination that the requested exemption will be granted.
