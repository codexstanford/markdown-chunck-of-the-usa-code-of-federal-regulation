####### Energy conservation measure

means an installation or modification of an installation in a building which is primarily intended to maintain (in the case of load management systems) or reduce energy consumption and reduce energy costs, or allow the use of an alternative energy source, including, but not limited to:

(1) Insulation of the building structure and systems within the building;

(2) Storm windows and doors, multiglazed windows and doors, heat-absorbing or heat-reflective glazed and coated windows and door systems, additional glazing, reductions in glass area, and other window and door systems modifications;

(3) Automatic energy control systems which would reduce energy consumption;

(4) Load management systems which would shift demand for energy from peak hours to hours of low demand and lower cost;

(5) Equipment required to operate variable steam, hydraulic, and ventilating systems adjusted by automatic energy control systems;

(6) Active or passive solar space heating or cooling systems, solar electric generating systems, or any combination thereof;

(7) Active or passive solar water heating systems;

(8) Furnace or utility plant and distribution system modifications including:

(i) Replacement burners, furnaces, boilers, or any combination thereof which substantially increase the energy efficiency of the heating system;

(ii) Devices for modifying flue openings which will increase the energy efficiency of the heating system;

(iii) Electrical or mechanical furnace ignition systems which replace standing gas pilot lights; and

(iv) Utility plant system conversion measures including conversion of existing oil- and gas-fired boiler installations to alternative energy sources;

(9) Addition of caulking and weatherstripping;

(10) Replacement or modification of lighting fixtures (including exterior light fixtures which are physically attached to, or connected to, the building) to increase the energy efficiency of the lighting system without increasing the overall illumination of a facility, unless such increase in illumination is necessary to conform to any applicable State or local building code or, if no such code applies, the increase is considered appropriate by DOE;

(11) Energy recovery systems;

(12) Cogeneration systems which produce steam or forms of energy such as heat as well as electricity for use primarily within a building or a complex of buildings owned by an eligible institution and which meet such fuel efficiency requirements as DOE may by rule prescribe;

(13) Such other measures as DOE identifies by rule for purposes of this part as set forth in subpart D of 10 CFR part 450; and

(14) Such other measures as a grant applicant shows will save a substantial amount of energy and as are identified in an energy audit or energy use evaluation in accordance with ยง 455.20(k) or a technical assistance report in accordance with ยง 455.62.
