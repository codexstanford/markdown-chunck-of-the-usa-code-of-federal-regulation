####### Propane gas supply.

1.4.3For an unvented gas heater utilizing propane, maintain the gas supply to the heater with a normal inlet test pressure immediately ahead of all controls at 11 to 13 inches of water column. The regulator outlet pressure at normal supply test pressure shall be that recommended by the manufacturer. The propane supplied should have a higher heating value of within+/-5 percent of 2,500 Btu's per standard cubic foot. Determine the higher heating value in Btu's per standard foot, for the propane to be used in the test, with an error no greater than one percent. Alternatively, the test can be conducted using "bottled" propane of a higher heating value within +/-5 percent of 2,500 Btu's per standard cubic foot as long as the actual higher heating value of the bottled propane has been determined with an error no greater than one percent as certified by the supplier.
