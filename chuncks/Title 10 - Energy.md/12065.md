####### Ventilation and Fan System Design.

403.2.4Ventilation systems shall be designed to be capable of reducing the supply of outdoor air to the minimum ventilation rates required by Section 6.1.3 of RS-41 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 434.701) through the use of return ducts, manually or automatically operated control dampers, fan volume controls, or other devices. Exceptions are as follows: Minimum outdoor air rates may be greater if:

(a) Required to make up air exhausted for source control of contaminants such as in a fume hood.

(b) Required by process systems.

(c) Required to maintain a slightly positive building pressure. For this purpose, minimum outside air intake may be increased up to no greater than 0.30 air changes per hour in excess of exhaust quantities.
