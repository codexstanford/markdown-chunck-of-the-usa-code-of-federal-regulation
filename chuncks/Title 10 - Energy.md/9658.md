####### Oil burner.

7.4Adjust the burners of oil-fired furnaces to give a COreading specified in the I&O manual and an hourly Btu input during the steady-state performance test described in section 8 of this appendix. Ensure the hourly BTU input is within +/-2% of the normal hourly Btu input rating as specified in the I&O manual. Smoke in the flue may not exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156R13). Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance test at the value specified in the I&O manual. Do not allow draft fluctuations exceeding 0.005 in. water. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test are described in section 6 of this appendix and shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE 103-1993.
