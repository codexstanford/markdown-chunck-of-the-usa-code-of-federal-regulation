3.2.2.

(1) Make sure the transformer power is off. Hang the ceiling fan to be tested directly from the ceiling, according to the manufacturer's installation instructions. Hang all non-multi-mount ceiling fans in the fan configuration that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades. Hang and test multi-mount fans in two configurations: The configuration associated the definition of a standard fan that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades and the configuration associated with the definition of a hugger fan that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades. For all tested configurations, measure the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blade using an instrument with a measurement resolution of at least 0.25 inches. Round the measured distance from the ceiling to the lowest point of the fan blade to the nearest quarter inch.
