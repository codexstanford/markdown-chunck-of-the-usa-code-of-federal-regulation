###### Physical controls.

(b)One or more of the following features shall be used for each entrance or access point to a high radiation area where radiation levels exist such that an individual could exceed an equivalent dose to the whole body of 1 rem (0.01 sievert) in any one hour at 30 centimeters from the source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates:

(1) A control device that prevents entry to the area when high radiation levels exist or upon entry causes the radiation level to be reduced below that level defining a high radiation area;

(2) A device that functions automatically to prevent use or operation of the radiation source or field while individuals are in the area;

(3) A control device that energizes a conspicuous visible or audible alarm signal so that the individual entering the high radiation area and the supervisor of the activity are made aware of the entry;

(4) Entryways that are locked. During periods when access to the area is required, positive control over each entry is maintained;

(5) Continuous direct or electronic surveillance that is capable of preventing unauthorized entry;

(6) A control device that will automatically generate audible and visual alarm signals to alert personnel in the area before use or operation of the radiation source and in sufficient time to permit evacuation of the area or activation of a secondary control device that will prevent use or operation of the source.
