####### e.g.,

A.3 Section IV of this appendix addresses the testing-based approach for pumps sold with motors, which is applicable to all pumps sold with electric motors, including single-phase induction motors. This test procedure also applies to pumps sold with controls other than continuous or non-continuous controls (on/off switches).

A.4 Section V of this appendix addresses the calculation-based approach for pumps sold with motors, which applies to:

(1) Pumps sold with polyphase electric motors regulated by DOE's energy conservation standards for electric motors at ยง 431.25(g), and

(2) Pumps sold with submersible motors.

A.5 Section VI of this appendix addresses the testing-based approach for pumps sold with motors and controls, which is applicable to all pumps sold with electric motors (including single-phase induction motors) and continuous or non-continuous controls.

A.6 Section VII of this appendix discusses the calculation-based approach for pumps sold with motors and controls, which applies to:

(1) Pumps sold with polyphase electric motors regulated by DOE's energy conservation standards for electric motors at ยง 431.25(g) and continuous controls and

(2) Pumps sold with submersible motors and continuous controls.
