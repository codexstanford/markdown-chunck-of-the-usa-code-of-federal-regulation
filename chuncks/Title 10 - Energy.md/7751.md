####### Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.

(a)(1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to portable air conditioners; and

(2) For each basic model of portable air conditioner, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that-

(i) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values is greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample:

Or,

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10:

And,

(ii) Any represented value of the combined energy efficiency ratio or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values is less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample:

Or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.90:

And,

(3) The value of seasonally adjusted cooling capacity of a basic model must be the mean of the seasonally adjusted cooling capacities for each tested unit of the basic model. Round the mean seasonally adjusted cooling capacity value to the nearest 50, 100, 200, or 500 Btu/h, depending on the magnitude of the calculated seasonally adjusted cooling capacity, in accordance with Table 1 of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015, (incorporated by reference, see ยง 429.4), "Multiples for reporting Dual Duct Cooling Capacity, Single Duct Cooling Capacity, Spot Cooling Capacity, Water Cooled Condenser Capacity and Power Input Ratings."

(4) Round the value of combined energy efficiency ratio of a basic model to the nearest 0.1 Btu/Wh.

(5) Single-duct and dual-duct portable air conditioners distributed in commerce by the manufacturer with multiple duct configuration options that meet DOE's definitions for single-duct portable AC and dual-duct portable AC, must be rated and certified under both applicable duct configurations.
