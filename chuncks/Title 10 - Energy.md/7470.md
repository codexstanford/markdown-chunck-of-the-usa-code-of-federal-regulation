####### C

(i) For heat pumps, whether the optional tests were conducted to determine thevalue or whether the default value was used; and the maximum time between defrosts as allowed by the controls (in hours);

(ii) For multi-split, multiple-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems, the number of indoor units tested with the outdoor unit; the nominal cooling capacity of each indoor unit and outdoor unit in the combination; and the indoor units that are not providing heating or cooling for part-load tests;

(iii) For ducted systems having multiple indoor fans within a single indoor unit, the number of indoor fans; the nominal cooling capacity of the indoor unit and outdoor unit; which fan(s) operate to attain the full-load air volume rate when controls limit the simultaneous operation of all fans within the single indoor unit; and the allocation of the full-load air volume rate to each operational fan when different capacity blowers are connected to the common duct;

(iv) For blower coil systems, the airflow-control settings associated with full load cooling operation; and the airflow-control settings or alternative instructions for setting fan speed to the speed upon which the rating is based;

(v) For models with time-adaptive defrost control, the frosting interval to be used during Frost Accumulation tests and the procedure for manually initiating the defrost at the specified time;

(vi) For models of indoor units designed for both horizontal and vertical installation or for both up-flow and down-flow vertical installations, the orientation used for testing;

(vii) For variable-speed models, the compressor frequency set points, and the required dip switch/control settings for step or variable components;

(viii) For variable-speed heat pumps, whether the H1or H1test speed is the same as the H3test speed; the compressor frequency that corresponds to maximum speed at which the system controls would operate the compressor in normal operation in a 17 &#xB0;F ambient temperature; and when certifying compliance with January 1, 2023, energy conservation standards, whether the optional 5 &#xB0;F very low temperature heating mode test was used to characterize performance at temperatures below 17 &#xB0;F (except for triple-capacity northern heat pumps, for which the very low temperature test is required,) and whether the alternative test required for minimum-speed-limiting variable-speed heat pumps was used;

(ix) For models of outdoor units with no match, the following characteristics of the indoor coil: The face area, the coil depth in the direction of airflow, the fin density (fins per inch), the fin material, the fin style, the tube diameter, the tube material, and the numbers of tubes high and deep; and

(x) For central air conditioners and heat pumps that have two-capacity compressors that lock out low capacity operation for cooling at higher outdoor temperatures and/or heating at lower outdoor temperatures, the outdoor temperature(s) at which the unit locks out low capacity operation.
