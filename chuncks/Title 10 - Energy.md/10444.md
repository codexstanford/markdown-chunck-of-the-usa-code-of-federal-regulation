5.3Calculate the annual energy consumption in each operating mode, AEC, expressed in kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/year). Use the following annual hours of operation for each mode:

m represents the operating mode ("95" and "83" cooling mode at the 95 &#xB0;F and 83 &#xB0;F dry-bulb outdoor conditions, respectively for dual-duct portable air conditioners, "SD" cooling mode for single-duct portable air conditioners, "oc" off-cycle, and "ia" inactive or "om" off mode).

Total annual energy consumption in all modes except cooling, is calculated according to:

m represents the operating modes included in AEC("oc" off-cycle, and "im" inactive or "om" off mode).
