(2) For the sensors between sensor 1 and the last sensor used in the measurement, the effective area has a width of 4 inches. If a sensor is a distancein inches, from sensor 1, then the effective area is:

(3) For the last sensor, the width of the effective area depends on the horizontal displacement between the last sensor and the point on the ceiling fan blades furthest radially from the center of the fan. The total area included in an airflow calculation is the area of a circle 8 inches larger in diameter than the ceiling fan blade span (as specified in section 3 of this appendix).

Therefore, for example, for a 42-inch ceiling fan, the last sensor is 3 inches beyond the end of the ceiling fan blades. Because only the area within 4 inches of the end of the ceiling fan blades is included in the airflow calculation, the effective width of the circle corresponding to the last sensor would be 3 inches. The calculation for the effective area corresponding to the last sensor would then be:

For a 46-inch ceiling fan, the effective area of the last sensor would have a width of 5 inches, and the effective area would be:

4.2 Calculation of airflow and efficiency for small-diameter ceiling fans other than high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:

Calculate fan airflow using the overall average of both sets of air velocity measurements at each sensor position from the successive sets of measurements that meet the stability criteria from section 3.3 of this appendix. To calculate airflow for HSSD, LSSD, and VSD ceiling fans, multiply the overall average air velocity at each sensor position from section 3.3 (for high speed for HSSD, LSSD, and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD ceiling fan; and repeated for low speed only for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD ceiling fan) by that sensor's effective area (see section 4.1 of this appendix), and then sum the products to obtain the overall calculated airflow at the tested speed.

For each speed, using the overall calculated airflow and the overall average power consumption measurements from the successive sets of measurements as follows:

Calculate two ceiling fan efficiencies for multi-mount ceiling fans: One efficiency corresponds to the ceiling fan mounted in the configuration associated with the definition of a hugger ceiling fan, and the other efficiency corresponds to the ceiling fan mounted in the configuration associated with the definition of a standard ceiling fan.

4.3 Calculation of airflow and efficiency for multi-head ceiling fans:

Calculate airflow for each fan head using the method described in section 4.2 of this appendix. To calculate overall airflow at a given speed for a multi-head ceiling fan, sum the airflow for each fan head included in the ceiling fan (a single airflow can be applied to each of the identical fan heads, but at least one of each unique fan head must be tested). The power consumption is the measured power consumption with all fan heads on. Using the airflow as described in this section, and power consumption measurements from section 3.3 of this appendix, calculate ceiling fan efficiency for a multi-head ceiling fan as follows:

Calculate CFEI, which is the FEI for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans, at the speeds specified in section 3.5 of this appendix according to AMCA 208-18, with the following modifications:

(1) Using an Airflow Constant (Q) of 26,500 cubic feet per minute;

(2) Using a Pressure Constant (P) of 0.0027 inches water gauge; and

(3) Using a Fan Efficiency Constant (&#x3B7;) of 42 percent.
