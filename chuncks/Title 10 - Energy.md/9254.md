3.2.6.2.2Conduct four tests on clothes washers with user-adjustable adaptive water fill controls. Conduct the first test using the maximum test load and with the adaptive water fill control system set in the setting that uses the most water. Conduct the second test using the minimum test load and with the adaptive water fill control system set in the setting that uses the least water. Conduct the third test using the average test load and with the adaptive water fill control system set in the setting that uses the most water. Conduct the fourth test using the average test load and with the adaptive water fill control system set in the setting that uses the least water. Average the results of the third and fourth tests to obtain the energy and water consumption values for the average test load size.
