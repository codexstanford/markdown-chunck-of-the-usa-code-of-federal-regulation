2.2.3.(a) All standard components that would be used during normal operation of the model in the field and are necessary to provide sufficient functionality for cooling and vending products in field installations (product inventory, temperature management, product merchandising (including,lighting or signage), product selection, and product transport and delivery) shall be in place during testing and shall be set to the maximum energy-consuming setting if manually adjustable, except that the specific components and accessories listed in the subsequent sections shall be operated as stated. Components not necessary for the inventory, temperature management, product merchandising (lighting or signage), product selection, and or product transport and delivery shall be de-energized. If systems not required for the primary functionality of the machine as stated in this section cannot be de-energized without preventing the operation of the machine, then they shall be placed in the lowest energy consuming state.

(b) Instead of testing pursuant to section 7.2.2.4 of ANSI/ASHRAE 32.1 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.293), provide, if necessary, any physical stimuli or other input to the machine needed to prevent automatic activation of energy management systems that can be adjusted by the machine operator during the test period. Automatic energy management systems that cannot be adjusted by the machine operator may be enabled, as specified by section 7.2.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 32.1.
