If the unit alternates between high (k=2) and low (k=1) compressor capacity to satisfy the building cooling load at temperature T,(T) < BL(T) <(T).

4.1.4.3 Unit must operate continuously at full (k=2) compressor speed at temperature Tj, BL(T) â‰¥ Q(T). Evaluate the Equation 4.1-1 quantities

Calculate SEER2 using Eq. 4.1-1, where q(Tj)/N and e(Tj)/N are evaluated as specified in the applicable subsection.
