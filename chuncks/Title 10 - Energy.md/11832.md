E.3.1 Determine the pump power output at any load pointusing the following equation:

E.3.1.1 Determine the rated hydraulic horsepower as the pump power output measured on the reference curve at maximum rotating speed and full impeller diameter for the rated pump.

E.3.2 For dedicated-purpose pool pumps with single-phase AC motors or DC motors, determine the dedicated-purpose pool pump nominal motor horsepower as the product of the measured full load speed and torque, adjusted to the appropriate units, as shown in the following equation:

Full-load speed and torque shall be determined based on the maximum continuous duty motor power output rating allowable for the motor's nameplate ambient rating and insulation class.

E.3.2.1 For single-phase AC motors, determine the measured speed and torque at full load according to either section E.3.2.1.1 or E.3.2.1.2 of this appendix.

E.3.2.1.1 Use the procedures in section 3.2, "Tests with load"; section 4 "Testing facilities"; section 5.2 "Mechanical measurements"; section 5.3 "Temperature measurements"; and section 6 "Tests" of IEEE 114-2010 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463), or

E.3.2.1.2 Use the applicable procedures in section 5, "General test requirements" and section 6, "Tests" of CSA C747-2009 (RA 2014); except in section 6.4(b) the conversion factor shall be 5252, only measurements at full load are required in section 6.5, and section 6.6 shall be disregarded (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463).

E.3.2.2 For DC motors, determine the measured speed and torque at full load according to either section E.3.2.2.1 or E.3.2.2.2 of this appendix.

E.3.2.2.1 Use the procedures in section 3.1, "Instrument Selection Factors"; section 3.4 "Power Measurement": Section 3.5 "Power Sources"; section 4.1.2 "Ambient Air"; section 4.1.4 "Direction of Rotation"; section 5.4.1 "Reference Conditions"; and section 5.4.3.2 "Dynomometer or Torquemeter Method" of IEEE 113-1985 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463), or

E.3.2.2.2 Use the applicable procedures in section 5, "General test requirements" and section 6, "Tests" of CSA C747-2009 (RA 2014); except in section 6.4(b) the conversion factor shall be 5252, only measurements at full load are required in section 6.5, and section 6.6 shall be disregarded (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463).

E.3.3 For dedicated-purpose pool pumps with single-phase AC motors or DC motors, the dedicated-purpose pool pump service factor is equal to 1.0.

E.3.4 Determine the dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower according to section E.3.4.1 of this appendix for dedicated-purpose pool pumps with single-phase AC motors or DC motors and section E.3.4.2 of this appendix for dedicated-purpose pool pumps with polyphase AC motors.

E.3.4.1 For dedicated-purpose pool pumps with single-phase AC motors or DC motors, determine the dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower as the product of the dedicated-purpose pool pump nominal motor horsepower, determined in accordance with section E.3.2 of this appendix, and the dedicated-purpose pool pump service factor, determined in accordance with section E.3.3 of this appendix.

E.3.4.2 For dedicated-purpose pool pumps with polyphase AC induction motors, determine the dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower as the product of the rated nominal motor horsepower and the rated service factor of the motor.
