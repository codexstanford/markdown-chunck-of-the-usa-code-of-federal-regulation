###### 2.6.1.1 Integral draft diverter.

For units employing an integral draft diverter, install nine thermocouples, wired in parallel, in a horizontal plane in the five-foot test stack located one foot from the test stack inlet. Equalize the length of all thermocouple leads before paralleling. Locate one thermocouple in the center of the stack. Locate eight thermocouples along imaginary lines intersecting at right angles in this horizontal plane at points one third and two thirds of the distance between the center of the stack and the stack wall.

For units with a stack diameter 2 inches or less, five thermocouples may be installed instead of nine. Locate one thermocouple in the center of the stack. Locate four thermocouples along imaginary lines intersecting at right angles in this horizontal plane at points halfway between the center of the stack and the stack wall.
