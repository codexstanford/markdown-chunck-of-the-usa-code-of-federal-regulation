###### Step 7:

If testing a multi-mount ceiling fan, repeat steps 1 through 6 with the ceiling fan in the ceiling fan configuration (associated with either hugger or standard ceiling fans) not already tested.

If a multi-head ceiling fan includes more than one category of ceiling fan head, then test at least one of each unique category. A fan head with different construction that could affect air movement or power consumption, such as housing, blade pitch, or motor, would constitute a different category of fan head.
