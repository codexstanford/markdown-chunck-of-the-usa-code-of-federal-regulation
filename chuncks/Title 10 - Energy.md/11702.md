###### ยง 431.462 Definitions.

The following definitions are applicable to this subpart, including appendices A and B. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of the definitions adopted in this section takes precedence over any descriptions or definitions found in the 2014 version of ANSI/HI Standard 1.1-1.2, "Rotodynamic (Centrifugal) Pumps For Nomenclature And Definitions" (ANSI/HI 1.1-1.2-2014; incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463), or the 2014 version of ANSI/HI Standard 2.1-2.2, "Rotodynamic (Vertical) Pumps For Nomenclature And Definitions" (ANSI/HI 2.1-2.2-2014; incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463). In cases where definitions reference design intent, DOE will consider marketing materials, labels and certifications, and equipment design to determine design intent.
