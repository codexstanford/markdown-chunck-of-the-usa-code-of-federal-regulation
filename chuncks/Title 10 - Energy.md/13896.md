###### ยง 603.205 Nature of the project.

Judgments relating to the nature of the project include:

(a) The principal purpose of the project is to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation of RD&D (i.e., assistance), rather than acquiring goods or services for the benefit of the Government (i.e., acquisition);

(b) To the maximum extent practicable, the TIA does not support RD&D that duplicates other RD&D being conducted under existing programs carried out by the DOE; and

(c) The use of a standard contract, grant or cooperative agreement for the project is not feasible or appropriate (see questions in ยง 603.225).
