(2) Capital investment yearly cash outlays (I) must include all items that are capital investments for Federal income tax purposes. All purchased equipment that has a useful life greater than one year, capitalized engineering costs, land, construction, environmental offsets, fuel inventory, transmission facilities, piping, etc., that are necessary for the operation of the unit must be included. However, an item must only be included if a cash outlay is required after the decision has been made to build the unit; sunk costs must not be included (if the firm owns the land, its purchase price may not be included).

(3)(i) The annual cash outlays for operations and maintenance expense (OM) and fuel expense (FL) for a powerplant may be computed by one of the following three methods; however, the one chosen must be consistently applied throughout the analysis.

(A) Assume the energy produced by the powerplant equals seventy (70) percent of design capacity times 8760 hours for each year during the life of the powerplant, and compute cash outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel expenses for the powerplant.
