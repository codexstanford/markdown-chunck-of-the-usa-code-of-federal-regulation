####### Guideline for Time Constant.

3.4.2

(a) The following guideline is suggested for the tester as a means to facilitate the measurement of resistance in accordance with the accuracy requirements of section 2.3:

(b) The accurate reading of resistance Rmay be facilitated by shortening the time constant. This is done by introducing a resistor Rin series with the winding under test in both the bridge and voltmeter-ammeter circuits as shown in Figures 3.1 to 3.3. The relationship for the time constant is:

(c) Because Ris in the denominator of the expression for the time constant, increasing the resistance Rwill decrease the time constant. If the time constant in a given test circuit is too long for the resistance readings to be stable, then a higher resistance can be substituted for the existing R, and successive replacements can be made until adequate stability is reached.
