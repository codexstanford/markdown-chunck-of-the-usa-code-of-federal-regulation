####### i.e.,

Case 1. For outdoor bin temperatures where T(T) is equal to or greater than T(the maximum supply temperature determined according to section 3.1.10 of this appendix), determine Q(T) and E(T) as specified in section 4.2.1 of this appendix (Q(T) = Q(T) and E(T) = E(T)).

Calculate the space heating capacity and electrical power of the heat pump without the heat comfort controller being active as specified in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (Equations 4.2.2-1 and 4.2.2-2) for each outdoor bin temperature, T, that is listed in Table 20. Denote these capacities and electrical powers by using the subscript "hp" instead of "h." Calculate the mass flow rate (expressed in pounds-mass of dry air per hour) and the specific heat of the indoor air (expressed in Btu/lbm&#xB7; &#xB0;F) from the results of the H1test using:

Evaluate e(T)/N, RH(T)/N, X(T), PLF, and Î´(T) as specified in section 4.2.1 of this appendix with the exception of replacing references to the H1C test and section 3.6.1 of this appendix with the H1Ctest and section 3.6.2 of this appendix. For each bin calculation, use the space heating capacity and electrical power from Case 1 or Case 2, whichever applies.
