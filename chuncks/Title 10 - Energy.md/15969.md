### PART 905 - ENERGY PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
#### Subpart B - Integrated Resource Planning
##### ยง 905.20 When are customers in noncompliance with the regulations in this subpart, and how does Western ensure compliance?
###### Penalty options.

(d)(1) Beginning with the first full billing period following the notice specified in paragraph (c) of this section, Western will impose a surcharge of 10 percent of the monthly power charges until the deficiency specified in the notice is cured, or until 12 months pass. However, Western will not immediately impose a penalty if the customer or its MBA or IRP cooperative requests reconsideration by filing a written appeal under ยง 905.21.

(2) The surcharge increases to 20 percent for the second 12 months and to 30 percent per year thereafter until the deficiency is cured.

(3) After the first 12 months of the surcharge and instead of imposing any further surcharge, Western may impose a penalty that would reduce the resource delivered under a customer's long-term firm power contract(s) by 10 percent. Western may impose this resource reduction either:

(i) When it appears to be more effective to ensure customer compliance, or

(ii) When such reduction may be more cost-effective for Western.

(4) The penalty provisions in existing contracts will continue to be in effect and administered and enforced according to applicable contract provisions.
