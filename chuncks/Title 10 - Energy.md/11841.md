E.3.5 Determine the true power factor at each applicable load point specified in Table 1 of this appendix for each DPPP variety and speed configuration as a ratio of driver power input to the motor (or controls, if present) (), in watts, divided by the product of the voltage in volts and the current in amps at each load point, as shown in the following equation:

E.4 Determination of Maximum Head. Determine the maximum head for self-priming pool filter pumps, non-self-priming pool filter pumps, and waterfall pumps by measuring the head at maximum speed and the minimum flow rate at which the pump is designed to operate continuously or safely, where the minimum flow rate is assumed to be zero unless stated otherwise in the manufacturer literature.

F.1 Test Method. Determine the vertical lift and true priming time of non-self-priming pool filter pumps and self-priming pool filter pumps that are not already certified as self-priming under NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463) by testing such pumps pursuant to section C.3 of appendix C of NSF/ANSI 50-2015, except for the modifications and exceptions listed in the following sections F.1.1 through F.1.5 of this appendix:

F.1.1 Where section C.3.2, "Apparatus," and section C.3.4, "Self-priming capability test method," of NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463) state that the "suction line must be essentially as shown in annex C, figure C.1;" the phrase "essentially as shown in Annex C, figure C.1" means:

(1) The centerline of the pump impeller shaft is situated a vertical distance equivalent to the specified vertical lift (VL), calculated in accordance with section F.1.1.1. of this appendix, above the water level of a water tank of sufficient volume as to maintain a constant water surface level for the duration of the test;
