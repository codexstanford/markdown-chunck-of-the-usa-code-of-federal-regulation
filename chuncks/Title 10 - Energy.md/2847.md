###### Definitions.,construction

(a)As used in this section,means the activities in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and does not mean the activities in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(1) Activities constituting construction are the driving of piles, subsurface preparation, placement of backfill, concrete, or permanent retaining walls within an excavation, installation of foundations, or in-place assembly, erection, fabrication, or testing, which are for:

(i) Safety-related structures, systems, or components (SSCs) of a facility, as defined in 10 CFR 50.2;

(ii) SSCs relied upon to mitigate accidents or transients or used in plant emergency operating procedures;

(iii) SSCs whose failure could prevent safety-related SSCs from fulfilling their safety-related function;

(iv) SSCs whose failure could cause a reactor scram or actuation of a safety-related system;

(v) SSCs necessary to comply with 10 CFR part 73;

(vi) SSCs necessary to comply with 10 CFR 50.48 and criterion 3 of 10 CFR part 50, appendix A; and

(vii) Onsite emergency facilities, that is, technical support and operations support centers, necessary to comply with 10 CFR 50.47 and 10 CFR part 50, appendix E.

(x) With respect to production or utilization facilities, other than testing facilities and nuclear power plants, required to be licensed under Section 104.a or Section 104.c of the Act, the erection of buildings which will be used for activities other than operation of a facility and which may also be used to house a facility (e.g., the construction of a college laboratory building with space for installation of a training reactor).
