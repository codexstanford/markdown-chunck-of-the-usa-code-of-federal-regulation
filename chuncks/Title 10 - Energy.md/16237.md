###### Potentially adverse conditions.

(c)(1) Ground-water conditions in the host rock that could affect the solubility or the chemical reactivity of the engineered-barrier system to the extent that the expected repository performance could be compromised.

(2) Geochemical processes or conditions that could reduce the sorption of radionuclides or degrade the rock strength.

(3) Pre-waste-emplacement ground-water conditions in the host rock that are chemically oxidizing.
