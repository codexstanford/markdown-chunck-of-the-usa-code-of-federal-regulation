3.5.2.Before starting the steady-state verification prior to the standby loss test energize the primary control such that it is always calling for heating and the heating element is operating at the rated input. Maintain the supply water temperature as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (70 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F). Set the control so that the outlet water temperature (T) is 140 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F. If the water heater includes a built-in safety mechanism that prevents it from achieving a heat exchanger outlet water temperature of 140 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F, adjust the control to its maximum setting.

3.6.1. For each connection leaving the water heater that is required for the unit to achieve the rated input, the outlet water temperature must not differ from that of any other outlet water connection by more than 2 &#xB0;F during the steady-state verification period prior to the standby loss test.

3.6.2. Determine the outlet water temperature representative for the entire unit at every required measurement interval by calculating the average of the outlet water temperatures measured at each connection leaving the water heater jacket or enclosure that is used during testing. Use the outlet water temperature representative for the entire unit in all calculations for the standby loss test.
