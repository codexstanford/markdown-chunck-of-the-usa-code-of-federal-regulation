##### ยง 905.15 What are the requirements for the small customer plan alternative?
###### Maintaining small customer status.

(d)(1) Every year on the anniversary of Western's approval of the plan, small customers must submit a letter to Western verifying that either their annual energy sales and usage is 25 GWh or less averaged over the previous 5 years, or they continue to be end-use customers. The letter must also identify their achievements against targeted action plans, as well as the revised summary of actions if the previous summary of actions has expired.

(2) Western will use the letter for overall program evaluation and comparison with the customer's plan, and for verification of continued small customer status. Customers may submit annual update letters outside of the anniversary date if previously agreed to by Western so long as the letter contains all required data for the previous full year.
