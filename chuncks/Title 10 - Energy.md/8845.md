####### e.g.,

(a) To facilitate the activation of other modes (including activation or deactivation of active mode) by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer. A timer is a continuous clock function (which may or may not be associated with a display) that provides regular scheduled tasks (switching) and that operates on a continuous basis.

(b) Continuous functions, including information or status displays (including clocks) or sensor-based functions.

2.20 "Theoretical comparable single-speed room air conditioner" means a theoretical single-speed room air conditioner with the same cooling capacity and electrical power input as the variable-speed room air conditioner under test, with no cycling losses considered, at test condition 1 in Table 1 of this appendix.

2.21 "Variable-speed compressor" means a compressor that can vary its rotational speed in non-discrete stages or discrete steps from low to full.

2.22 "Variable-speed room air conditioner" means a type of room air conditioner that can automatically adjust compressor speed based on detected conditions.
