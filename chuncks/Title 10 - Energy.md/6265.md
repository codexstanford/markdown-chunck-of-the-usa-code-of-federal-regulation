###### Classification.

(a)Classified information generated or possessed by a licensee, certificate holder, or other person must be appropriately marked. Classified material which is not conducive to markings (e.g., equipment) may be exempt from this requirement. These exemptions are subject to the approval of the CSA on a case-by-case basis. If a person or facility generates or possesses information that is believed to be classified based on guidance provided by the NRC or by derivation from classified documents, but which no authorized classifier has determined to be classified, the information must be protected and marked with the appropriate classification markings pending review and signature of an NRC authorized classifier. This information shall be protected as classified information pending final determination.
