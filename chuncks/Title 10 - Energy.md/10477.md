###### Measurement of jacket surface temperature.

7.6Divide the jacket of the boiler into 6-inch squares when practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4 inch by 9 inch or 3 inch by 12 inch sections, and determine the surface temperature at the center of each square or section with a surface thermocouple. Record the surface temperature of the 36-square-inch areas in groups where the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch areas is less than 10 &#xB0;F for temperature up to 100 &#xB0;F above room temperature, and less than 20 &#xB0;F for temperatures more than 100 &#xB0;F above room temperature.
