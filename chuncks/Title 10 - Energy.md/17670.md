(4)Hearing loss without aids not to exceed 30 db average at 500, 1000, 2000 Hz, with no loss greater than 40 db at any of these frequencies and the ability to localize sounds with a difference of not more than 15 db average loss between the two ears. Hearing loss beyond indicated level would interfere with ability to function and respond to commands in emergency situations. Use of a hearing aid is allowed for one ear only with the remaining ear qualifying for no more than an average of 30 db loss at frequencies of 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz. If a hearing aid is necessary, suitable testing procedures must be used to assure auditory acuity equivalent to the above requirement for the difference between two ears.
