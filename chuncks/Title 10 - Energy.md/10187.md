###### Instrumentation placement.

3.1.1.3Place the aspirating psychrometer or relative humidity and dry-bulb temperature sensors perpendicular to, and 1 ft. in front of, the center of the process air intake grille. When using an aspirating psychrometer, for dehumidifiers with multiple process air intake grilles, place a separate sampling tree perpendicular to, and 1 ft. in front of, the center of each process air intake grille, with the samples combined and connected to a single psychrometer using a minimal length of insulated ducting. The psychrometer shall be used to monitor inlet conditions of one test unit only. When using relative humidity and dry-bulb temperature sensors, for dehumidifiers with multiple process air intake grilles, place a relative humidity sensor and dry-bulb temperature sensor perpendicular to, and 1 ft. in front of, the center of each process air intake grille.
