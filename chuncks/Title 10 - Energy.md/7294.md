##### ยง 300.8 Calculating emission reductions.
###### Changes in avoided emissions (for actions within entity boundaries).

(4)An entity may use changes in avoided emissions to determine its emission reductions. Avoided emissions eligible to be included in the calculation of net emission reductions that qualify for registration include those associated with the sale of electricity, steam, hot water or chilled water generated from non-emitting or low-emitting sources as a basis for determining net emission reductions as long as:

(i) The measurement and calculation methods used comply with the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see ยง 300.13);

(ii) The entity certifies that any increased sales were not attributable to the acquisition of a generating facility that had been previously operated, unless the entity's base period includes generation values from the acquired facility's operation prior to its acquisition; and

(iii) Generators of distributed energy that have net emissions in their base period and intend to report reductions resulting from changes in eligible avoided emissions, use a method specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see ยง 300.13) that integrates the calculation of reductions resulting from both changes in emissions intensity and changes in avoided emissions.
