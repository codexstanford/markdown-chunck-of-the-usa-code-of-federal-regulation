#### Subpart D - Classifying and Declassifying Matter Containing RD, FRD, or TFNI
##### ยง 1045.120 What training is required for persons who have access to or who derivatively classify matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI?
###### e.g.,

(7) How to submit a challenge if they believe RD, FRD, or TFNI information (a guide topic) or matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI is not properly classified; and

(8) Access requirements for matter marked as containing RD or FRD.

(b) Each person with access to RD and FRD must also receive periodic refresher briefings covering these same topics.

(c) In addition to the training in paragraph (a) of this section, prior to derivatively classifying matter containing RD, or FRD and every 2 years thereafter, each RD Derivative Classifier must also receive training that explains:

(1) The use of classification guides, classification bulletins, and portion-marked source documents to classify matter containing RD and FRD;

(2) What to do if applicable classification guidance is not available;

(3) Limitations on an RD Derivative Classifier's authority to remove RD or FRD portions from matter; and

(4) Marking requirements for matter containing RD and FRD.

(d) Prior to having access to TFNI, and periodically thereafter, each person must receive the following training (which may be combined with the training required for access to RD or FRD):

(1) What information is potentially TFNI;

(2) Only a person with appropriate training may determine if matter contains TFNI;

(3) Marking requirements for matter containing TFNI;

(4) Matter containing TFNI is not automatically declassified and only DOE authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing TFNI; and
