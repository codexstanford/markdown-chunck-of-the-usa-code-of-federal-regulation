####### Verification of refrigeration system net capacity.

(2)The net capacity of the refrigeration system basic model will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix C for each unit tested. The results of the measurement(s) will be averaged and compared to the value of net capacity certified by the manufacturer. The certified net capacity will be considered valid only if the average measured net capacity is within plus or minus five percent of the certified net capacity.

(i) If the certified net capacity is found to be valid, the certified net capacity will be used as the basis for calculating the AWEF of the basic model.

(ii) If the certified net capacity is found to be invalid, the average measured net capacity will serve as the basis for calculating the annual energy consumption for the basic model.
