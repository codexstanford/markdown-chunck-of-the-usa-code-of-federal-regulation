(a) Neither a permit issued by the ERA pursuant to Executive Order 10485, as amended, nor the facility shall be transferable or assignable. Provided written notice is given to the ERA within 30 days, the authorization may continue in effect temporarily in the event of the involuntary transfer of the facility by operation of law (including transfers to receivers, trustees, or purchases under foreclosure or judicial sale). This continuance is contingent on the filing of an application for a new permit and may be effective until a decision is made thereon.
