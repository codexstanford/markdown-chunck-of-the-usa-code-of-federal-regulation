####### Criteria for exemption from preemption.

(a)Upon petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard, water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals), or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy conservation standard or water conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary shall prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he determines that the State has established by a preponderance of evidence that such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy interests or water interests. For the purposes of this section, the term "unusual and compelling State or local energy interests or water interests" means interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude than those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, or water plan and forecast the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings or water savings resulting from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy savings or water savings or production, including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on a national basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors including: the extent to which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered product in the State; the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered product type (or class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction in the current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within the U.S., or in the current or projected sales volume of the covered product type (or class) in the State and the U.S.; and the extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State appliance efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that such a rule will result in the unavailability in the State of any covered product (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).
