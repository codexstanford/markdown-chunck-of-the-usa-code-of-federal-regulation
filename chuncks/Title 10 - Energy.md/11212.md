means a group of models of distribution transformers manufactured by a single manufacturer, that have the same insulation type (liquid-immersed or dry-type), have the same number of phases (single or three), have the same standard kVA rating, and do not have any differentiating electrical, physical or functional features that affect energy consumption. Differences in voltage and differences in basic impulse insulation level (BIL) rating are examples of differentiating electrical features that affect energy consumption.
