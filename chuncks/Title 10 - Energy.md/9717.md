(A) 1.00 at high speed; and

(B) 1.31 at 40 percent speed or the nearest speed that is not less than 40 percent speed.

(iii) The provisions in this appendix apply to ceiling fans except:

(A) Ceiling fans where the plane of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades is not less than or equal to 45 degrees from horizontal, or cannot be adjusted based on the manufacturer's specifications to be less than or equal to 45 degrees from horizontal;
