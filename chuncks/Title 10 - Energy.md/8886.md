####### Natural gas supply.

1.4.2For an unvented gas heater utilizing natural gas, maintain the gas supply to the heater with a normal inlet test pressure immediately ahead of all controls at 7 to 10 inches of water column. The regulator outlet pressure at normal supply test pressure shall be approximately that recommended by the manufacturer. The natural gas supplied should have a higher heating value within +/-5 percent of 1,025 Btu's per standard cubic foot. Determine the higher heating value, in Btu's per standard cubic foot, for the natural gas to be used in the test, with an error no greater than one percent. Alternatively, the test can be conducted using "bottled" natural gas of a higher heating value within +/-5 percent of 1,025 Btu's per standard cubic foot as long as the actual higher heating value of the bottled natural gas has been determined with an error no greater than one percent as certified by the supplier.
