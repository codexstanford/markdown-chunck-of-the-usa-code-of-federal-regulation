###### Recordkeeping.

(d)Entities intending to register reductions must maintain adequate supporting records of base period data for the duration of their participation in the 1605(b) program. Supporting records for all reporting year data must be maintained for at least three years subsequent to the relevant reporting year to enable verification of all information reported. The records should document the basis for the entity's report to EIA, including:

(1) The content of entity statements, including the identification of the specific facilities, buildings, land holding and other operations or emission sources covered by the entity's reports and the legal, equity, operational and other bases for their inclusion;

(2) Information on the identification and assessment of changes in entity boundaries, processes or products that might have to be reported to EIA;

(3) Any agreements or relevant communications with other entities or third parties regarding the reporting of emissions or emission reductions associated with sources the ownership or operational control of which is shared;

(4) Information on the methods used to measure or estimate emissions, and the data collection and management systems used to gather and prepare this data for inclusion in reports;

(5) Information on the methods used to calculate emission reductions, including the basis for:

(i) The selection of the specific output measures used, and the data collection and management systems used to gather and prepare output data for use in the calculation of emission reductions;

(ii) The selection and modification of all base years, base periods and baselines used in the calculation of emission reductions;

(iii) Any baseline adjustments made to reflect acquisitions, divestitures or other changes;

(iv) Any models or other estimation methods used; and

(v) Any internal or independent verification procedures undertaken.
