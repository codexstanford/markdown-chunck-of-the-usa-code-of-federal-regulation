### PART 1004 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA)
#### ยง 1004.9 Fees for providing records.
##### Charges for unsuccessful search.

(6)DOE may assess charges for time spent searching even if the search fails to identify responsive records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If DOE estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice will offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel in order to reformulate the request to reduce the cost of the request.
