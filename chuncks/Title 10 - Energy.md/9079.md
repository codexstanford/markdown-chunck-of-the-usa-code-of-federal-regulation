###### Appendix I1 to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Conventional Cooking Products
####### Conventional gas cooking tops with a non-adjustable internal pressure regulator or without an internal pressure regulator.

3.1.3.2If the measured heat input rate of the burner under test is not within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer, remove the product's internal pressure regulator, or block it in the open position, and initially maintain the gas pressure ahead of all controls of the unit under test approximately equal to the manufacturer's recommended manifold pressure. Adjust the gas supply pressure such that the heat input rate of the burner under test is within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer. Adjust the burner with sufficient air flow to prevent a yellow flame or a flame with yellow tips. Complete section 3.1.4 of this appendix while maintaining the same gas pressure regulator adjustment.
