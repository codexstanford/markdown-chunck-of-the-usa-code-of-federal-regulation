####### [object Object]

Evaluate the quantities Q(47) and(47) according to section 3.7 of this appendix.

Otherwise (if no high temperature test is conducted using the same speed (RPM or power input frequency) as the H3test), calculate the 47 &#xB0;F capacity and power input values used for calculation of HSPF2 as follows:

c. If the H2test is not done, use the following equations to approximate the capacity and electrical power at the H2test conditions:
