a. Calculate the space cooling capacity,(), and electrical power consumption,(), of the test unit when operating at the cooling minimum air volume rate and outdoor temperature Tusing the equations given in section 4.1.2.1 of this appendix. Calculate the space cooling capacity,(), and electrical power consumption,(), of the test unit when operating at the cooling full-load air volume rate and outdoor temperature Tusing the equations given in section 4.1.2.1 of this appendix. In evaluating the section 4.1.2.1 equations, determine the quantities(82) and(82) from the B1 test,(95) and(95) from the Al test,(82) and(82) from the B2 test, and(95) and(95) from the Atest. Evaluate all eight quantities as specified in section 3.3. Refer to section 3.2.2.1 and Table 6 for additional information on the four referenced laboratory tests.

b. Determine the cooling mode cyclic degradation coefficient, C, as per sections 3.2.2.1 and 3.5 to 3.5.3 of this appendix. Assign this same value to C(K=2).
