####### Purpose.

(a)The purpose of this subpart is to provide guidelines for use by Federal agencies in their development of overall 10-year energy management plans to establish energy conservation goals, to reduce the rate of energy consumption, to promote the efficient use of energy, to promote switching for petroleum-based fuels and natural gas to coal and other energy sources, to provide a methodology for reporting their progress in meeting the goals of those plans, and to promote emergency energy conservation planning to assuage the impact of a sudden disruption in the supply of oil-based fuels, natural gas or electricity. The plan is intended to provide the cornerstone for a program to conserve energy in the general operations of an agency.
