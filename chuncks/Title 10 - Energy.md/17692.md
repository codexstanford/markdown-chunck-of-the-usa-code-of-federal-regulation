###### Return to work after medical removal.

(4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the SPO's employer must not return an SPO, who has been granted medical removal protection under this section, to the SPO's former job status.

(ii) If, in the PPMD's opinion, continued participation in PF duties will not pose an increased risk to the SPO's health and well-being or an increased risk (beyond those normally associated with SPO duties) of the SPO being a direct threat to self or others, the PPMD must fully discuss these matters with the SPO and then, in a written determination, may authorize the SPO's employer to return the SPO to former job status. Within one year from the PPMD's original decision to remove the individual from SPO status and subject to the SPO's ability to meet all other position related requirements (e.g., weapons qualifications, physical readiness standard, human reliability program, and refresher training), the employer must return the SPO to duty status given PPMD authorization to return to work. For durations beyond one year from the original decision given PPMD authorization to return to work, return to SPO status will be at the employer's discretion.
