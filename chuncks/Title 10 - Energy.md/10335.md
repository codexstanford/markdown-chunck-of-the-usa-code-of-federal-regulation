###### Nameplate output power

means the power output of the power supply as specified on the manufacturer's label on the power supply housing or, if absent from the housing, as specified in documentation provided by the manufacturer. For an adaptive external power supply with USB-PD ports, in place of the nameplate output power at the lowest voltage, use an output power calculated as the product of its lowest nameplate output voltage and 2 amps for each USB-PD port and as specified on the manufacturer's label or documentation at the highest voltage. This definition only applies to DOE testing and certification requirements and is unrelated to the physical nameplate label or documentation of an EPS.
