##### Appendix Y to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Battery Chargers
###### i.e.,

For any amended standards for battery chargers published after September 8, 2022, manufacturers must use the results of testing under appendix Y1 to determine compliance. Representations related to energy consumption must be made in accordance with the appropriate appendix that applies (appendix Y or appendix Y1) when determining compliance with the relevant standard. Manufacturers may also use appendix Y1 to certify compliance with amended standards, published after September 8, 2022, prior to the applicable compliance date for those standards.

This appendix provides the test requirements used to measure the energy consumption of battery chargers operating at either DC or United States AC line voltage (115V at 60Hz). This appendix also provides the test requirements used to measure the energy efficiency of uninterruptible power supplies as defined in section 2 of this appendix that utilize the standardized National Electrical Manufacturer Association (NEMA) plug, 1-15P or 5-15P, as specified in ANSI/NEMA WD 6-2016 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3) and have an AC output. This appendix does not provide a method for testing back-up battery chargers.

The following definitions are for the purposes of explaining the terminology associated with the test method for measuring battery charger energy consumption.
