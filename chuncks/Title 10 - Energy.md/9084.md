####### Simmering test.

3.1.4.4The product temperature must meet the specifications in section 2.5 of this appendix at the start of each simmering test. For each cooking zone, conduct the test method specified in Section 7.5.2 of IEC 60350-2, using the potential simmering setting identified in section 3.1.4.3 of this appendix for the initial simmering setting used in Section 7.5.2.2 of IEC 60350-2.

For conventional cooking tops with rotating knobs for selecting the power setting, the selection knob shall be turned in the direction from higher power to lower power to select the potential simmering setting for the test, to avoid hysteresis. If the appropriate setting is passed, the test is considered invalid and must be repeated after allowing the product to return to ambient conditions.
