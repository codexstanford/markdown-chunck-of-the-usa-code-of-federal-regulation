###### Substantial physical modification.

(d)In the case of electing and certifying powerplants, OFP will make its determination on whether a physical modification to a unit is "substantial" on a case-by-case basis. In the case of certifying powerplants, OFP will consider the factors set forth below for the purpose of concurrence in the certification. OFP will consider physical modifications made to the unit as "substantial" where warranted by the magnitude and complexity of the engineering task or where the modification would impact severely upon operations at the site.OFP will not, however, assess physical modification on the basis of cost.
