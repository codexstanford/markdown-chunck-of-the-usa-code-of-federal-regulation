2.4.3.1. The inverter shall be set up according to the manufacturer's instructional and operational manual included with the product. Manufacturers shall also record switching frequency in Hz, max frequency in Hz, Max output voltage in V, motor control method (V/f ratio, sensor less vector, etc.), load profile setting (constant torque, variable torque, etc.), and saving energy mode (if used). Deviation from the resulting settings, such as switching frequency or load torque curves for the purpose of optimizing test results shall not be permitted.

Prior to testing according to section 2 of this appendix, each basic model of the electric motor categories listed below must be set up in accordance with the instructions of this section to ensure consistent test results. These steps are designed to enable a motor to be attached to a dynamometer and run continuously for testing purposes. For the purposes of this appendix, a "standard bearing" is a 600- or 6000-series, either open or grease-lubricated double-shielded, single-row, deep groove, radial ball bearing.
