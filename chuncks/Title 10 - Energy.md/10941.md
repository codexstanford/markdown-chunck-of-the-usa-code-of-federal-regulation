###### Appendix F to Subpart F of Part 431 - Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Consumption of Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Small Commercial Package Air Conditioning and Heating Equipment With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h and Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Variable Refrigerant Flow Multi-Split Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h
####### Refrigerant line length corrections for air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h.

5.For test setups where it is physically impossible for the laboratory to use the required line length listed in Table 3 of ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010, then the actual refrigerant line length used by the laboratory may exceed the required length and the following cooling capacity correction factors are applied:
