###### Air Velocity and Power Consumption Testing Procedure:

3.3.2.

Measure the air velocity (FPM) and power consumption (W) for HSSD ceiling fans until stable measurements are achieved, measuring at high speed only. Measure the air velocity and power consumption for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD fan until stable measurements are achieved, measuring first at low speed and then at high speed. To determine low speed, start measurements at the lowest available speed and move to the next highest speed until the low speed definition in section 1.13 of this appendix is met. Air velocity and power consumption measurements are considered stable for high speed if:

(1) The average air velocity for each sensor varies by less than 5 percent or 2 FPM, whichever is greater, compared to the average air velocity measured for that same sensor in a successive set of air velocity measurements, and

(2) Average power consumption varies by less than 1 percent in a successive set of power consumption measurements.

(a) Air velocity and power consumption measurements are considered stable for low speed if:

(1) The average air velocity for each sensor varies by less than 10 percent or 2 FPM, whichever is greater, compared to the average air velocity measured for that same sensor in a successive set of air velocity measurements, and

(2) Average power consumption varies by less than 1 percent in a successive set of power consumption measurements.
