##### Appendix II to Part 504 - Fuel Price Computation
###### Introduction.,Annual Energy Outlook

(a)This appendix provides the equations and parameters needed to specify the price of the delivered fuels to be used in the cost calculations associated with parts 503 and 504 of these regulations. The delivered price of the fuel to be used to calculate delivered fuel expenses must reflect (1) the price of each fuel at the time of the petition, and (2) the effects of future real price increases for each fuel. The delivered price of an alternate fuel used to calculate delivered fuel expenses must reflect the petitioner's delivered price of the alternate fuel and the effects of real increases in the price of that alternate fuel. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below provide the procedure to: (1) Calculate fuel price and inflation indices; (2) account for projected real increases in fuel prices when planning to burn one or more than one fuel; and (3) account for projected real increases in the price of the alternate fuel. Table II-1 of this appendix (See paragraph (b)) contains example fuel price and inflation indices based on the latest data appearing in the Energy Information Administration's (EIA)(AEO).
