#### PART 500 - DEFINITIONS
##### ยง 500.2 General definitions.
###### Capability to use alternate fuel,

for the purposes of Title II prohibitions relating to construction of new powerplants, means the powerplant to be constructed:

(1) Has sufficient inherent design characteristics to permit the addition of equipment (including all necessary pollution devices) necessary to render such electric powerplant capable of using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source; and

(2) Is not physically, structurally, or technologically precluded from using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source.

Capability to use coal or another alternate fuel shall not be interpreted to require any such powerplant to be immediately able to use coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source on its initial day of operation. In addition, the owner or operator of a baseload powerplant need not have adequate on-site space for either a coal gasifier or any facilities for handling coal or related fuels.
