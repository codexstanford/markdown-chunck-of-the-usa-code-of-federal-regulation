3.7.1With all electrical auxiliaries of the vented heater not activated, measure the standby power (P) in accordance with the procedures in IEC 62301 (Second Edition) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3), except that section 2.9,and the voltage provision of section 2.3.5,of this appendix shall apply in lieu of the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) corresponding sections 4.2,and 4.3,Clarifying further, the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) sections 4.4,and section 5,shall apply in lieu of section 2.8,of this appendix. Measure the wattage so that all possible standby mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the standby mode wattage of a single auxiliary. The recorded standby power (P) shall be rounded to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10W, at least three significant figures shall be reported.
