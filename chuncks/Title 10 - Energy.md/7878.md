() For other than non-space-constrained single-split-system air conditioners and heat pumps, the manufacturer must test each basic model as required under ยง 429.16(b)(2).

(B) Using the AEDM, calculate the energy use or efficiency for each of the tested individual models/combinations within each basic model. Compare the represented value based on testing and the AEDM energy use or efficiency output according to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the AEDM and that their representations are appropriate and the models being distributed in commerce meet the applicable standards, regardless of the amount of testing required in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
