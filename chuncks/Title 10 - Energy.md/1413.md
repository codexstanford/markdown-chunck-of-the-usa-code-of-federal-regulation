###### Intake by inhalation.

(b)If the only intake of radionuclides is by inhalation, the total effective dose equivalent limit is not exceeded if the sum of the deep-dose equivalent divided by the total effective dose equivalent limit, and one of the following, does not exceed unity:

(1) The sum of the fractions of the inhalation ALI for each radionuclide, or

(2) The total number of derived air concentration-hours (DAC-hours) for all radionuclides divided by 2,000, or

(3) The sum of the calculated committed effective dose equivalents to all significantly irradiatedorgans or tissues (T) calculated from bioassay data using appropriate biological models and expressed as a fraction of the annual limit.
