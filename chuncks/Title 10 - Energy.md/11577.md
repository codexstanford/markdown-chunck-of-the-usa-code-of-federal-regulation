###### Appendix A to Subpart T of Part 431 - Uniform Test Method for Certain Air Compressors

A.1. For the purposes of measuring air compressor performance, the equipment necessary to measure volume flow rate, inlet and discharge pressure, temperature, condensate, and packaged compressor power input must comply with the equipment and accuracy requirements specified in ISO 1217:2009(E) sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 5.9, and Annex C, sections C.2.3 and C.2.4 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.343).

A.2. Electrical measurement equipment must be capable of measuring true root mean square (RMS) current, true RMS voltage, and real power up to the 40th harmonic of fundamental supply source frequency.

A.3. Any instruments used to measure a particular parameter specified in paragraph (A.1.) must have a combined accuracy of +/-2.0 percent of the measured value at the fundamental supply source frequency, where combined accuracy is the square root of the sum of the squares of individual instrument accuracies.

A.4. Any instruments used to directly measure the density of air must have an accuracy of +/-1.0 percent of the measured value.
