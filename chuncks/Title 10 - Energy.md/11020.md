####### 5.,Steady-State Conditions.

1.The following conditions must be met at consecutive readings taken at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, for which measurements are taken at 10-minute intervals) to verify the water heater has achieved steady-state operation during the steady-state verification period and thermal efficiency test.

5.1.1. The water flow rate must be maintained within +/- 0.25 gallons per minute (gpm) of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period;

5.1.2. Outlet water temperature must be maintained at 70 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F above supply water temperature;

5.1.3. Fuel input rate must be maintained within +/- 2 percent of the rated input certified by the manufacturer;

5.1.4. The supply water temperature must be maintained within +/- 0.50 &#xB0;F of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period; and

5.1.5. The rise between the supply and outlet water temperatures must be maintained within +/- 0.50 &#xB0;F of its initial value taken at the start of the steady-state verification period for units with rated input less than 500,000 Btu/h, and maintained within +/- 1.00 &#xB0;F of its initial value for units with rated input greater than or equal to 500,000 Btu/h.
