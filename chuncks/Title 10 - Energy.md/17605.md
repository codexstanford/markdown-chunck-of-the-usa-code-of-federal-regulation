###### Job analysis (JA)

is a systematic method used to obtain a detailed listing of the tasks of a specific job. JAs must be derived from criteria determined and published by the DOE National Training Center or identified and documented through a site-specific Mission Essential Task List (METL)-based process based on a set of Departmental Nuclear Security Enterprise-wide standards. A METL-based process that identifies and formally documents duties, tasks, and sub-tasks to be trained is commensurate with the process to develop JAs.
