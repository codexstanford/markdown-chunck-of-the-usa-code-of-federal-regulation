####### Test load preparation.

2.7.2Dampen the load by agitating it in water whose temperature is 60 &#xB0;F +/-5 &#xB0;F and consists of 0 to 17 parts per million hardness for approximately 2 minutes to saturate the fabric. Then, extract water from the wet test load by spinning the load until the moisture content of the load is between 52.5 and 57.5 percent of the bone-dry weight of the test load. Make a final mass adjustment, such that the moisture content is 57.5 percent +/-0.33 percent by adding water uniformly distributed among all of the test cloths in a very fine spray using a spray bottle.
