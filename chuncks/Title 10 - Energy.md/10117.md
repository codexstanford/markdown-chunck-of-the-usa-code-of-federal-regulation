##### Appendix W to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Compact Fluorescent Lamps

1. Scope:

1.1. Integrated compact fluorescent lamps.

1.1.1. This appendix specifies the test methods required to measure the initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, time to failure, power factor, correlated color temperature (CCT), color rendering index (CRI), and start time of an integrated compact fluorescent lamp.

1.1.2. This appendix describes how to conduct rapid cycle stress testing for integrated compact fluorescent lamps.

1.1.3. This appendix specifies test methods required to measure standby mode energy consumption applicable to integrated CFLs capable of operation in standby mode (as defined in ยง 430.2), such as those that can be controlled wirelessly.

1.2. Non-integrated compact fluorescent lamps.

1.2.1. This appendix specifies the test methods required to measure the initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, time to failure, CCT, and CRI for non-integrated compact fluorescent lamps.
