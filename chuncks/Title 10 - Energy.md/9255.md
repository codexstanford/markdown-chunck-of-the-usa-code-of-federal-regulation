###### Appendix J2 to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Automatic and Semi-automatic Clothes Washers
####### Clothes washers with automatic water fill control system and alternate manual water fill control system.

3.2.6.3If a clothes washer with an automatic water fill control system allows user selection of manual controls as an alternative, test both manual and automatic modes and, for each mode, calculate the energy consumption (HE, ME, and D) and water consumption (Q) values as set forth in section 4 of this appendix. Then, calculate the average of the two values (one from each mode, automatic and manual) for each variable (HE, ME, D, and Q) and use the average value for each variable in the final calculations in section 4 of this appendix.
