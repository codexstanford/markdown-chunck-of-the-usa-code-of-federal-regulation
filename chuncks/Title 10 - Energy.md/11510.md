(A) The metal halide lamp used for testing must meet the specifications of a reference lamp as defined by ANSI C82.9-2016 and the rated values of the corresponding lamp data sheet as specified in ANSI C78.43-2017 (both incorporated by reference;ยง 431.323) for single-ended lamps and ANSI C78.44-2016 (incorporated by reference;ยง 431.323) for double-ended lamps.

(B) Ballasts designated with ANSI codes corresponding to more than one lamp must be tested with the lamp having the highest nominal lamp wattage as specified in ANSI C78.43-2017 or ANSI C78.44-2016, as applicable.

(C) Ballasts designated with ANSI codes corresponding to both ceramic metal halide lamps (code beginning with "C") and quartz metal halide lamps (code beginning with "M") of the same nominal lamp wattage must be tested with the quartz metal halide lamp.
