Determine the average non-zero power of the non-operating central air conditioner or heat pump over a 5-minute interval and designate it as2, the heating season total off mode power. For units with crankcase heaters whose controls cycle or vary crankcase heater power over time, the test period shall consist of three complete crankcase heater cycles or 18 hours, whichever comes first.
