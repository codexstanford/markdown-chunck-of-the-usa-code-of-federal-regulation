(ii) Without a substantial dilution of shareholder equity;

(iii) Without an unreasonably adverse affect on the utility's credit rating; or

(iv) In the case of non-investor-owned public utilities, without jeopardizing the utility's ability to recover its capital investment, through tariffs, without unreasonably adverse economic effect on its service area (such as adverse impacts on local industry or undue hardship to ratepayers).

(3) No alternative power supply exists, as required under ยง 503.8 of these regulations;

(4) Use of mixtures is not feasible, as required under ยง 503.9 of these regulations; and

(5) Alternative sites are not available, as required under ยง 503.11 of these regulations.
