#### ยง 1003.16 Dismissal of petitions.
##### Dismissal with prejudice.

(a)The dismissal of a petition with prejudice by the OHA terminates the OHA's review of the petition and bars the petitioner from submitting any future petition concerning the same, or substantially the same, issues as those in the petition. The OHA may dismiss a petition with prejudice if:

(1) The OHA lacks jurisdiction to consider the petition;

(2) The petitioner has already received a Decision and Order from the Director in response to a previously filed petition that addresses the same issue;

(3) The petitioner provides a false statement under oath or files a false instrument with the OHA, as determined by the OHA;

(4) The petitioner refuses to comply with an order issued by the OHA;

(5) The petition is untimely;

(6) The issues raised in the petition are moot;

(7) The petitioner repeatedly fails to comply with procedural requirements; or,

(8) The same or a substantially similar petition was previously dismissed by the OHA without prejudice, and the same basis for dismissal without prejudice exists upon refiling by the same petitioner.
