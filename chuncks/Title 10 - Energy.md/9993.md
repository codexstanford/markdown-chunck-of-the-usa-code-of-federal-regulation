###### Standby mode.

4.2For all pool heaters, record the average electric power consumption during the standby mode test, Pin W, in accordance with section 5 of IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3). For fossil fuel-fired pool heaters, record the fossil fuel energy consumption during the standby test, Q, in Btu. (Milli-volt electrical consumption need not be considered in units so equipped.) Ambient temperature and voltage specifications in section 4.1 of this appendix shall apply to this standby mode testing. Round the recorded standby power (P) to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10 W, record at least three significant figures.
