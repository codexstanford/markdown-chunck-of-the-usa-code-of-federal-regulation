####### Order

means a written directive or verbal communication of a written directive, if promptly confirmed in writing, issued by the DOE or a State Office. It may be issued in response to an application, petition or request for DOE action or in response to an appeal from an order, or it may be a remedial order or other directive issued by the DOE or a State Office on its own initiative. A notice of probable violation is not an order. For purposes of this definition a "written directive" shall include telegrams, telecopies and similar transcriptions.
