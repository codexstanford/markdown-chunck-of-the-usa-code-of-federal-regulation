####### Commercial prerinse spray valve

means a handheld device that has a release-to-close valve and is suitable for removing food residue from food service items before cleaning them in commercial dishwashing or ware washing equipment. DOE may determine that a device is suitable for removing food residue from food service items before cleaning them in commercial dishwashing or ware washing equipment based on any or all of the following:

(1) Equipment design and representations (for example, whether equipment is represented as being capable of rinsing dishes as compared to equipment that is represented exclusively for washing walls and floors or animal washing);

(2) Channels of marketing and sales (for example, whether equipment is marketed or sold through outlets that market or sell to food service entities);

(3) Actual sales (including whether the end-users are restaurants or commercial or institutional kitchens, even if those sales are indirectly through an entity such as a distributor).
