###### Condensate collection.

3.1.2If means are provided on the dehumidifier for draining condensate away from the cabinet, collect the condensate in a substantially closed vessel to prevent re-evaporation, and place the collection vessel on the weight-measuring instrument. If no means for draining condensate away from the cabinet are provided, disable any automatic shutoff of dehumidification mode operation that is activated when the collection container is full, and collect any overflow in a pan. The pan must be covered as much as possible to prevent re-evaporation without impeding the collection of overflow water. Place both the dehumidifier and the overflow pan on the weight-measuring instrument for direct reading of the condensate weight during the test. Do not use any internal pump to drain the condensate unless such pump operation is provided for by default in dehumidification mode.
