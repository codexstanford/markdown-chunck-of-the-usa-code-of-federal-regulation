3.7.2If the unit is equipped with a seasonal off switch or there is an expected difference between off mode power and standby mode power, measure off mode power (P) in accordance with the standby power procedures in IEC 62301 (Second Edition) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3), except that section 2.9,and the voltage provision of section 2.3.5,of this appendix shall apply in lieu of the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) corresponding sections 4.2,and 4.3,Clarifying further, the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) sections 4.4,and section 5,shall apply in lieu of section 2.8,of this appendix. Measure the wattage so that all possible off mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the off mode wattage of a single auxiliary. If there is no expected difference in off mode power and standby mode power, let P= P, in which case no separate measurement of off mode power is necessary. The recorded off mode power (P) shall be rounded to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10W, at least three significant figures shall be reported.
