####### Pool heaters.

(p)(1) Determine the thermal efficiency (E) of a pool heater expressed as a percent (%) in accordance with section 5.1 of appendix P to this subpart.

(2) Determine the integrated thermal efficiency (TE) of a pool heater expressed as a percent (%) in accordance with section 5.4 of appendix P to this subpart.

(3) When estimating the annual operating cost of pool heaters, calculate the sum of:

(i) The product of the average annual fossil fuel energy consumption, in Btus per year, determined according to section 5.2 of appendix P to this subpart, and the representative average unit cost in dollars per Btu for natural gas or oil, as appropriate, as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act; plus

(ii) The product of the average annual electrical energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per year determined according to section 5.3 of appendix P to this subpart and converted to kilowatt-hours using a conversion factor of 3412 Btus = 1 kilowatt-hour, and the representative average unit cost in dollars per kilowatt-hours as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act. Round the resulting sum to the nearest dollar per year.
