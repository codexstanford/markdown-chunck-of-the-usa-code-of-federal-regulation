####### i.e.,

(B) The quotient of the mean of the standardized design heating requirement for the sample, in Btu's per hour, for the appropriate generalized climatic region of interest (corresponding to the regional heating load hours from "A") and determined for each unit in the sample in section 4.2 of appendix M to subpart B of part 430, divided by the represented value of HSPF, in Btu's per watt-hour, calculated for the appropriate generalized climatic region of interest and corresponding to the above-mentioned standardized design heating requirement, and determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii);

(C) The adjustment factor of 0.77; which serves to adjust the calculated design heating requirement and heating load hours to the actual load experienced by a heating system;

(D) A conversion factor of 0.001 kilowatts per watt; and

(E) The representative average unit cost of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act.

(ii) When using appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430, the product of:

(A) The estimated number of regional heating load hours per year determined from Table 21 in section 4.4 of appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430;

(B) The quotient of the represented value of cooling capacity (for air-source heat pumps that provide both cooling and heating) in Btu's per hour, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, or the represented value of heating capacity (for air-source heat pumps that provide only heating), as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(D) of this section, divided by the represented value of HSPF2, in Btu's per watt-hour, calculated for the appropriate generalized climatic region of interest, and determined in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section;

(C) The adjustment factor of 1.15 (for heat pumps that are not variable-speed) or 1.07 (for heat pumps that are variable-speed), which serves to adjust the calculated design heating requirement and heating load hours to the actual load experienced by a heating system;

(D) A conversion factor of 0.001 kilowatts per watt; and

(E) The representative average unit cost of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act.
