###### The Award Document
####### ยง 603.1005 General responsibilities.

The contracting officer is responsible for ensuring that the award document is complete and accurate. The document should:

(a) Address all issues;

(b) State requirements directly. It is not helpful to readers to incorporate statutes or rules by reference, without sufficient explanation of the requirements. The contracting officer generally should not incorporate clauses from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR parts 1-53) or Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR parts 901-970) because those provisions are designed for procurement contracts that are used to acquire goods and services, rather than for a TIA or other assistance instruments.

(c) Be written in clear and concise language, to minimize potential ambiguity.
