####### Certification reports.

(c)For commercial water heating equipment other than residential-duty commercial water heaters:

(1) The requirements of § 429.12 apply; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following public equipment-specific information:

(i) Commercial electric storage water heaters with storage capacity less than or equal to 140 gallons: The standby loss in percent per hour (%/h) and the measured storage volume in gallons (gal).

(ii) Commercial gas-fired and oil-fired storage water heaters with storage capacity less than or equal to 140 gallons: The thermal efficiency in percent (%), the standby loss in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), the rated storage volume in gallons (gal), and the rated input in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(iii) Commercial water heaters and hot water supply boilers with storage capacity greater than 140 gallons: The thermal efficiency in percent (%); whether the storage volume is greater than 140 gallons (Yes/No); whether the tank surface area is insulated with at least R-12.5 (Yes/No); whether a standing pilot light is used (Yes/No); for gas or oil-fired water heaters, whether the basic model has a fire damper or fan-assisted combustion (Yes/No); and, if applicable, pursuant to § 431.110 of this chapter, the standby loss in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); the measured storage volume in gallons (gal); and the rated input in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(iv) Commercial gas-fired and oil-fired instantaneous water heaters with storage capacity greater than or equal to 10 gallons and gas-fired and oil-fired hot water supply boilers with storage capacity greater than or equal to 10 gallons: The thermal efficiency in percent (%); the standby loss in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); the rated storage volume in gallons (gal); the rated input in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); whether the water heater includes a storage tank with a storage volume greater than or equal to 10 gallons (Yes/No). For equipment that does not meet the definition of storage-type instantaneous water heaters (as set forth in 10 CFR 431.102), in addition to the requirements discussed previously in this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the following must also be included in the certification report: whether the measured storage volume is determined using weight-based test in accordance with § 431.106 of this chapter or the calculation-based method in accordance with § 429.72; whether the water heater will initiate main burner operation based on a temperature-controlled call for heating that is internal to the water heater (Yes/No); whether the water heater is equipped with an integral pump purge functionality (Yes/No); if the water heater is equipped with integral pump purge, the default duration of the pump off delay (minutes).

(v) Commercial gas-fired and oil-fired instantaneous water heaters with storage capacity less than 10 gallons and gas-fired and oil-fired hot water supply boilers with storage capacity less than 10 gallons: The thermal efficiency in percent (%); the rated storage volume in gallons (gal), the rated input in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); and whether the measured storage volume is determined using weight-based test in accordance with § 431.106 of this chapter or the calculation-based method in accordance with § 429.72.
