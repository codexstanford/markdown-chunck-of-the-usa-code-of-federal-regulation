### PART 1045 - NUCLEAR CLASSIFICATION AND DECLASSIFICATION
#### Subpart C - Determining if Information is RD, FRD, or TFNI
##### ยง 1045.80 What are the classification and declassification presumptions?

(a) The Director, Office of Classification and the Associate Under Secretary of Environment, Health, Safety and Security consider the presumptions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section before applying the criteria in ยง 1045.70. These presumptions concern information in certain but not all nuclear-related areas that may generally be presumed to be RD or are generally unclassified. The term "generally" here means that as a rule, but not necessarily in every case, the information in the identified area is presumed classified or not classified as indicated. Inclusion of specific existing information in one of the presumption categories does not mean that new information in a category is or is not classified, but only that arguments to differ from the presumed classification status of the information should use the appropriate presumption as a starting point.

(b) Information in the following areas is presumed to be RD:

(1) Detailed designs, specifications, and functional descriptions of nuclear explosives, whether in the active stockpile or retired;

(2) Material properties under conditions achieved in nuclear explosions that are principally useful only for design and analysis of nuclear weapons;

(3) Vulnerabilities of U.S. nuclear weapons to sabotage, countermeasures, or unauthorized use;
