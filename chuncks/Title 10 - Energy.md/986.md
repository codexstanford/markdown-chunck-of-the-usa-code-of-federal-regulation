###### et seq.

(c) When the reports of investigation of an individual contain information reasonably tending to establish the truth of one or more of the items in the criteria, such information shall be regarded as derogatory and shall create a question as to the individual's eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance. A question concerning the eligibility of an individual for access authorization and/or employment clearance shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in ยง 10.20

(d) In resolving a question concerning the eligibility or continued eligibility of an individual for access authorization and/or employment clearance, the following principles shall be applied by the Director, Division of Facilities and Security, Hearing Examiners, and the NRC Personnel Security Review Panel:

(1) Information reasonably tending to establish the truth of one or more of the items in the criteria shall be the basis for recommending denial or revocation of access authorization and/or employment clearance unless evidence to support faith in the individual's reliability and trust-worthiness is affirmatively shown.

(2) When deemed material to the deliberations, the extent of the activity, conduct, or condition, the period in which they occurred or existed, the length of time which has since elapsed, and the attitude and convictions of the individual shall be considered in determining whether the recommendation will be adverse or favorable.
