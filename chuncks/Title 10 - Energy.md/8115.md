(s)(1) If a basic model includes individual models with components listed at table 1 to ยง 429.43(a)(3)(i)(A) and DOE is not able to obtain an individual model with the least number (which could be zero) of those components within an otherwise comparable model group (as defined in ยง 429.43(a)(3)(i)(A)()), DOE may test any individual model within the otherwise comparable model group.

(2) If the manufacturer certified testing in accordance with Option 1 using default VERS exhaust air transfer ratio (EATR) values or Option 2 using default VERS effectiveness and EATR values, DOE may determine the integrated seasonal moisture removal efficiency 2 (ISMRE2) and/or the integrated seasonal coefficient of performance 2 (ISCOP2) using the default values or by conducting testing to determine VERS performance according to the DOE test procedure in appendix B to subpart F of part 431 of this chapter (with the minimum purge angle and zero pressure differential between supply and return air).

(3) If the manufacturer certified testing in accordance with Option 1 using VERS exhaust air transfer ratio (EATR) values or Option 2 using VERS effectiveness and EATR values determined using an analysis tool certified in accordance with the DOE test procedure in appendix B to subpart F of part 431 of this chapter, DOE may conduct its own testing to determine VERS performance in accordance with the DOE test procedure in appendix B to subpart F of part 431 of this chapter.
