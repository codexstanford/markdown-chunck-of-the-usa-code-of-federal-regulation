####### Average full-load efficiency

means the arithmetic mean of the full-load efficiencies of a population of small electric motors of duplicate design, where the full-load efficiency of each motor in the population is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the motor's useful power output to its total power input when the motor is operated at its full rated load, rated voltage, and rated frequency.
