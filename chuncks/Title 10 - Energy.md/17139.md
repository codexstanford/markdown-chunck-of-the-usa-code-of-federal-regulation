###### Covenants.

(c)Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property, structures, improvements on or interests in the property, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest in the property from the Department:

(1) The instrument effecting or recording this transfer is to contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits; or

(2) Where no transfer of property is involved or imposed with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.

(3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the covenant is to also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a material breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property manages to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new or improvement of existing facilities on the property for the purpose for which the property was transferred, the Director may, upon request of the transferee and, if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions, as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of the right to revert title for so long as the lien of the mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.
