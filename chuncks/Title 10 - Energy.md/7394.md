####### Independent

means, in the context of a nationally recognized certification program, or accreditation program for electric motors, an entity that is not controlled by, or under common control with, electric motor manufacturers, importers, private labelers, or vendors, and that has no affiliation, financial ties, or contractual agreements, apparently or otherwise, with such entities that would:

(i) Hinder the ability of the program to evaluate fully or report the measured or calculated energy efficiency of any electric motor, or

(ii) Create any potential or actual conflict of interest that would undermine the validity of said evaluation. For purposes of this definition, financial ties or contractual agreements between an electric motor manufacturer, importer, private labeler or vendor and a nationally recognized certification program, or accreditation program exclusively for certification or accreditation services does not negate an otherwise independent relationship.
