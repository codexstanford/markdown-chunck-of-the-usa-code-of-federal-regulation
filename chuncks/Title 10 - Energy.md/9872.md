###### 2.3.2 Propane gas.

For a propane-gas-fueled vented heater, maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at an inlet pressure of 11 to 13 inches water column. If the heater is equipped with a gas pressure regulator, maintain the regulator outlet pressure within the greater of +/-0.2 inches water column, or +/-10 percent, of the manufacturer's specified manifold pressure on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual. Use propane having a specific gravity between 1.522 and 1.574 and a higher heating value within +/-5 percent of 2,500 Btu per standard cubic foot. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot for the propane to be used in the test. If the burner cannot be adjusted to obtain a heat input rate of within +/-2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual, as required by section 2.4.1 of this appendix, maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at an inlet test pressure immediately ahead of all controls at any value within the range specified on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual that results in a heat input rate of within +/-2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual.
