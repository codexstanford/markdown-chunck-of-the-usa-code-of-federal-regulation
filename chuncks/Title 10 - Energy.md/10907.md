####### Indoor airflow testing and adjustment.

(6)(i) When testing full-capacity cooling operation at the required external static pressure condition, the full-load indoor airflow rate must be within +/- 3 percent of the certified-rated airflow at full-capacity cooling operation. If the indoor airflow rate at the required minimum external pressure is outside the +/- 3-percent tolerance, the unit and/or test setup must be adjusted such that both the airflow and ESP are within the required tolerances. This process may include, but is not limited to, adjusting any adjustable motor sheaves, adjusting variable drive settings, or adjusting the code tester fan.
