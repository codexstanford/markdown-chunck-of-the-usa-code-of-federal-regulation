####### Active mode cycle.

4.1

The active mode energy consumption measurement requirements described in section 4.1 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers. Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable:

(a) After the completion of each test cycle (sensor heavy response, sensor medium response, and sensor light response), the test load shall be scored according to section 4.2 of this appendix and its cleaning index calculated according to section 5.1 of this appendix.

(b) A test cycle is considered valid if its cleaning index is 70 or higher; otherwise, the test cycle is invalid and the data from that test run is discarded.

(c) For soil-sensing dishwashers, if the test cycle at any soil load is invalid, clean the dishwasher filter according to manufacturer's instructions and repeat the test at that soil load on the most energy-intensive cycle (determined as provided in section 4.1.1 of this appendix) that achieves a cleaning index of 70 or higher.

(d) For non-soil-sensing dishwashers, perform testing as described in section 4.1.a through 4.1.c of this appendix, except that, if a test cycle at a given soil load meets the cleaning index threshold criteria of 70 when tested on the normal cycle, no further testing is required for test cycles at lesser soil loads.
