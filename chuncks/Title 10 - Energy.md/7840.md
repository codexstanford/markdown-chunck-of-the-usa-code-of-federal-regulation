###### ยง 429.70 Alternative methods for determining energy efficiency and energy use.
####### Alternative efficiency determination method (AEDM) for commercial HVAC & WH products (excluding air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with less than 65,000 Btu/h cooling capacity), and commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers,Criteria an AEDM must satisfy.

(c)-(1)A manufacturer may not apply an AEDM to a basic model to determine its efficiency pursuant to this section unless:

(i) The AEDM is derived from a mathematical model that estimates the energy efficiency or energy consumption characteristics of the basic model as measured by the applicable DOE test procedure;

(ii) The AEDM is based on engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, or other analytic evaluation of performance data; and

(iii) The manufacturer has validated the AEDM, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section with basic models that meet the current Federal energy conservation standards.
