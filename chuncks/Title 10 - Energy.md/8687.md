####### i.e.,

1.13 "Initial moisture content" ("IMC") means the ratio of the weight of water contained by the damp test load (prior to completion of the drying cycle) to the bone-dry weight of the test load, expressed as a percent.

1.14 "Inactive mode" means a standby mode that facilitates the activation of active mode by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer, or that provides continuous status display.

1.15 "Moisture content" means the ratio of the weight of water contained by the test load to the bone-dry weight of the test load, expressed as a percent.

1.16 "Off mode" means a mode in which the clothes dryer is connected to a main power source and is not providing any active or standby mode function, and where the mode may persist for an indefinite time. An indicator that only shows the user that the product is in the off position is included within the classification of an off mode.

1.17 "Standard size" means a clothes dryer with a drum capacity of 4.4 cubic feet or greater.

1.18 "Standby mode" means any product modes where the energy using product is connected to a mains power source and offers one or more of the following user-oriented or protective functions which may persist for an indefinite time:

(a) To facilitate the activation of other modes (including activation or deactivation of active mode) by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer.
