Attach to the outlet of vented heaters having a horizontally discharging draft diverter or draft hood outlet a 90-degree elbow, and a five (5) foot long vertical test stack. A horizontal section of pipe may be used on the floor furnace between the diverter and the elbow, if necessary, to clear any framing used in the installation. Use the minimum length of pipe possible for this section. Use stack, elbow, and horizontal section with same cross-sectional area as the diverter outlet.
