###### Thermal Annealing Results Report.

(d)Every licensee that either completes a thermal annealing, or that terminates an annealing but elects to take full or partial credit for the annealing, shall provide the following information within three months of completing the thermal anneal, unless an extension is authorized by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation:

(1) The time and temperature profiles of the actual thermal annealing;

(2) The post-anneal RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy values of the reactor vessel materials for use in subsequent reactor operation;

(3) The projected post-anneal reembrittlement trends for both RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy; and

(4) The projected values of RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy at the end of the proposed period of operation addressed in the Thermal Annealing Report.
