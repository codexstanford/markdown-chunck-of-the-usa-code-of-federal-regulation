####### 3.,Ambient Room Temperature.

3.During the soak-in period and the standby loss test, maintain the ambient room temperature at 75 &#xB0;F +/- 10 &#xB0;F at all times. Measure the ambient room temperature at 1-minute intervals during these periods, except for the soak-in period. Measure the ambient room temperature once before beginning the soak-in period, and ensure no actions are taken during the soak-in period that would cause the ambient room temperature to deviate from the allowable range. Measure the ambient room temperature at the vertical mid-point of the water heater and approximately 2 feet from the water heater jacket. Shield the sensor against radiation. Calculate the average ambient room temperature for the standby loss test. During the standby loss test, the ambient room temperature must not vary by more than +/- 5.0 &#xB0;F at any reading from the average ambient room temperature.
