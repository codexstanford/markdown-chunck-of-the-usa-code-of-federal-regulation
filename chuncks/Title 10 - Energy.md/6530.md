(6) Zirconium tubes,, zirconium metal and alloys in the form of tubes or assemblies of tubes especially designed or prepared for use as fuel cladding in a nuclear reactor.

(7) Reactor internals, e.g., core support structures, control and rod guide tubes, fuel channels, calandria tubes, thermal shields, baffles, core grid plates, and diffuser plates especially designed or prepared for use in a nuclear reactor.

(8) Reactor control rod drive mechanisms, including detection and measuring equipment to determine neutron flux levels within the core of a nuclear reactor.

(9) Heat exchangers, e.g., steam generators especially designed or prepared for the primary, or intermediate, coolant circuit of a nuclear reactor or heat exchangers especially designed or prepared for use in the primary coolant circuit of a nuclear reactor.

(10) External thermal shields especially designed or prepared for use in a nuclear reactor for reduction of heat loss and also for containment vessel protection.

(11) Any other components especially designed or prepared for use in a nuclear reactor or in any of the components described in this appendix.
