###### Absolute humidity for refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.

5.5Calculate the absolute humidity of the air entering and leaving the refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifier in the process air stream, expressed in pounds of water per cubic foot of air, according to the following set of equations.

5.5.1 Temperature in Kelvin. The air dry-bulb temperature, in Kelvin, is:

5.5.2 Water saturation pressure. The water saturation pressure, expressed in kilopascals (kPa), is:

5.5.3 Vapor pressure. The water vapor pressure, expressed in kilopascals (kPa), is:

5.5.4 Mixing humidity ratio. The mixing humidity ratio, the mass of water per mass of dry air, is:

5.5.5 Specific volume. The specific volume, expressed in feet cubed per pounds of dry air, is:

5.5.6 Absolute humidity. The absolute humidity, expressed in pounds of water per cubic foot of air, is:
