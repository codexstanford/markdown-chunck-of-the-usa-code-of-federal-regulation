(ii) For electric furnaces, excluding electric boilers, determine AFUE in accordance with section 11.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-1993 (incorporated by reference,ยง 430.3); for electric boilers, determine AFUE in accordance with section 11.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-2017 (incorporated by reference,ยง 430.3).

(iii) Round the AFUE to one-tenth of a percentage point.

(3) The estimated regional annual operating cost for furnaces is calculated as follows:

(i) When using appendix N of this subpart for furnaces excluding low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers (see the note at the beginning of appendix N of this subpart),

(A) For gas or oil-fueled furnaces,

(B) For electric furnaces,

(ii) When using appendix EE of this subpart for low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers (see the note at the beginning of appendix EE of this subpart),

(A) For gas or oil-fueled boilers,

(B) For electric boilers,

(iii) Round the estimated regional annual operating cost to the nearest dollar per year.

(4) The energy factor for furnaces, expressed in percent, is the ratio of annual fuel output of useful energy delivered to the heated space to the total annual energy input to the furnace determined according to either section 10.6 of appendix N of this subpart (for furnaces, excluding low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) or section 10.4 of appendix EE of this subpart (for low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers), as applicable.

(5) The average standby mode and off mode electrical power consumption for furnaces shall be determined according to section 8.10 of appendix N of this subpart (for furnaces, excluding low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) or section 8.9 of appendix EE of this subpart (for low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers), as applicable. Round the average standby mode and off mode electrical power consumption to the nearest tenth of a watt.

(6) Other useful measures of energy consumption for furnaces shall be those measures of energy consumption which the Secretary determines are likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and which are derived from the application of appendix N of this subpart (for furnaces, excluding low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers) or appendix EE of this subpart (for low pressure steam or hot water boilers and electric boilers).
