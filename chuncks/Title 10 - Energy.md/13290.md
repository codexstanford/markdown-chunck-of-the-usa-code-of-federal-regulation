###### § 600.16 Legal authority and effect of an award.

(a) A DOE financial assistance award is valid only if it is in writing and is signed, either in writing or electronically, by a DOE Contracting Officer.

(b) Recipients are free to accept or reject the award. A request to draw down DOE funds constitutes acceptance; however, DOE may require formal acceptance of an award.

(c) DOE funds awarded under a grant, cooperative agreement, or technology investment agreement shall be obligated as of the date the DOE Contracting Officer signs the award; however, the recipient is not authorized to incur costs under an award prior to the beginning date of the budget period shown in the award except as may be authorized in accordance with §§ 600.125(e), 600.230, 600.317(b), or 603.830 of this part. The duration of the DOE financial obligation shall not extend beyond the expiration date of the budget period shown in the award unless authorized by a DOE Contracting Officer by means of a continuation or renewal award or other extension of the budget period.
