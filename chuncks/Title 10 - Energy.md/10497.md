8.10.2If the unit is equipped with an off switch or there is an expected difference between off mode power and standby mode power, measure off mode power (P,) in accordance with the standby power procedures in IEC 62301, except that section 8.5,of ASHRAE 103-2017 and the voltage provision of section 8.2.1.4,of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall apply in lieu of the corresponding provisions of IEC 62301 at section 4.2,and the voltage specification of section 4.3,Frequency shall be 60Hz. Clarifying further, IEC 62301 section 4.4,and section 5,apply for this measurement in lieu of SHRAE 103-2017 section 6.10,Measure the wattage so that all possible off mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the off mode wattage of a single auxiliary. If there is no expected difference in off mode power and standby mode power, let P= P, in which case no separate measurement of off mode power is necessary. Round the recorded off mode power (P) to the second decimal place, except for loads greater than or equal to 10W, in which case round the recorded value to at least three significant figures.
