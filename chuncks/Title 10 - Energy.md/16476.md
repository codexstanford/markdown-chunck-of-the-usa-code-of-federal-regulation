##### Search

(o)includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. The DOE will search for material in the most efficient and least expensive manner in order to minimize cost for both DOE and the requester. For example, DOE will not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. "Search" will be distinguished, moreover, from "review" of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.
