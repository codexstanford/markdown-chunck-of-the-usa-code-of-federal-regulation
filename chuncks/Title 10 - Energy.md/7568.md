###### § 429.35 Compact fluorescent lamps.
####### Certification reports.

(b)(1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to compact fluorescent lamps; and

(2) Values reported in certification reports are represented values. Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:

(i) For each basic model of medium base CFL when certifying compliance to the standards in § 430.32(u) as it appeared in 10 CFR parts 200-499 edition revised as of January 1, 2016, the testing laboratory's ILAC accreditation body's identification number or other approved identification assigned by the ILAC accreditation body, the date of first manufacture, the seasoning time in hours (h), the initial lumen output in lumens (lm), the input power in watts (W), the initial lamp efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W), the number of sample units replaced during the seasoning period within each unique sample set used in determining the represented value, the lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime in percent (%) (and whether value is estimated), the lifetime in hours (h) (and whether value is estimated), life in years (and whether value is estimated), the lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours in percent (%), and the results of rapid cycle stress testing in number of units passed. or the initial certification of new basic models or any subsequent certification based on new testing, estimates of lifetime, life, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, and rapid cycle stress test surviving units may be reported (if indicated in the certification report) until testing is complete. When reporting estimated values, the certification report must specifically describe the prediction method, which must be generally representative of the methods specified in appendix W. Manufacturers are required to maintain records in accordance with § 429.71 of the development of all estimated values and any associated initial test data.

(ii) For each basic model of integrated CFL when certifying compliance with general service lamp energy conservation standards, the testing laboratory's ILAC accreditation body's identification number or other identification assigned by the ILAC accreditation body, the date of first manufacture, a statement that the compact fluorescent lamp is integrated, the seasoning time in hours (h), the initial lumen output in lumens (lm), the input power in watts (W), the initial lamp efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W), the CCT in kelvin (K), CRI, the lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours in percent (%), the lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime in percent (%) (and whether value is estimated), start time in milliseconds, power factor, standby mode energy consumption in watts (W), the results of rapid cycle stress testing in number of units passed, the lifetime in hours (h) (and whether value is estimated), life in years (and whether value is estimated), and the number of sample units replaced during the seasoning period within the sample set used in determining the represented value. Estimates of lifetime, life, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, and rapid cycle stress test surviving units may be reported (if indicated in the certification report) until testing is complete. When reporting estimated values, the certification report must specifically describe the prediction method, which must be generally representative of the methods specified in appendix W. Manufacturers are required to maintain records in accordance with § 429.71 of the development of all estimated values and any associated initial test data.

(iii) For each basic model of non-integrated CFL when certifying compliance with general service lamp energy conservation standards, the testing laboratory's ILAC accreditation body's identification number or other identification assigned by the ILAC accreditation body, the date of first manufacture, a statement that the compact fluorescent lamp is non-integrated, the initial lumen output in lumens (lm), the input power in watts (W), the initial lamp efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W), the CCT in kelvin (K), CRI, the lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime in percent (%) (and whether value is estimated), the lifetime in hours (h) (and whether value is estimated), and the number of sample units replaced during the seasoning period within each unique sample set used in determining the represented value. Estimates of lifetime and lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime may be reported (if indicated in the certification report) until testing is complete. When reporting estimated values, the certification report must specifically describe the prediction method, which must be generally representative of the methods specified in appendix W. Manufacturers are required to maintain records in accordance with § 429.71 of the development of all estimated values and any associated initial test data.
