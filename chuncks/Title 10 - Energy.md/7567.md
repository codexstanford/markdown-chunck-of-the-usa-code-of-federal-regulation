() Based on a lifetime value that is equal to or greater than the represented value of lifetime.

(2) The represented value of life (in years) of a compact fluorescent lamp must be calculated by dividing the represented lifetime of a compact fluorescent lamp as determined in (a)(1) of this section by the estimated annual operating hours as specified in 16 CFR 305.15(b)(3)(iii).

(3) The represented value of the estimated annual energy cost for a compact fluorescent lamp, expressed in dollars per year, must be the product of the input power in kilowatts, an electricity cost rate as specified in 16 CFR 305.15(b)(1)(ii), and an estimated average annual use as specified in 16 CFR 305.15(b)(1)(ii).

(4) For compliance with standards specified in ยง 430.32(u) as it appeared in 10 CFR parts 200-499 edition revised as of January 1, 2016, initial lamp efficacy may include a 3 percent tolerance added to the value determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.

(5) The represented value of lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime must be based on a lifetime value that is equal to or greater than the represented value of lifetime.

(6) Estimated values may be used for representations when initially testing a new basic model or when new/additional testing is required.
