####### Cogeneration

means the utilization of surplus energy, e.g., steam, heat or hot water produced as a by-product of the manufacture of some other form of energy, such as electricity. Thus, diesel generators are converted to cogeneration sets when they are equipped with boilers that make steam and hot water (usable as energy) from the heat of the exhaust and the water that cools the generator.
