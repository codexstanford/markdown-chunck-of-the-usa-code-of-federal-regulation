1.11means a ballast that has an Underwriters Laboratories Inc. Type 2 rating and is designed and marketed for use only in outdoor signs.

2.1. Where ANSI C82.2 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3) references ANSI C82.1, use ANSI C82.1 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3) for testing low-frequency ballasts and use ANSI C82.11 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3) for testing high-frequency ballasts. In addition when applying ANSI C82.2, use the standards ANSI C78.375A, ANSI C78.81-2016, ANSI C82.1, ANSI C82.11, ANSI C82.13, ANSI C82.3, ANSI C82.77, and ANSI C78.901-2016 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3) instead of the normative references in ANSI 82.2. Specifications in referenced standards that are recommended, that "shall" or "should" be met, or that are not clearly mandatory, are mandatory. In cases where there is a conflict between any industry standard(s) and this appendix, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over the industry standard(s).

2.2.1. All instruments must meet the specifications of section 9 of ANSI C78.375A.
