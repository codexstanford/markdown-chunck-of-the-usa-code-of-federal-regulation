3.2.2

Record the winding temperature (T) of dry-type transformers as one of the following:

(a) For ventilated dry-type units, use the average of readings of four or more thermometers, thermocouples, or other suitable temperature sensors inserted within the coils. Place the sensing points of the measuring devices as close as possible to the winding conductors; or

(b) For sealed units, such as epoxy-coated or epoxy-encapsulated units, use the average of four or more temperature sensors located on the enclosure and/or cover, as close to different parts of the winding assemblies as possible; or

(c) For ventilated units or sealed units, use the ambient temperature of the test area, only if the following conditions are met:

(1) All internal temperatures measured by the internal temperature sensors must not differ from the test area ambient temperature by more than 2 &#xB0;C. Enclosure surface temperatures for sealed units must not differ from the test area ambient temperature by more than 2 &#xB0;C.

(2) Test area ambient temperature must not have changed by more than 3 &#xB0;C for 3 hours before the test.
