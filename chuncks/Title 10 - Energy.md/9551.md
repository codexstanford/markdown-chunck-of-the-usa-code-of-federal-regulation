And %FLAVR is the air volume rate used for the test, expressed as a percentage of the cooling full load air volume rate. For all tests specifying the full-load air volume rate (the Aand Btests), set %FLAVR to 100%. For tests that specify the cooling minimum air volume rate or cooling intermediate air volume rate (the A, B, E, and Ftests) and for which the specified minimum or intermediate air volume rate is greater than or equal to 75 percent of the cooling full-load air volume rate and less than the cooling full-load air volume rate, set %FLAVR to the ratio of the specified air volume rate and the cooling full-load air volume rate, expressed as a percentage.
