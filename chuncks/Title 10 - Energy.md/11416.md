####### Temperature Stabilization.

2.1.1.1.Temperature stabilization shall be determined in accordance with section 7.2.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 32.1 (incorporated by reference ยง 431.293), except that the reference to "average beverage temperature" shall instead refer to the "instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature," as defined in section 1.2 of this appendix, and the reference to "Table 1" shall instead refer to Table A.1 of this appendix. That is, temperature stabilization is considered to be achieved 24 hours after the instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature reaches the specified value (see Table A.1) and energy consumption for two successive 6 hour periods are within 2 percent of each other.
