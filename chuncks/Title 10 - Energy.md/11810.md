###### Appendix A to Subpart Y of Part 431 - Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Consumption of Pumps
####### Measurement Equipment.

B.The requirements regarding measurement equipment presented in section I.B of this appendix apply to this section IV, and in addition, the electrical measurement equipment must:

(1) Be capable of measuring true RMS current, true RMS voltage, and real power up to the 40th harmonic of fundamental supply source frequency, and

(2) For all instruments used to measure a given parameter, have a combined accuracy of +/-2.0 percent of the measured value at the fundamental supply source frequency, where combined accuracy is the root sum of squares of individual instrument accuracies.
