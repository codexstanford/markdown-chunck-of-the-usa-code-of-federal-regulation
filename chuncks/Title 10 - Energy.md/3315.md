() For buried pipe locations where the loss of material has occurred due to internal corrosion, the wall thickness examinations may be conducted at a different location in the same system as long as: Wall thickness measurements were conducted at the different location at the same time as installation of the modification; the flow rate is the same or higher at the different location; the piping configuration is the same (straight run of pipe, elbow, tee); and if pitting occurred at the modification location, but not the different location, wall loss values must be multiplied by four (instead of two) times the actual measured corrosion rate. Where wall loss values are greater than that assumed during the design of the modification, the structural integrity of the modification must be reanalyzed. Additionally, if the extent of degradation is different (percent wall loss plus or minus 25 percent) or the corrosion mechanism (general, pitting) is not the same at the different location as at the modification location, the modification must be examined at half its expected life or 10 years, whichever is sooner.
