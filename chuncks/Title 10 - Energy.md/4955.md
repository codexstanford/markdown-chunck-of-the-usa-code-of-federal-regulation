(ii) Six months of the change if it pertains to uranium enriched less than 20 percent in the uranium-235 isotope, or plutonium containing 80 percent or more by weight of the isotope Pu-238.

(d) The licensee shall make no change which would decrease the effectiveness of the plan for physical protection of special nuclear material in transit prepared pursuant to § 70.22(g) or § 73.20(c) of this chapter without the prior approval of the Commission.
