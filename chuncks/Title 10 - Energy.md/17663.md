###### Color vision.

(6)Ability to distinguish red, green, and yellow. Acceptable measures of color discrimination include the Ishihara; Hardy, Rand, & Rittler; and Dvorine pseudoisochromatic plates (PIP) when administered and scored according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tinted lenses such as the X-Chrom contact lenses or tinted spectacle lenses effectively alter the standard illumination required for all color vision tests, thereby invalidating the results and are not permitted during color vision testing.
