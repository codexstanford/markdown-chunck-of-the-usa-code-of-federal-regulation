####### ยง 431.324 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency and standby mode energy consumption of metal halide lamp ballasts.
######## Calculations.

(iii)(A) To determine the percent efficiency of the ballast under test, divide the measured ballast output (lamp) power, as measured in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, by the measured ballast input power, as measured in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Calculate percent efficiency to three significant figures.

(B) [Reserved]
