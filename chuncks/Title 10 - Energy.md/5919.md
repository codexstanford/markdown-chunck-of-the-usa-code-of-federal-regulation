###### General performance objectives.

(a)Each licensee who is authorized by this chapter to possess equipment capable of enriching uranium or operate an enrichment facility, and produce, possess, or use more than one effective kilogram of special nuclear material of low strategic significance at any site or contiguous sites, subject to control by the licensee, shall establish, implement, and maintain a NRC-approved material control and accounting system that will achieve the following objectives:

(2) Protect against and detect production of uranium enriched to 10 percent or more in the isotope U;

(3) Protect against and detect unauthorized production of uranium of low strategic significance;

(4) Resolve indications of missing uranium;

(5) Resolve indications of production of uranium enriched to 10 percent or more in the isotope U(for centrifuge enrichment facilities this requirement does not apply to each cascade during its start-up process, not to exceed the first 24 hours);

(6) Resolve indications of unauthorized production of uranium of low strategic significance;

(7) Provide information to aid in the investigation of missing uranium;

(8) Provide information to aid in the investigation of the production of uranium enriched to 10 percent or more in the isotope U; and

(9) Provide information to aid in the investigation of unauthorized production of uranium of low strategic significance.
