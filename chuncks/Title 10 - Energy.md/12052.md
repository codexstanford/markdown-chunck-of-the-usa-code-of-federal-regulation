####### Prescriptive Criteria.

402.4.1(a) The exterior wall shall be designed in accordance with subsections 402.4.1.1 and 402.4.1.2. When the internal load density range is not known, the 0-1.50 W/ftrange shall be used for residential, hotel/motel guest rooms, or warehouse occupancies; the 3.01-3.50 w/ftrange shall be used for retail stores smaller than 2,000 ftand technical and vocational schools smaller than 10,000 ft; and the 1.51-3.00 W/ftrange shall be used for all other occupancies and building sizes. When the building envelope is designed or constructed prior to knowing the building occupancy type, an internal load density of ______ W/ftshall be used. [Use 3.0 W/ftfor HDD65 <3000, 2.25 W/ftfor 3000 <HDD65 <6000, and 1.5 W/ftfor HDD65 >6000.]

(b) When more than one condition exists, area weighted averages shall be used. This requirement shall apply to all thermal transmittances, shading coefficients, projection factors, and internal load densities rounded to the same number of decimal places as shown in the respective table.
