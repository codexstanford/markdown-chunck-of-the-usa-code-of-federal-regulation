###### Velocity pressure.

3.1.2.2.3.2Measure velocity pressures using the same pitot traverses as used for measuring external static pressure, and which are specified in section 3.1.2.2.3.1 of this appendix. Determine velocity pressures at each pitot-static tube in a traverse as the difference between the pressure at the impact pressure tap and the pressure at the static pressure tap. Calculate volumetric flow rates in each duct in accordance with Section 7.3.1, "Velocity Traverse," of ANSI/AMCA 210 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3).
