###### § 429.12 General requirements applicable to certification reports.
####### Certification report.

(b)A certification report shall include a compliance statement (see paragraph (c) of this section), and for each basic model, the information listed in this paragraph (b).

(1) Product or equipment type;

(2) Product or equipment class (as denoted in the provisions of part 430 or 431 of this chapter containing the applicable energy conservation standard);

(3) Manufacturer's name and address;

(4) Private labeler's name(s) and address(es) (if applicable);

(5) Brand name;

(6) For each brand, the basic model number and the manufacturer's individual model number(s) in that basic model with the following exceptions: For external power supplies that are certified based on design families, the design family model number and the individual manufacturer's model numbers covered by that design family must be submitted for each brand. For distribution transformers, the basic model number or kVA grouping model number (depending on the certification method) for each brand must be submitted. For commercial HVAC, WH, and refrigeration equipment, an individual manufacturer model number may be identified as a "private model number" if it meets the requirements of § 429.7(b).

(7) Whether the submission is for a new model, a discontinued model, a correction to a previously submitted model, data on a carryover model, or a model that has been found in violation of a voluntary industry certification program;

(8) The test sample size as follows:

(i) The number of units tested for the basic model; or

(ii) In the case of single-split system or single-package central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps; air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h; air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h; or multi-split, multi-circuit, or multi-head mini-split systems other than the "tested combination," the number of units tested for each individual combination or individual model; or

(iii) If an AEDM was used in lieu of testing, enter "0" (and in the case of central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps, this must be indicated separately for each metric);

(9) The certifying party's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) importer identification numbers assigned by CBP pursuant to 19 CFR 24.5, if applicable;

(10) Whether certification is based upon any waiver of test procedure requirements under § 430.27 or § 431.401 of this chapter and the date(s) of such waiver(s);

(11) Whether certification is based upon any exception relief from an applicable energy conservation standard and the date such relief was issued by DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals;

(12) If the test sample size is listed as "0" to indicate the certification is based upon the use of an alternate way of determining measures of energy conservation, identify the method used for determining measures of energy conservation (such as "AEDM," or linear interpolation). Manufacturers of commercial packaged boilers, commercial water heating equipment, commercial refrigeration equipment, commercial HVAC equipment, and central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps must provide the manufacturer's designation (name or other identifier) of the AEDM used; and

(13) Product specific information listed in §§ 429.14 through 429.63 of this chapter.
