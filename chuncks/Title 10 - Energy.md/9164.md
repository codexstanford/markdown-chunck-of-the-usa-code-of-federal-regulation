###### Appendix J to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Automatic and Semi-Automatic Clothes Washers
####### Energy consumption for the purpose of determining the cycle selection(s) to be included in the energy test cycle.

3.6This section is implemented only in cases where the energy test cycle flowcharts in section 2.12.1 of this appendix require the determination of the wash/rinse temperature selection with the highest energy consumption.

3.6.1 For the wash/rinse temperature selection being considered under this section, establish the testing conditions set forth in section 2 of this appendix. Select the applicable cycle selection and wash/rinse temperature selection. For all wash/rinse temperature selections, select the cycle settings as described in section 3.2 of this appendix.

3.6.2 Measure each wash cycle's electrical energy consumption (E) and hot water consumption (H). Calculate the total energy consumption for each cycle selection (E), as follows:
