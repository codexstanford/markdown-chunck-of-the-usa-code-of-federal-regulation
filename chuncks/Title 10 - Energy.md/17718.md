###### SRT initial training requirements.

(1)Prior to initial assignment to duty, each SRT-qualified SPO must successfully complete the current Department-approved SRT basic qualification course designed to provide at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, and ability needed to competently perform all the identified essential functions of the job and tasks associated with SRT job responsibilities. SPOs who have previously successfully completed the SRT basic qualification course to work at another DOE facility do not have to retake the SRT basic qualification as determined by a site-specific assessment of the individual. After completion of the SRT basic qualification course, the SRT-qualified SPO must participate in a site-specific training program designed to provide the minimum level of knowledge and skills needed to competently perform all the identified essential functions of the job and tasks associated with site-specific SRT job responsibilities. The site-specific essential functions and minimum levels of competency must be based on a site-specific JA or METL, task areas as specified by DOE, and any other site-specific task areas that will ensure the SRT-qualified SPO's ability to perform all aspects of the assigned position under normal and emergency conditions without posing a direct threat to the SPO or to others.
