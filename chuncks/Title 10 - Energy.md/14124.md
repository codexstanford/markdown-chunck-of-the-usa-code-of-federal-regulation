##### ยง 609.4 Submission of applications.

(a) In response to a Solicitation, an Applicant must meet all requirements and provide all information specified in this part and the Solicitation in the manner and on or before the date specified in the Solicitation. DOE may direct that Applications be submitted in more than one part; provided, that the parts of such Application, taken as a whole, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section and this part. In such event, subsequent parts of an Application may be filed only after DOE invites an Applicant to make an additional submission. If DOE directs that Applications be submitted in more than one part, the initial part of an Application shall contain information sufficient for DOE to determine that the project proposed by an Applicant will be, or may reasonably become, an Eligible Project, and to evaluate such project's readiness to proceed. If there have been any material amendments, modifications, or additions made to the information previously submitted by an Applicant, the Applicant shall provide a detailed description thereof, including any changes in the proposed project's financing structure or other terms, promptly upon request by DOE. Where DOE has directed that an Application be submitted in parts, DOE may provide for payment of the Application Fee in parts.

(b) An Applicant may submit only one Application for one proposed project using a particular technology. An Applicant may not submit an Application or Applications for multiple Eligible Projects using the same technology. An Applicant may submit Applications for multiple proposed projects using different technologies.

(e) During the Application evaluation process pursuant to ยง 609.5, DOE may request additional information, potentially including a preliminary credit rating or credit assessment, with respect to the proposed project.

(f) DOE will not consider any part of any Application or the Application as a whole complete unless the Application Fee (or the required portion of the Application Fee related to a particular part of the Application) has been paid. An Application Fee paid in connection with one Application is not transferable to another Application. Except in the discretion of DOE, no portion of the Application Fee is refundable.

(g) DOE has no obligation to evaluate an Application that is not complete, and may proceed with such evaluation, or a partial evaluation, only in its discretion.

(i) Upon making a determination to engage independent consultants or outside counsel with respect to an Application, DOE will proceed to evaluate and process such Application only following execution by an Applicant or Project Sponsor, as appropriate, of an agreement satisfactory to DOE to pay the fees and expenses charged by the independent consultants and outside legal counsel.

(j) Following a determination by DOE that an Application or, if applicable, the initial part of an Application, adequately describes an Eligible Project, or a project that may reasonably become an Eligible Project, DOE may offer a Preliminary Term Sheet to be utilized by an Applicant for the purpose of obtaining its third party contracts or offtake agreements, or for any other lawful purpose that may reasonably assist an Applicant in obtaining the information or conditional agreements required to complete an Application, subject to any terms and conditions required by DOE and applicable law. DOE may issue a Preliminary Term Sheet only if it determines that an Applicant has shown in an Application or, if applicable, the initial part of an Application, a reasonable likelihood of being able to satisfy the requirements of the Act and enter into a Conditional Commitment, but for the lack of a Preliminary Term Sheet. The Applicant shall be responsible for payment of any fees assessed or costs incurred by DOE that are associated with the issuance of the Preliminary Term Sheet. Notwithstanding any provision of a Preliminary Term Sheet to the contrary, the issuance of a Preliminary Term Sheet shall impose no obligation on DOE to proceed with an Application, or to enter into a Conditional Commitment, which matters shall be governed exclusively by the Act and the requirements set forth in ยง 609.5. Further, DOE may, in its sole discretion, terminate or rescind a Preliminary Term Sheet should an Applicant fail to meet any of the terms and conditions required therein.

(k) At any time in the lending process, the Secretary of Energy may exercise his deviation authority under ยง 609.16 to make such deviations from this part as he may deem to be in the best interests of DOE, where such deviation supports program objectives and the special circumstances stated in any deviation request are clearly in the best interests of the Government.

(l) DOE shall respond, in writing, to any inquiry by an Applicant about the status of its Application within ten (10) business days of receipt of such request.
