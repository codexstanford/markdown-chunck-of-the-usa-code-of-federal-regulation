####### Public product-specific information.

(2)Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), for each individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split-systems, including outdoor units with no match and "tested combinations" for multi-split, multi-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems), a certification report must include the following public product-specific information: When certifying compliance with January 1, 2015, energy conservation standards, the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/W-h)) or when certifying compliance with January 1, 2023, energy conservation standards, seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 (SEER2 in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/W-h)); the average off mode power consumption (Pin Watts); the cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); the region(s) in which the basic model can be sold; when certifying compliance with January 1, 2023, energy conservation standards, the kind(s) of air conditioner or heat pump associated with the minimum external static pressure used in testing or rating (ceiling-mount, wall-mount, mobile home, low-static, mid-static, small duct high velocity, space-constrained, or conventional/not otherwise listed); and

(i) For heat pumps, when certifying compliance with January 1, 2015, energy conservation standards, the heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/W-h)) or, when certifying compliance with January 1, 2023, energy conservation standards, heating seasonal performance factor 2 (HSPF2 in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/W-h));

(ii) For central air conditioners (excluding space-constrained products), when certifying compliance with January 1, 2015, energy conservation standards, the energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/W-h)) from the A or Atest, whichever applies, or when certifying compliance with January 1, 2023, energy conservation standards, the energy efficiency ratio 2 (EER2 in Btu/W-h);

(iii) For single-split-systems, whether the represented value is for a coil-only or blower coil system;

(iv) For multi-split, multiple-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems (including VRF and SDHV), when certifying compliance with January 1, 2015, energy conservation standards, whether the represented value is for a non-ducted, ducted, mixed non-ducted/ducted system, SDHV, mixed non-ducted/SDHV system, or mixed ducted/SDHV system;

(v) For all split systems including outdoor units with no match, the refrigerant.
