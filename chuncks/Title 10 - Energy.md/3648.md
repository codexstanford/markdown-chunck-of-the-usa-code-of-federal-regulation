###### Caveats about State consultation.

(c)(1) The State consultation procedures in paragraph (b) of this section do not give the State a right:

(i) To veto the Commission's proposed or final determination;

(ii) To a hearing on the determination before the amendment becomes effective; or

(iii) To insist upon a postponement of the determination or upon issuance of the amendment.

(2) These procedures do not alter present provisions of law that reserve to the Commission exclusive responsibility for setting and enforcing radiological health and safety requirements for nuclear power plants.
