### PART 1047 - LIMITED ARREST AUTHORITY AND USE OF FORCE BY PROTECTIVE FORCE OFFICERS
#### General Provisions
##### ยง 1047.4 Arrest authority.
###### Other Authority.

(d)The Act does not provide authority to arrest for violations of state criminal statutes or for violations of federal criminal statutes other than those listed in paragraph (a) of this section. Therefore, arrests for violations of such other criminal statutes shall be made by other peace officers (e.g., U.S. Marshals or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents for federal offenses; LLEA officers for state or local offenses) unless:

(1) The protective force officer can make a citizen's arrest for the criminal offense under the law of the state,

(2) The protective force officer is an authorized state peace officer or otherwise deputized by the particular state to make arrests for state criminal offenses, or

(3) The protective force officer has been deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service or other federal law enforcement agency to make arrests for the criminal offense.

(e) In those locations which are within the "special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States," as defined in 18 U.S.C. 7, the Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. 13) adopts the law of the state for any crime under state law not specifically prohibited by Federal statute and provides for federal enforcement of that state law. The local DOE Office of Chief Counsel, in coordination with contractor legal counsel, as appropriate, shall provide guidance in this matter.
