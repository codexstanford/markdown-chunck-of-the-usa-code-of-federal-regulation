###### Portion markings.

(f)In addition to the information required on the face of the document, each classified document is required, by marking or other means, to indicate clearly which portions are classified (e.g., paragraphs or pages) and which portions are not classified. The symbols (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, (U) for Unclassified, or (RD) for Restricted Data may be used immediately preceding or following the text to which it applies, except that the designation must follow titles or subjects. (Portion marking of paragraphs is not required for documents containing Restricted Data.) If this type of portion marking is not practicable, the document must contain a description sufficient to identify the classified information and the unclassified information.
