8.10.1With all electrical auxiliaries of the furnace not activated, measure the standby power (P) in accordance with the procedures in IEC 62301, except that section 8.5,of ASHRAE 103-1993 and the voltage provision of section 8.2.1.4,of ASHRAE 103-1993 shall apply in lieu of the corresponding provisions of IEC 62301 at section 4.2,and the voltage specification of section 4.3,Frequency shall be 60Hz. Clarifying further, IEC 62301 section 4.4,and Section 5,apply in lieu of ASHRAE 103-1993 section 6.10,Measure the wattage so that all possible standby mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the standby mode wattage of a single auxiliary. Round the recorded standby power (P) to the second decimal place, except for loads greater than or equal to 10W, which must be recorded to at least three significant figures.
