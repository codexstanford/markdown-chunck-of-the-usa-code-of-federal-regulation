###### § 429.37 External power supplies.
####### Certification reports.

(b)(1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to external power supplies except that required information may be reported on the basis of a basic model or a design family. If certifying using a design family, for § 429.12(b)(6), report the individual manufacturer's model numbers covered by the design family.

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:

(i) External power supplies: The average active mode efficiency as a percentage (%), no-load mode power consumption in watts (W), nameplate output power in watts (W), and, if missing from the nameplate, the output current in amperes (A) of the basic model or the output current in amperes (A) of the highest- and lowest-voltage models within the external power supply design family.

(ii) Switch-selectable single-voltage external power supplies: The average active mode efficiency as a percentage (%) value, no-load mode power consumption in watts (W) using the lowest and highest selectable output voltages, nameplate output power in watts (W), and, if missing from the nameplate, the output current in amperes (A).

(iii) Adaptive single-voltage external power supplies: The average active-mode efficiency as a percentage (%) at the highest and lowest nameplate output voltages, no-load mode power consumption in watts (W), nameplate output power in watts (W) at the highest and lowest nameplate output voltages, and, if missing from the nameplate, the output current in amperes (A) at the highest and lowest nameplate output voltages.

(iv) External power supplies that are exempt from no-load mode requirements under § 430.32(w)(5) of this chapter: A statement that the product is designed to be connected to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system component, the average active-mode efficiency as a percentage (%), the nameplate output power in watts (W), and if missing from the nameplate, the certification report must also include the output current in amperes (A) of the basic model or the output current in amperes (A) of the highest- and lowest-voltage models within the external power supply design family.

(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report for external power supplies that are exempt from the energy conservation standards at § 430.32(w)(1)(ii) pursuant to § 430.32(w)(2) of this chapter must include the following additional information if, in aggregate, the total number of exempt EPSs sold as spare and service parts by the certifier exceeds 1,000 units across all models: The total number of units of exempt external power supplies sold during the most recent 12-calendar-month period ending on July 31, starting with the annual report due on September 1, 2017.
