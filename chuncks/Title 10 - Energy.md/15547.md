###### Multiple physician review.

(c)The responsible employer must establish a multiple physician review process for beryllium-associated workers that allows for the review of initial medical findings, determinations, or recommendations from any medical evaluation conducted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

(1) If the responsible employer selects the initial physician to conduct any medical examination or consultation provided to a beryllium-associated worker, the worker may designate a second physician to:

(i) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician; and

(ii) Conduct such examinations, consultations and laboratory tests, as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.

(2) The responsible employer must promptly notify a beryllium-associated worker in writing of the right to seek a second medical opinion after the initial physician provided by the responsible employer conducts a medical examination or consultation.

(3) The responsible employer may condition its participation in, and payment for, multiple physician review upon the beryllium-associated worker doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice, or receipt of the initial physician's written opinion, whichever is later:

(i) Informing the responsible employer in writing that he or she intends to seek a second medical opinion; and

(ii) Initiating steps to make an appointment with a second physician.

(4) If the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the responsible employer and the beryllium-associated worker must make efforts to encourage and assist the two physicians to resolve any disagreement.

(5) If, despite the efforts of the responsible employer and the beryllium-associated worker, the two physicians are unable to resolve their disagreement, then the responsible employer and the worker, through their respective physicians, must designate a third physician to:

(i) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the other two physicians; and

(ii) Conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests, and consultations with the other two physicians, as the third physician deems necessary to resolve the disagreement among them.

(6) The SOMD must act consistently with the findings, determinations, and recommendations of the third physician, unless the SOMD and the beryllium-associated worker reach an agreement that is consistent with the recommendations of at least one of the other two physicians.
