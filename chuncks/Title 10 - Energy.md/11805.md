###### Appendix A to Subpart Y of Part 431 - Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Consumption of Pumps
####### Measurement Equipment.

B.The requirements regarding measurement equipment presented in section I.B of this appendix apply to this section III, and in addition, when testing pumps using a calibrated motor:

(1) Electrical measurement equipment must be capable of measuring true RMS current, true RMS voltage, and real power up to the 40th harmonic of fundamental supply source frequency, and

(2) Any instruments used to measure a particular parameter specified in paragraph (1) must have a combined accuracy of +/-2.0 percent of the measured value at the fundamental supply source frequency, where combined accuracy is the root sum of squares of individual instrument accuracies.
