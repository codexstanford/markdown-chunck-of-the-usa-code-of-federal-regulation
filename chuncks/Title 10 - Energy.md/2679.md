##### ยง 40.34 Special requirements for issuance of specific licenses.

(a) An application for a specific license to manufacture industrial products and devices containing depleted uranium, or to initially transfer such products or devices, for use pursuant to ยง 40.25 of this part or equivalent regulations of an Agreement State, will be approved if:

(1) The applicant satisfies the general requirements specified in ยง 40.32;

(2) The applicant submits sufficient information relating to the design, manufacture, prototype testing, quality control procedures, labeling or marking, proposed uses, and potential hazards of the industrial product or device to provide reasonable assurance that possession, use, or transfer of the depleted uranium in the product or device is not likely to cause any individual to receive in 1 year a radiation dose in excess of 10 percent of the annual limits specified in ยง 20.1201(a) of this chapter; and

(3) The applicant submits sufficient information regarding the industrial product or device and the presence of depleted uranium for a mass-volume application in the product or device to provide reasonable assurance that unique benefits will accrue to the public because of the usefulness of the product or device.

(b) In the case of an industrial product or device whose unique benefits are questionable, the Commission will approve an application for a specific license under this paragraph only if the product or device is found to combine a high degree of utility and low probability of uncontrolled disposal and dispersal of significant quantities of depleted uranium into the environment.

(c) The Commission may deny an applicant for a specific license under this paragraph if the end uses of the industrial product or device cannot be reasonably foreseen.
