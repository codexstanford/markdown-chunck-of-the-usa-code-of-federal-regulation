####### i.e.,

(iii) If the mean of the combined sample (x) is equal to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL) or 95 percent of the applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is greater,if xâ‰¥max (LCL, 0.95 EES), the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.

(f)(1) Compute the upper control limit (UCL) and lower control limit (LCL) for the mean of the first sample using the applicable DOE energy consumption standard (ECS) as the desired mean and a probability level of 95 percent (two-tailed test) as follows:

(2) For an energy or water consumption standard, compare the mean of the first sample (x) with the upper and lower control limits (UCLand LCL) to determine one of the following:

(i) If the mean of the first sample is above the upper control limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)

(ii) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or less than the lower control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)

(iii) If the sample mean is equal to or less than the upper control limit but greater than the lower control limit, then no determination of compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second sample size is determined by Step (f)(3).

(3) For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, determine the second sample size (n) as follows:
