##### ยง 1046.14 Medical certification disqualification.
###### Medical removal protection.

(b)The employer of a disqualified SPO must offer the SPO medical removal protection if the PPMD determines in a written medical opinion that the disqualifying condition occurred as a result of site-approved training for or attempting to meet a physical readiness standard qualification, or site-approved training for security and emergency response (e.g., participating in force-on-force exercises for training, inspection, or validation purposes). The PPMD's determination must be based on an examining physician's recommendation or any other signs or symptoms that the Designated Physician deems medically sufficient to medically disqualify an SPO. The employee pay benefits specified in this section for combined temporary and permanent medical removal shall not be provided for more than one year from the date of the initial PPMD written determination regarding the same basis for disqualification.
