###### Records retention.

(9)The holder of a construction permit, combined license, and manufacturing license must prepare and maintain records necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section, specifically-

(i) Retain procurement documents, which define the requirements that facilities or basic components must meet in order to be considered acceptable, for the lifetime of the facility or basic component.

(ii) Retain records of evaluations of all deviations and failures to comply under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for the longest of:

(A) Ten (10) years from the date of the evaluation;

(B) Five (5) years from the date that an early site permit is referenced in an application for a combined license; or

(C) Five (5) years from the date of delivery of a manufactured reactor.

(iii) Retain records of all interim reports to the Commission made under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, or notifications to the Commission made under paragraph (e)(4) of this section for the minimum time periods stated in paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of this section;

(iv) Suppliers of basic components must retain records of:

(A) All notifications sent to affected licensees or purchasers under paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section for a minimum of ten (10) years following the date of the notification;

(B) The facilities or other purchasers to whom basic components or associated services were supplied for a minimum of fifteen (15) years from the delivery of the basic component or associated services.

(v) Maintaining records in accordance with this section satisfies the recordkeeping obligations under part 21 of this chapter of the entities, including directors or responsible officers thereof, subject to this section.

(f)(1) Each nuclear power plant or fuel reprocessing plant construction permit holder subject to the quality assurance criteria in appendix B of this part shall implement, pursuant to § 50.34(a)(7) of this part, the quality assurance program described or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report, including changes to that report.

(2) Each construction permit holder described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall, by June 10, 1983, submit to the appropriate NRC Regional Office shown in appendix D of part 20 of this chapter the current description of the quality assurance program it is implementing for inclusion in the Safety Analysis Report, unless there are no changes to the description previously accepted by NRC. This submittal must identify changes made to the quality assurance program description since the description was submitted to NRC. (Should a permit holder need additional time beyond June 10, 1983 to submit its current quality assurance program description to NRC, it shall notify the appropriate NRC Regional Office in writing, explain why additional time is needed, and provide a schedule for NRC approval showing when its current quality assurance program description will be submitted.)

(3) After March 11, 1983, each construction permit holder described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section may make a change to a previously accepted quality assurance program description included or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report, provided the change does not reduce the commitments in the program description previously accepted by the NRC. Changes to the quality assurance program description that do not reduce the commitments must be submitted to NRC within 90 days. Changes to the quality assurance program description that do reduce the commitments must be submitted to NRC and receive NRC approval before implementation, as follows:

(i) Changes to the Safety Analysis Report must be submitted for review as specified in § 50.4. Changes made to NRC-accepted quality assurance topical report descriptions must be submitted as specified in § 50.4.

(ii) The submittal of a change to the Safety Analysis Report quality assurance program description must include all pages affected by that change and must be accompanied by a forwarding letter identifying the change, the reason for the change, and the basis for concluding that the revised program incorporating the change continues to satisfy the criteria of appendix B of this part and the Safety Analysis Report quality assurance program description commitments previously accepted by the NRC (the letter need not provide the basis for changes that correct spelling, punctuation, or editorial items).

(iii) A copy of the forwarding letter identifying the changes must be maintained as a facility record for three years.

(iv) Changes to the quality assurance program description included or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report shall be regarded as accepted by the Commission upon receipt of a letter to this effect from the appropriate reviewing office of the Commission or 60 days after submittal to the Commission, whichever occurs first.

(4) Each holder of an early site permit or a manufacturing license under part 52 of this chapter shall implement the quality assurance program described or referenced in the safety analysis report, including changes to that report. Each holder of a combined license shall implement the quality assurance program for design and construction described or referenced in the safety analysis report, including changes to that report, provided, however, that the holder of a combined license is not subject to the terms and conditions in this paragraph after the Commission makes the finding under § 52.103(g) of this chapter.

(i) Each holder described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section may make a change to a previously accepted quality assurance program description included or referenced in the safety analysis report, if the change does not reduce the commitments in the program description previously accepted by the NRC. Changes to the quality assurance program description that do not reduce the commitments must be submitted to NRC within 90 days. Changes to the quality assurance program description that reduce the commitments must be submitted to NRC and receive NRC approval before implementation, as follows:

(A) Changes to the safety analysis report must be submitted for review as specified in § 50.4. Changes made to NRC-accepted quality assurance topical report descriptions must be submitted as specified in § 50.4.

(B) The submittal of a change to the safety analysis report quality assurance program description must include all pages affected by that change and must be accompanied by a forwarding letter identifying the change, the reason for the change, and the basis for concluding that the revised program incorporating the change continues to satisfy the criteria of appendix B of this part and the safety analysis report quality assurance program description commitments previously accepted by the NRC (the letter need not provide the basis for changes that correct spelling, punctuation, or editorial items).

(C) A copy of the forwarding letter identifying the changes must be maintained as a facility record for three (3) years.

(D) Changes to the quality assurance program description included or referenced in the safety analysis report shall be regarded as accepted by the Commission upon receipt of a letter to this effect from the appropriate reviewing office of the Commission or 60 days after submittal to the Commission, whichever occurs first.
