###### Constant circulation airflow-control setting measurements.

8.6.2.The main burner or electric heating elements shall be turned off. The furnace fan controls shall be adjusted to the default constant circulation airflow-control setting. If the manufacturer does not specify a constant circulation airflow-control setting, the lowest airflow-control setting shall be used.

Measure furnace fan electrical input power (E) and external static pressure (ESP).
