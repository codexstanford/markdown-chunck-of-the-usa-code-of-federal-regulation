The SOMD's opinion must contain:

(i) The diagnosis of the worker's condition relevant to occupational exposure to beryllium, and any other medical condition that would place the worker at increased risk of material impairment to health from further exposure to beryllium;

(ii) Any recommendation for removal of the worker from DOE beryllium activities, or limitation on the worker's activities or duties or use of personal protective equipment, such as a respirator; and

(iii) A statement that the SOMD or examining physician has clearly explained to the worker the results of the medical evaluation, including all tests results and any medical condition related to beryllium exposure that requires further evaluation or treatment.

(2) The SOMD's written medical opinion must not reveal specific records, findings, and diagnoses that are not related to medical conditions that may be affected by beryllium exposure.
