###### Step 5:

Determine the energy efficiency ratio by dividing quantity from Step 4 by quantity from Step 3.

This ratio of fuel consumed to a unit measure of output will be used to develop a projection of a baseline and goals through 1990, and used in reporting variance. Examples of ratios that should be considered are:

Agencies shall select one or more of these ratios, which shall be used throughout the planning period, or use more appropriate energy efficiency ratios, to describe their overall functions. Figure B-4 illustrates the planning baseline and goal resulting from this type of analysis.

(c) For fuel switching-Fuel switching goals for gasoline other oil-based fuel and natural gas may be calculated as follows:
