####### Tested combination

means a multi-head mini-split, multi-split, or multi-circuit system having the following features:

(1) The system consists of one outdoor unit with one or more compressors matched with between two and five indoor units;

(2) The indoor units must:

(i) Collectively, have a nominal cooling capacity greater than or equal to 95 percent and less than or equal to 105 percent of the nominal cooling capacity of the outdoor unit;

(ii) Each represent the highest sales volume model family, if this is possible while meeting all the requirements of this section. If this is not possible, one or more of the indoor units may represent another indoor model family in order that all the other requirements of this section are met.

(iii) Individually not have a nominal cooling capacity greater than 50 percent of the nominal cooling capacity of the outdoor unit, unless the nominal cooling capacity of the outdoor unit is 24,000 Btu/h or less;

(iv) Operate at fan speeds consistent with manufacturer's specifications; and

(v) All be subject to the same minimum external static pressure requirement while able to produce the same external static pressure at the exit of each outlet plenum when connected in a manifold configuration as required by the test procedure.

(3) Where referenced, "nominal cooling capacity" means, for indoor units, the highest cooling capacity listed in published product literature for 95 &#xB0;F outdoor dry bulb temperature and 80 &#xB0;F dry bulb, 67 &#xB0;F wet bulb indoor conditions, and for outdoor units, the lowest cooling capacity listed in published product literature for these conditions. If incomplete or no operating conditions are published, the highest (for indoor units) or lowest (for outdoor units) such cooling capacity available for sale must be used.
