####### ยง 431.444 Test Procedures for the measurement of energy efficiency of small electric motors.
######## Polyphase small electric motors of less than or equal to 1 horsepower (0.75 kW).

(3)For polyphase small electric motors with 1 horsepower or less, use one of the following methods:

(i) IEEE 112-2017 Test Method A, Section 3, "General", Section 4, "Measurements", Section 5, "Machine losses and tests for losses", Section 6.1, "General", Section 6.3, "Efficiency test method A-Input-output", Section 9.2, "Form A-Method A", and Section 9.3, "Form A2-Method A calculations";

(ii) CSA C747-09, Section 1.6 "Scope", Section 3 "Definitions", Section 5, "General test requirements", and Section 6 "Test method";

(iii) IEC 60034-2-1:2014 Method 2-1-1A, Section 3 "Terms and definitions", Section 4 "Symbols and abbreviations", Section 5 "Basic requirements", and Section 6.1.2 "Method 2-1-1A-Direct measurement of input and output" (except Section 6.1.2.2, "Test Procedure"). The supply voltage shall be in accordance with section 7.2 of IEC 60034-1:2010. The measured resistance at the end of the thermal test shall be determined in a similar way to the extrapolation procedure described in section 8.6.2.3.3 of IEC 60034-1:2010 using the shortest possible time instead of the time interval specified in Table 5 therein, and extrapolating to zero. The measuring instruments for electrical quantities shall have the equivalent of an accuracy class of 0,2 in case of a direct test and 0,5 in case of an indirect test in accordance with section 5.2 of IEC 60051-1:2016.
