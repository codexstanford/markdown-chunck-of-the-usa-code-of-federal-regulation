####### Annual Operating Cost-Heating.

(2)Determine the represented value of estimated annual operating cost for air-source heat pumps that provide only heating or for the heating portion of the estimated annual operating cost for air-source heat pumps that provide both heating and cooling, as follows:

(i) When using appendix M to subpart B of part 430, the product of:

(A) The quotient of the mean of the standardized design heating requirement for the sample, in Btu's per hour, nearest to the Region IV minimum design heating requirement, determined for each unit in the sample in section 4.2 of appendix M to subpart B of part 430, divided by the represented value of heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF), in Btu's per watt-hour, calculated for Region IV corresponding to the above-mentioned standardized design heating requirement, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section;

(B) The representative average use cycle for heating of 2,080 hours per year;

(C) The adjustment factor of 0.77, which serves to adjust the calculated design heating requirement and heating load hours to the actual load experienced by a heating system;

(D) A conversion factor of 0.001 kilowatt per watt; and

(E) The representative average unit cost of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act;

(ii) When using appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430, the product of:

(A) The quotient of the represented value of cooling capacity (for air-source heat pumps that provide both cooling and heating) in Btu's per hour, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, or the represented value of heating capacity (for air-source heat pumps that provide only heating), as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(D) of this section, divided by the represented value of heating seasonal performance factor 2 (HSPF2), in Btu's per watt-hour, calculated for Region IV, as determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section;

(B) The representative average use cycle for heating of 1,572 hours per year;

(C) The adjustment factor of 1.15 (for heat pumps that are not variable-speed) or 1.07 (for heat pumps that are variable-speed), which serves to adjust the calculated design heating requirement and heating load hours to the actual load experienced by a heating system;

(D) A conversion factor of 0.001 kilowatt per watt; and

(E) The representative average unit cost of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided pursuant to section 323(b)(2) of the Act;
