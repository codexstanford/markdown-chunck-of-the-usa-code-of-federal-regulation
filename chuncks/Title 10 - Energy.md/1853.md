###### Review for opioids and prescription and over-the-counter medications.,i.e.,,i.e.

(j)(1) If the MRO determines that there is no legitimate medical explanation for a positive confirmatory test result for opioids (morphine and/or codeine) and before the MRO determines that the test result is a violation of the FFD policy, the MRO or his/her designee, who shall also be a licensed physician with knowledge of the clinical signs of drug abuse, shall determine that there is clinical evidence, in addition to the positive confirmatory test result, that the donor has illegally used morphine and/or codeine. This requirement does not apply if the laboratory confirms the presence of 6-AM (, the presence of this metabolite is proof of heroin use), or the morphine or codeine concentration is equal to or greater than 15,000 ng/mL and the donor does not present a legitimate medical explanation for the presence of morphine or codeine at or above this concentration. The MRO may not determine that the consumption of food products is a legitimate medical explanation for the presence of morphine or codeine at or above this concentration.

(2) If the MRO determines that there is no legitimate medical explanation for a positive confirmatory test result for drugs other than opioids that are commonly prescribed or included in over-the-counter preparations (e.g., benzodiazepines in the first case, barbiturates in the second) and are listed in the licensee's or other entity's panel of substances to be tested, the MRO shall determine whether there is clinical evidence, in addition to the positive confirmatory test result, of abuse of any of these substances or their derivatives.
