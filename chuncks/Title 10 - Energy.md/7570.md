####### Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.

(a)(1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to dehumidifiers; and

(2) For each basic model of dehumidifier selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that-

(i) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the energy factor, integrated energy factor, or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.90, where:

(3) The capacity of a basic model is the mean of the measured capacities for each tested unit of the basic model. Round the mean capacity value to two decimal places.

(4) For whole-home dehumidifiers, the case volume of a basic model is the mean of the measured case volumes for each tested unit of the basic model. Round the mean case volume value to one decimal place.

(5) Round the value of energy factor or integrated energy factor for a basic model to two decimal places.

(6) Dehumidifiers distributed in commerce by the manufacturer with the ability to operate as both a portable and whole-home dehumidifier by means of installation or removal of an optional ducting kit, must be rated and certified under both configurations.
