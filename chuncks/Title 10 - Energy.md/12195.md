####### Test Reference Year,

(viii) Weather Year for Energy Calculations (WYEC) weather year data (WYEC data are on tapes available from ASHRAE, 1791 Tullie Circle, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30329), or if unavailable, Test Reference Year (TRY) weather data (obtainable from National Climatic Data Center, 1983Tape Reference Manual, TD-9706, Asheville, North Carolina) relevant to project location.

(2) Estimating the discounted energy cost for the heating and cooling energy loads, respectively, according to the following equation-

(3) Estimating the discounted energy cost for water heating and refrigerator/freezer energy consumption-

(i) For equipment types covered by the COSTSAFR compliance forms, by multiplying the estimated unit energy cost by 100; or

(ii) For equipment types not covered by COSTSAFR-

(iii) [Reserved]

(4) Adding together the discounted energy costs calculated under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section;

(d) If the discounted energy cost of the proposed building design calculated under paragraph (c)(4) of this section is equal to or less than the discounted energy cost of the COSTSAFR prototype building design calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, then the proposed building design is in compliance with the applicable energy consumption goal under this part.
