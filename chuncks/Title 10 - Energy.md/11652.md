####### ยง 431.444 Test Procedures for the measurement of energy efficiency of small electric motors.
######## Single-phase small electric motors.

(2)For single-phase small electric motors, use one of the following methods:

(i) IEEE 114-2010, Section 3.2, "Test with load", Section 4, "Testing Facilities, Section 5, "Measurements", Section 6, "General", Section 7, "Type of loss", Section 8, "Efficiency and Power Factor"; Section 10 "Temperature Tests", Annex A, Section A.3 "Determination of Motor Efficiency", Annex A, Section A.4 "Explanatory notes for form 3, test data";

(ii) CSA C747-09, Section 1.6 "Scope", Section 3 "Definitions", Section 5, "General test requirements", and Section 6 "Test method";

(iii) IEC 60034-2-1:2014 Method 2-1-1A, Section 3 "Terms and definitions", Section 4 "Symbols and abbreviations", Section 5 "Basic requirements", and Section 6.1.2 "Method 2-1-1A-Direct measurement of input and output" (except Section 6.1.2.2, "Test Procedure"). The supply voltage shall be in accordance with section 7.2 of IEC 60034-1:2010 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.443). The measured resistance at the end of the thermal test shall be determined in a similar way to the extrapolation procedure described in section 8.6.2.3.3 of IEC 60034-1:2010, using the shortest possible time instead of the time interval specified in Table 5 therein, and extrapolating to zero. The measuring instruments for electrical quantities shall have the equivalent of an accuracy class of 0,2 in case of a direct test and 0,5 in case of an indirect test in accordance with section 5.2 of IEC 60051-1:2016 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.443).
