###### Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information,

(e) Written notification to the individual shall include, if the individual is a Federal employee, notification that if the individual believes that the action to suspend his/her access authorization was taken as retaliation against the individual for having made a protected disclosure, as defined in Presidential Policy Directive 19,or any successor directive issued under the authority of the President, the individual may submit a request for review of this matter directly to the DOE Office of the Inspector General. Such a request shall have no impact upon the continued processing of the individual's access authorization eligibility under this part.

(g) Upon receipt of the Manager's notification, the Director shall review the matter and confer with the Manager on:

(1) The institution of administrative review procedures set forth in §§ 710.20 through 710.30; or

(2) The reinstatement of access authorization; or

(3) Other actions as the Director deems appropriate.

(h) The Director shall act pursuant to one of these options within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Manager's notification unless an extension is granted by the Deputy Associate Under Secretary for Environment, Health, Safety and Security.
