###### ยง 429.26 Fluorescent lamp ballasts.
####### Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.

(a)(1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to fluorescent lamp ballasts; and

(2) For each basic model of fluorescent lamp ballasts, a sample of sufficient size, not less than four, shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that-

(i) Any represented value of the energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The upper 99 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.01, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the ballast luminous efficiency, power factor, or other measure of the energy efficiency or energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor a higher value must be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) The lower 99 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.99, where:

(iii) The represented value of average total lamp arc power must be equal to the mean of the sample,
