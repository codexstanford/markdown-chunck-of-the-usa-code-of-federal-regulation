###### Lamp Arc Current.

2.3.4.3.Position a current probe on each fluorescent lamp according to Figure 1 of this section for rapid- and programmed-start ballasts; Figure 2 of this section for instant-start ballasts operating SP lamps; and Figure 3 of this section for instant-start ballasts operating MBP, mini-BP, and RDC lamps.

For the lamp arc current measurement, set the full transducer ratio in the power analyzer to match the current probe to the power analyzer.

2.4.1. Establish and maintain test conditions for testing fluorescent lamp ballasts in accordance with sections 3 and 4 of ANSI C82.2.
