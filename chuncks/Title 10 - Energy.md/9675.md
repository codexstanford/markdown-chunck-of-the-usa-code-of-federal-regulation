####### Cool-down test for gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced-air central furnaces without stack dampers.

8.5Turn off the main burner after completing steady-state testing, and measure the flue gas temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 at 1.5 minutes (T(t)) and 9 minutes (T(t)) after shutting off the burner. When taking these temperature readings, the integral draft diverter must remain blocked and insulated, and the stack restriction must remain in place. On atmospheric systems with an integral draft diverter or draft hood and equipped with either an electromechanical inlet damper or an electromechanical flue damper that closes within 10 seconds after the burner shuts off to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger in the off-cycle, bypass or adjust the control for the electromechanical damper so that the damper remains open during the cool-down test.

For furnaces that employ post-purge, measure the length of the post-purge period with a stopwatch. Record the time from burner "OFF" to combustion blower "OFF" (electrically de-energized) as t. If the measured tis less than or equal to 30 seconds, set tat 0 and conduct the cool-down test as if there is no post-purge. If tis prescribed by the I&O manual or measured to be greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180 seconds and use that value for t. Measure the flue gas temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 at the end of the post-purge period, t(T(t)), and at the time (1.5 + t) minutes (T(t)) and (9.0 + t) minutes (T(t)) after the main burner shuts off.
