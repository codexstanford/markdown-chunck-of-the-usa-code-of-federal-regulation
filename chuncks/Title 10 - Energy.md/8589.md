(f) If the interior arrangements of the unit under test do not conform with those shown in Figures 5-1 or 5-2 of HRF-1-2019, as appropriate, the unit must be tested by relocating the temperature sensors from the locations specified in the figures to avoid interference with hardware or components within the unit, in which case the specific locations used for the temperature sensors shall be noted in the test data records maintained by the manufacturer in accordance with 10 CFR 429.71, and the certification report shall indicate that non-standard sensor locations were used. If any temperature sensor is relocated by any amount from the location prescribed in Figure 5-1 or 5-2 of HRF-1-2019 in order to maintain a minimum 1-inch air space from adjustable shelves or other components that could be relocated by the consumer, except in cases in which the Figures prescribe a temperature sensor location within 1 inch of a shelf or similar feature (sensor T3 in Figure 5-1), this constitutes a relocation of temperature sensors that must be recorded in the test data and reported in the certification report as described in this paragraph.

(a) Standard Approach

(i) For the purposes of comparing compartment temperatures with standardized temperatures, as described in section 5.6 of HRF-1-2019, the freezer compartment temperature shall be as specified in section 5.8.1.2.5 of HRF-1-2019, the fresh food compartment temperature shall be as specified in section 5.8.1.2.4 of HRF-1-2019, and the cooler compartment temperature shall be as specified in section 5.8.1.2.6 of HRF-1-2019.

(ii) In place of Table 5-1 in HRF-1-2019, refer to Table 1 of this section.

(b) Three-Point Interpolation Method (Optional Test for Models with Two Compartments and User-Operable Controls). As specified in section 5.6.3(6) of HRF-1-2019, and as an optional alternative to section 5.2(a) of this appendix, perform three tests such that the set of tests meets the "minimum requirements for interpolation" of AS/NZS 4474.1:2007 appendix M, section M3, paragraphs (a) through (c) and as illustrated in Figure M1. The target temperatures txA and txB defined in section M4(a)(i) of AS/NZ 4474.1:2007 shall be the standardized temperatures defined in section 5.6 of HRF-1-2019.
