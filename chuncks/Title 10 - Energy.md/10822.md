####### Water Temperatures.

3.2.3.Maintain the outlet temperature measured at Point C in Figure C9 at 180 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F and maintain the inlet temperature measured at Point B at 80 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F during the "Warm-up Period" and "Test Period" as indicated by 1-minute interval data pursuant to Table 3.2 of this appendix. Each reading must meet these temperature requirements. Field tests are exempt from this requirement and instead must comply with the requirements of section 3.2.3.1 of this appendix.

3.2.3.1. For field tests, the inlet temperature measured at Point A and Point B in Figure C9 and the outlet temperature measured and Point C in Figure C9 of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 must be recorded in the data underlying that model's certification pursuant to ยง 429.71 of this chapter, and the difference between the inlet (measured at Point B) and outlet temperature (measured at Point C) must not be less than 20 &#xB0;F at any point during the "Warm-up Period" and "Test Period," after stabilization has been achieved, as indicated by 1-minute interval data pursuant to Table 3.2 of this appendix.

3.2.3.2 For commercial packaged boilers that require a higher flow rate than that resulting from the water temperature requirements of sections 3.2.3 of this appendix to prevent boiling, use a recirculating loop and maintain the inlet temperature at Point B of Figure C9 of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 at 140 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F during the "Warm-up Period" and "Test Period" as indicated by 1-minute interval data pursuant to Table 3.2 of this appendix. Each reading must meet these temperature requirements.
