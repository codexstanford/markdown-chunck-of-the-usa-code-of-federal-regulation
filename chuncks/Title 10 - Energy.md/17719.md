###### SRT maintenance training.

(2)After assignment to duties as a member of an SRT, an SRT-qualified SPO must receive maintenance training annually on each area required by a site-specific JA or METL. The annual maintenance training program must be completed over two or more sessions appropriately spaced throughout the year. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SRT-qualified SPO being placed in a remedial training program or removal from SRT qualification status, as determined by contractor management. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SRT-qualified SPO with necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the JA or METL. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SRT-qualification status.
