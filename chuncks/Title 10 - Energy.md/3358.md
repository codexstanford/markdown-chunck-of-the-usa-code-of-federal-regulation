###### OM condition: Valve Position Indication.

(xi)When implementing paragraph ISTC-3700, "Position Verification Testing," in the ASME OM Code, 2012 Edition through the latest edition of the ASME OM Code incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, licensees must verify that valve operation is accurately indicated by supplementing valve position indicating lights with other indications, such as flow meters or other suitable instrumentation to provide assurance of proper obturator position for valves with remote position indication within the scope of Subsection ISTC including its mandatory appendices and their verification methods and frequencies. For valves not susceptible to stem-disk separation, licensees may implement ASME OM Code Case OMN-28, "Alternative Valve Position Verification Approach to Satisfy ISTC-3700 for Valves Not Susceptible to Stem-Disk Separation," which is incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(H) of this section. Where plant conditions make it impractical to perform the initial ISTC-3700 test as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section by the date 2 years following the previously performed ISTC-3700 test, a licensee may justify an extension of this initial supplemental valve position verification provided the ISTC-3700 test as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section is performed at the next available opportunity and no later than the next plant shutdown. This one-time extension of the ISTC-3700 test schedule as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section is acceptable provided the licensee has available for NRC review documented justification based on information obtained over the previous 5 years of the structural integrity of the stem-disk connection for the applicable valves. The licensee's justification could be based on, for example, verification of the valve stem-disk connection through an appropriate weak link analysis, appropriate disk motion confirmed during diagnostic testing, or allowance and cessation of flow through the valves. The licensee's justification must provide reasonable assurance that the remote indicating lights accurately reveal the position of the valve obturator until the next ISTC-3700 test as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section is performed.
