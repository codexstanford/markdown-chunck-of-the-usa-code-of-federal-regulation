(i) If oil-fired, the manufacturer (including brand, if applicable) and model number of the burner;

(ii) The rated input in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h);

(iii) The combustion efficiency in percent (%) to the nearest tenth of one percent or thermal efficiency in percent (%) to the nearest one tenth of one percent, as specified in § 431.87 of this chapter; and

(iv) For a basic model of commercial packaged boiler that cannot be tested using the standard inlet temperatures required in appendix A to subpart E of part 431, the average inlet water temperature measured at Point B in Figure C9 of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4) at which the model was tested.
