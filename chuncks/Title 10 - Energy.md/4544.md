###### Pyrophoric liquid

means any liquid that ignites spontaneously in dry or moist air at or below 130 &#xB0;F (54.5 &#xB0;C). A pyrophoric solid is any solid material, other than one classed as an explosive, which under normal conditions is liable to cause fires through friction, retained heat from manufacturing or processing, or which can be ignited readily and when ignited burns so vigorously and persistently as to create a serious transportation, handling, or disposal hazard. Included are spontaneously combustible and water-reactive materials.
