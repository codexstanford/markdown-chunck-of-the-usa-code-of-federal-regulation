##### Preoperational leakage rate tests.,Test pressure,Reduced pressure tests.

4.(a)-(1)(i) An initial test shall be performed at a pressure Pt, not less than 0.50 Pa to measure a leakage rate Ltm.

(ii) A second test shall be performed at pressure Pa to measure a leakage rate Lam.

(iii) The leakage characteristics yielded by measurements Ltm and Lam shall establish the maximum allowable test leakage rate Lt of not more than La (Ltm/Lam). In the event Ltm/Lam is greater than 0.7, Lt shall be specified as equal to La (Pt/Pa).
