#### ยง 1706.6 Solicitation provisions.
##### Advisory or assistance services.

(a)There shall be included in all formal Board solicitations for advisory or assistance services where the contract amount is expected to exceed $25,000 (or the then applicable small purchases threshold), a provision requiring a certificate representing whether award of the contract to the offeror would present actual or potential OCIs. Apparent successful offerors will be required to submit such certificates, but the Board may also require such a certificate to be submitted in other circumstances, such as:

(1) Where the contracting officer has identified certain offerors who have passed an initial screening and has determined that it is appropriate to request the identified offerors to file the certificate in order to expedite the award process; or

(2) In the case of modifications for additional effort under Board contracts, except those issued under the "changes" clause. If a certificate has been previously submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating of such statement shall be required for a contract modification.
