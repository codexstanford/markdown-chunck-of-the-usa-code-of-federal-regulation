####### 2.

2.2. If the water heater is not able to achieve an outlet water temperature of 70 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F (T) above the supply water temperature at full firing rate, a recirculating loop with pump as shown in Figure 2.4 of this appendix must be used.

2.2.2.1. If a recirculating loop with a pump is used, then ensure that the inlet water temperature labeled as Tin Figure 2.4 of this appendix, is greater than or equal to 70 &#xB0;F and less than or equal to 120 &#xB0;F at all times during the thermal efficiency test and steady-state verification period (as applicable).
