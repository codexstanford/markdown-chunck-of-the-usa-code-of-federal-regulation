8.9For units that have applied the test method in section 7.8 of this appendix to determine that no measurable airflow exists through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger during the burner off-period and having post-purge periods of less than 30 seconds, the cool-down and heat-up tests specified in sections 9.5 and 9.6 of ASHRAE 103-2017 may be omitted. In lieu of conducting the cool-down and heat-up tests, the tester may use the losses determined during the steady-state test described in section 9.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 when calculating heating seasonal efficiency, Effy.
