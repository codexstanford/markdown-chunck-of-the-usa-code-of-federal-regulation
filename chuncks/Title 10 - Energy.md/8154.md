####### i.e.,

(ii) If the value of nis less than or equal to zero and the mean energy or water consumption of the first sample (x) is greater than the upper control limit (UCL) or more than 105 percent of the applicable energy or water consumption standard (ECS), whichever is less,if n&#x2264;0 and x>min (UCL, 1.05 EPS), the basic model is not compliant and testing is at an end.

(iii) If the value of nis greater than zero, then the value of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the solution value of nfor equation (11). If the value of nso calculated is greater than 21-n, set nequal to 21-n.

(4) Compute the combined mean (x) of the measured energy or water consumption of the nand nunits of the combined first and second samples as follows:

(5) Compute the standard error (S) of the measured energy or water consumption of the nand nunits in the combined first and second samples as follows:

(6) For an energy or water consumption standard (ECS), compute the upper control limit (UCL) for the mean of the combined first and second samples using the DOE ECS as the desired mean and a one-tailed probability level of 97.5 percent (equivalent to the two-tailed probability level of 95 percent used in Step (f)(1)) as follows:

(7) For an energy or water consumption standard (ECS), compare the combined sample mean (x) to the upper control limit (UCL) to determine one of the following:
