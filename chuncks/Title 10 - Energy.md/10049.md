4.2.2

4.2.2.1 Season and stabilize lamps in accordance with Section (and corresponding subsections) 6.2 of IES LM-45-20 and with IES LM-54-20.

4.2.2.2 Measure the initial input power (in watts).

4.2.2.3 Measure initial lumen output in accordance with Section (and corresponding subsections) 7.0 of IES LM-45-20 and with IES LM-78-20.

4.2.2.4 Calculate initial lamp efficacy by dividing the measured initial lumen output by the measured initial input power.

4.2.2.5 Calculate CRI as specified in Section 7.4 of IES LM-45-20 and CIE 13.3. Conduct the required spectroradiometric measurement and characterization in accordance with the methods set forth in IES LM-58-20.

4.2.2.6 Calculate CCT as specified in Section 7.4 of IES LM-45-20 and CIE 15:2018. Conduct the required spectroradiometric measurement and characterization in accordance with the methods set forth in IES LM-58-20.
