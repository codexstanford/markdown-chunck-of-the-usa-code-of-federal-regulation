#### PART 431 - ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT
##### Subpart F - Commercial Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps
###### § 431.92 Definitions concerning commercial air conditioners and heat pumps.
####### Integrated energy efficiency ratio, or IEER,

means a weighted average calculation of mechanical cooling EERs determined for four load levels and corresponding rating conditions, expressed in Btu/watt-hour. IEER is measured per appendix A to this subpart for air-cooled small (≥65,000 Btu/h), large, and very large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, measured per appendix D1 to this subpart for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps (other than air-cooled with rated cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h), and measured per appendix G1 to this subpart for single package vertical air conditioners and single package vertical heat pumps.
