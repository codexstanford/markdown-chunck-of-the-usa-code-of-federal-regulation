###### Step 4c:

For four fixed sensor arms: Begin recording readings. Take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) and record this data. Take the readings for all sensor arms (Axes A, B, C, and D) simultaneously. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4c at the next highest speed until the low speed definition is met. Step 4c is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (100 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (100 readings).
