######## Ice hardness factor.

(ii)Determine the ice hardness factor according to the requirements in section A1 and A3 of Normative Annex A Method of Calorimetry in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the trials shall be conducted at an ambient air temperature (room temperature) of 70 &#xB0;F +/- 1 &#xB0;F, with an initial water temperature of 90 &#xB0;F +/- 1 &#xB0;F. The harvested ice used to determine the ice hardness factor shall be produced according to the test methods specified at ยง 431.134. The ice hardness factor shall be calculated using the equation for ice hardness factor in section 5.2.2 of AHRI Standard 810 (I-P)-2016 with Addendum 1.
