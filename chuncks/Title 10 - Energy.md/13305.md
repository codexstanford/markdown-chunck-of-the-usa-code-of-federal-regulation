###### § 600.25 Suspension and termination.
####### Termination by mutual agreement.

(d)In addition to any situation where a termination for cause pursuant to §§ 600.24, 600.160 through 600.162 §§ 600.243 through 600.244 or §§ 600.350 through 600.353 is appropriate, either DOE or the awardee may initiate a termination of an award (or portion thereof) as described in this paragraph. If the awardee initiates a termination, the awardee must notify DOE in writing and specify the awardee's reasons for requesting the termination, the proposed effective date of the termination, and, in the case of a partial termination, a description of the activities to be terminated, and an appropriate budget revision. DOE shall terminate an award or portion thereof under this paragraph only if both parties agree to the termination and the conditions under which it shall occur. If DOE determines that the remaining activities under a partially terminated award would not accomplish the purpose for which the award was originally awarded, DOE may terminate the entire award.
