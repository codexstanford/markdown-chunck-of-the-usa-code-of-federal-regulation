###### ยง 431.322 Definitions concerning metal halide lamp ballasts and fixtures.
####### Ballast efficiency

means, in the case of a high intensity discharge fixture, the efficiency of a lamp and ballast combination, expressed as a percentage, and calculated in accordance with the following formula: Efficiency = P/Pwhere:

(1) Pequals the measured operating lamp wattage; and

(2) Pequals the measured operating input wattage.

(3) The lamp, and the capacitor when the capacitor is provided, shall constitute a nominal system in accordance with the ANSI C78.43-2017 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 431.323);

(4) For ballasts with a frequency of 60 Hz, Pin and Pout shall be measured after lamps have been stabilized according to Section 4.4 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 431.323) using a wattmeter with accuracy specified in Section 4.5 of ANSI C82.6-2015; and

(5) For ballasts with a frequency greater than 60 Hz, Pin and Pout shall have a basic accuracy of +/-0.5 percent at the higher of either 3 times the output operating frequency of the ballast or 2.4 kHz.
