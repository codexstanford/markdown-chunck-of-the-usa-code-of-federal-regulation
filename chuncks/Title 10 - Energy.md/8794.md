####### Determination of Storage Tank Volume.

5.2.1For water heaters with a rated storage volume greater than or equal to 2 gallons, determine the storage capacity, V, of the water heater under test, in gallons (liters), by subtracting the tare weight-measured while the tank is empty-from the gross weight of the storage tank when completely filled with water (with all air eliminated and line pressure applied as described in section 2.5 of this appendix) and dividing the resulting net weight by the density of water at the measured temperature.
