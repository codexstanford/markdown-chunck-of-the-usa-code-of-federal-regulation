For coil-only split systems and blower coil split systems for which a furnace or a modular blower is the designated air mover, subtract the low-voltage power () from the shoulder season total off mode power (1) and divide by the number of compressors to calculatethe shoulder season per-compressor off mode power. Round to the nearest watt. The expression for calculatingis as follows:
