####### Clothes washers with cold rinse only.

3.8.2

3.8.2.1 Record the actual "bone dry" weight of the test load (WI), then place the test load in the clothes washer.

3.8.2.3 Run the Cold Wash/Cold Rinse cycle.

3.8.2.4 Record the weight of the test load immediately after completion of the wash cycle (WC).

3.8.2.5 Calculate the remaining moisture content of the maximum test load, RMC, defined as:

3.8.2.6 Apply the RMC correction curve described in section 9 of appendix J3 to this subpart to calculate the corrected remaining moisture content, RMC, expressed as a percentage as follows:

3.8.2.7 Use RMCas the final corrected RMC in section 4.3 of this appendix.
