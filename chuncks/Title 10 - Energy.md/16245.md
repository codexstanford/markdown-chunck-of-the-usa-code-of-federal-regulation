###### Favorable conditions.

(b)(1) Site conditions that permit the emplacement of waste at a depth of at least 300 meters below the directly overlying ground surface.

(2) A geologic setting where the nature and rates of the erosional processes that have been operating during the Quaternary Period are predicted to have less than one chance in 10,000 over the next 10,000 years of leading to releases of radionuclides to the accessible environment.

(3) Site conditions such that waste exhumation would not be expected to occur during the first one million years after repository closure.
