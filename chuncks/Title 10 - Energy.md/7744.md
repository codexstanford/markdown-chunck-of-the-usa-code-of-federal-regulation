####### Alternative efficiency determination methods.

(2)In lieu of testing, a represented value of efficiency or consumption for a basic model of commercial packaged boiler must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of ยง 429.70 and the provisions of this section, where:

(i) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the output of the AEDM and less than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model; and

(ii) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the output of the AEDM and greater than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model.

(3) The rated input for a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be the maximum rated input listed on the nameplate and in manufacturer literature for the commercial packaged boiler basic model. In the case where the nameplate and the manufacturer literature are not identical, DOE will use the nameplate on the unit for determining the rated input.

(4) For a model of commercial packaged boiler capable of supplying either steam or hot water, representative values for steam mode must be based on efficiency in steam mode and representative values for hot water mode must be based on either the efficiency in hot water mode or steam mode in accordance with the test procedure in ยง 431.86 of this chapter and the provisions of this section.
