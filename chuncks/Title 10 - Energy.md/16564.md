(2)The Secretary or the CEII Coordinator shall make a final determination whether to share CEII materials requested by non-federal entities that are within the categories specified in section 215A(d)(2)(D) of the FPA. A request by such a non-federal entity shall not be entertained unless the requesting non-federal entity demonstrates that the release of information is in the national security interest and it has entered into a Non-Disclosure Agreement with DOE that ensures, at a minimum:

(i) Use of the information only for authorized purposes and by authorized recipients and under the conditions prescribed by the Secretary or CEII Coordinator;

(ii) Protection of the information in a secure manner to prevent unauthorized access;

(iii) Destruction or return of the information after the intended purposes of receiving the information have been fulfilled;

(iv) Prevention of viewing or access by individuals or organizations that have been prohibited or restricted by the United States or the Department from viewing or accessing CEII;

(v) Compliance with the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, subject to DOE audit;

(vi) No further sharing of the information without DOE's permission; and

(vii) CEII provided pursuant to the agreement is not subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), and shall not be made available by any Federal, state, political subdivision, or tribal authority pursuant to any Federal, State, political subdivision, or tribal law requiring public disclosure of information or records pursuant to sections 215A(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Federal Power Act.

(viii) The Non-Disclosure Agreement must state that the agreement applies to all subsequent releases of CEII during the calendar year in which the DOE and the non-federal entity enter into the agreement. As a result, the non-federal entity will not be required to file a Non-Disclosure Agreement with subsequent requests during the calendar year.
