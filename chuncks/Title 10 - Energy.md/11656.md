######## Polyphase small electric motors of greater than 1 horsepower (0.75 kW).

(4)For polyphase small electric motors exceeding 1 horsepower, use one of the following methods:

(i) IEEE 112-2017 Test Method B, Section 3, "General"; Section 4, "Measurements"; Section 5, "Machine losses and tests for losses", Section 6.1, "General", Section 6.4, "Efficiency test method B-Input-output with loss segregation", Section 9.4, "Form B-Method B", and Section 9.5, "Form B2-Method B calculations"; or

(ii) CSA C390-10, Section 1.3, "Scope", Section 3.1, "Definitions", Section 5, "General test requirements-Measurements", Section 7, "Test method", Table 1, "Resistance measurement time delay, Annex B, "Linear regression analysis", and Annex C, "Procedure for correction of dynamometer torque readings"; or

(iii) IEC 60034-2-1:2014 Method 2-1-1B Section 3 "Terms and definitions", Section 4 "Symbols and abbreviations", Section 5 "Basic requirements", Section 6.1.3 "Method 2-1-1B-Summation of losses, additional load losses according to the method of residual losses.", and Annex D, "Test report template for 2-1-1B. The supply voltage shall be in accordance with section 7.2 of IEC 60034-1:2010. The measured resistance at the end of the thermal test shall be determined in a similar way to the extrapolation procedure described in section 8.6.2.3.3 of IEC 60034-1:2010 using the shortest possible time instead of the time interval specified in Table 5 therein, and extrapolating to zero. The measuring instruments for electrical quantities shall have the equivalent of an accuracy class of 0,2 in case of a direct test and 0,5 in case of an indirect test in accordance with section 5.2 of IEC 60051-1:2016.
