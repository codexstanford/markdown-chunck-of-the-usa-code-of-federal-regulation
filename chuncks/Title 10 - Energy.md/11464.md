###### ยง 431.302 Definitions concerning walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers.
####### Adaptive defrost,e.g.,

means a factory-installed defrost control system that reduces defrost frequency by initiating defrosts or adjusting the number of defrosts per day in response to operating conditions (moisture levels in the refrigerated space, measurements that represent coil frost load) rather than initiating defrost strictly based on compressor run time or clock time.
