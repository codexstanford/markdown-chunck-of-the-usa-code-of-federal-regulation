###### Appendix H to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Power Consumption of Television Sets
####### Power Meter Requirements.

3.3.The power measurement shall be carried out directly by means of a wattmeter, a wattmeter with averaging function, or a watt-hour meter by dividing the reading by the measuring time. For TVs where the input video signal varies over time, use a wattmeter with an averaging function to carry out the measurement.

3.3.1. The sampling rate of the watt-hour meter or wattmeter with averaging function shall be one measurement per second or more frequent.

3.3.2. The power measurement instrument shall measure and record the power factor and the real power consumed during all on mode tests at the same sampling rate.

3.3.3. Power measurements of 0.5 W or greater shall be made with an uncertainty of less than or equal to 2 percent (at the 95 percent confidence level). Measurements of power of less than 0.5 W shall be made with an uncertainty of less than or equal to 0.01 W (at the 95 percent confidence level). The power measurement instrument shall have a resolution of:

0.01 W or better for power measurements of 10 W or less;

0.1 W or better for power measurements of greater than 10 W up to 100 W;

1 W or better for power measurements of greater than 100 W.
