(3)The percent recovery of RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy due to the thermal annealing treatment must be determined based on the time and temperature of the actual vessel thermal anneal. The recovery of RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy provide the basis for establishing the post-anneal RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy for each vessel material. Changes in the RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy with subsequent plant operation must be determined using the post-anneal values of these parameters in conjunction with the projected reembrittlement trend determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Recovery and reembrittlement evaluations shall include:
