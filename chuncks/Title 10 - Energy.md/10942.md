####### Manufacturer involvement in assessment or enforcement testing for air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h.

6.A manufacturer's representative will be allowed to witness assessment and/or enforcement testing. The manufacturer's representative will be allowed to inspect and discuss set-up only with a DOE representative and adjust only the modulating components during testing in the presence of a DOE representative that are necessary to achieve steady-state operation. Only previously documented specifications for set-up as specified under sections 3 and 4 of this appendix will be used.
