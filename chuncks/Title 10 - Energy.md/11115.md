####### 3.,Ambient Room Temperature.

3.Maintain the ambient room temperature at 75 &#xB0;F +/- 10 &#xB0;F at all times during the steady-state verification period and the standby loss test. Measure the ambient room temperature at 1-minute intervals during these periods. Measure the ambient room temperature at the vertical mid-point of the water heater and approximately 2 feet from the water heater jacket or enclosure. Shield the sensor against radiation. Calculate the average ambient room temperature for the standby loss test. During the standby loss test, the ambient room temperature must not vary more than +/- 5.0 &#xB0;F at any reading from the average ambient room temperature.
