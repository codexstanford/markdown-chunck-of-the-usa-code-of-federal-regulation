2.2.3.Maintain the outlet temperature measured at Point C in Figure C9 of Appendix C of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 at 180 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F and maintain the inlet temperature measured at Point B at 80 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F during the "Warm-up Period" and "Test Period" as indicated by 1-minute interval data pursuant to Table 2.2 of this appendix. Each reading must meet these temperature requirements. Use the inlet temperature and flow rate measured at Point B in Figure C9 of Appendix C of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 for calculation of thermal efficiency.
