#### § 1003.16 Dismissal of petitions.
##### Dismissal without prejudice.

(b)The dismissal of a petition without prejudice by the OHA terminates the OHA's review of the petition but does not bar the petitioner from resubmitting the petition provided that the facts or circumstances leading to the dismissal have been resolved. In dismissing a petition without prejudice, the OHA may order that the petitioner may not resubmit the petition, or a substantially similar petition, for a period of time not to exceed 180 days. The OHA may dismiss a petition without prejudice if:

(1) The petitioner fails to include any of the required elements of a petition set forth in § 1003.11 of this part;

(2) The petitioner fails to provide notice as required by § 1003.12 of this part;

(3) The petitioner fails to timely provide documents or information at the request of the OHA pursuant to § 1003.14 or § 1003.15 of this part;

(4) The petition fails to state a claim upon which the OHA can grant relief; or

(5) The OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision.
