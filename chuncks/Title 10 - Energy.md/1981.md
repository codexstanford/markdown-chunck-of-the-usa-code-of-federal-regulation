## Chapter I - Nuclear Regulatory Commission
### PART 30 - RULES OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO DOMESTIC LICENSING OF BYPRODUCT MATERIAL
#### Licenses
##### § 30.32 Application for specific licenses.

(a) A person may file an application on NRC Form 313, "Application for Material License," in accordance with the instructions in § 30.6 of this chapter. Information contained in previous applications, statements or reports filed with the Commission or the Atomic Energy Commission may be incorporated by reference, provided that the reference is clear and specific.

(b) The Commission may at any time after the filing of the original application, and before the expiration of the license, require further statements in order to enable the Commission to determine whether the application should be granted or denied or whether a license should be modified or revoked.

(c) Each application shall be signed by the applicant or licensee or a person duly authorized to act for and on his behalf.

(d) An application for license filed pursuant to the regulations in this part and parts 32 through 35 of this chapter will be considered also as an application for licenses authorizing other activities for which licenses are required by the Act, provided that the application specifies the additional activities for which licenses are requested and complies with regulations of the Commission as to applications for such licenses.

(e) Each application for a byproduct material license, other than a license exempted from part 170 of this chapter, shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed in § 170.31 of this chapter. No fee will be required to accompany an application for renewal or amendment of a license, except as provided in § 170.31 of this chapter.

(f) An application for a license to receive and possess byproduct material for the conduct of any activity which the Commission has determined pursuant to subpart A of part 51 of this chapter will significantly affect the quality of the environment shall be filed at least 9 months prior to commencement of construction of the plant or facility in which the activity will be conducted and shall be accompanied by any Environmental Report required pursuant to subpart A of part 51 of this chapter.

(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, an application for a specific license to use byproduct material in the form of a sealed source or in a device that contains the sealed source must either-

(i) Identify the source or device by manufacturer and model number as registered with the Commission under § 32.210 of this chapter, with an Agreement State, or for a source or a device containing radium-226 or accelerator-produced radioactive material with a State under provisions comparable to § 32.210 of this chapter; or

(ii) Contain the information identified in § 32.210(c) of this chapter.

(2) For sources or devices manufactured before October 23, 2012 that are not registered with the Commission under § 32.210 of this chapter or with an Agreement State, and for which the applicant is unable to provide all categories of information specified in § 32.210(c) of this chapter, the application must include:

(i) All available information identified in § 32.210(c) of this chapter concerning the source, and, if applicable, the device; and

(ii) Sufficient additional information to demonstrate that there is reasonable assurance that the radiation safety properties of the source or device are adequate to protect health and minimize danger to life and property. Such information must include a description of the source or device, a description of radiation safety features, the intended use and associated operating experience, and the results of a recent leak test.

(3) For sealed sources and devices allowed to be distributed without registration of safety information in accordance with § 32.210(g)(1) of this chapter, the applicant may supply only the manufacturer, model number, and radionuclide and quantity.

(4) If it is not feasible to identify each sealed source and device individually, the applicant may propose constraints on the number and type of sealed sources and devices to be used and the conditions under which they will be used, in lieu of identifying each sealed source and device.

(h) As provided by § 30.35, certain applications for specific licenses filed under this part and parts 32 through 35 of this chapter must contain a proposed decommissioning funding plan or a certification of financial assurance for decommissioning. In the case of renewal applications submitted before July 27, 1990, this submittal may follow the renewal application but must be submitted on or before July 27, 1990.

(i)(1) Each application to possess radioactive materials in unsealed form, on foils or plated sources, or sealed in glass in excess of the quantities in § 30.72, "Schedule C-Quantities of Radioactive Materials Requiring Consideration of the Need for an Emergency Plan for Responding to a Release," must contain either:

(i) An evaluation showing that the maximum dose to a person offsite due to a release of radioactive materials would not exceed 1 rem effective dose equivalent or 5 rems to the thyroid; or

(ii) An emergency plan for responding to a release of radioactive material.

(2) One or more of the following factors may be used to support an evaluation submitted under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section:

(i) The radioactive material is physically separated so that only a portion could be involved in an accident;

(ii) All or part of the radioactive material is not subject to release during an accident because of the way it is stored or packaged;

(iii) The release fraction in the respirable size range would be lower than the release fraction shown § 30.72 due to the chemical or physical form of the material;

(iv) The solubility of the radioactive material would reduce the dose received;

(v) Facility design or engineered safety features in the facility would cause the release fraction to be lower than shown in § 30.72;

(vi) Operating restrictions or procedures would prevent a release fraction as large as that shown in § 30.72; or

(vii) Other factors appropriate for the specific facility.

(3) An emergency plan for responding to a release of radioactive material submitted under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section must include the following information:
