####### Energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures

means modifications in the maintenance and operations of a building and any installation therein which are designed to reduce the energy consumption in such building and which require no significant expenditure of funds, including, but not limited to:

(1) Effective operation and maintenance of ventilation systems and control of infiltration conditions, including:

(i) Repair of caulking or weatherstripping around windows and doors;

(ii) Reduction of outside air intake, shutting down ventilation systems in unoccupied areas, and shutting down ventilation systems when the building is not occupied; and

(iii) Assuring central or unitary ventilation controls, or both, are operating properly;

(2) Changes in the operation and maintenance of heating or cooling systems through:

(i) Lowering or raising indoor temperatures;

(ii) Locking thermostats;

(iii) Adjusting supply or heat transfer medium temperatures; and

(iv) Reducing or eliminating heating or cooling at night or at times when a building or complex is unoccupied;

(3) Changes in the operation and maintenance of lighting systems through:

(i) Reducing illumination levels;

(ii) Maximizing use of daylight;

(iii) Using higher efficiency lamps; and

(iv) Reducing or eliminating evening cleaning of buildings;

(4) Changes in the operation and maintenance of water systems through:

(i) Repairing leaks;

(ii) Reducing the quantity of water used, e.g., using flow restrictors;

(iii) Lowering settings for hot water temperatures; and

(iv) Raising settings for chilled water temperatures;

(5) Changes in the maintenance and operating procedures of the building's mechanical systems through:

(i) Cleaning equipment;

(ii) Adjusting air/fuel ratio;

(iii) Monitoring combustion;

(iv) Adjusting fan, motor, or belt drive systems;

(v) Maintaining steam traps; and

(vi) Repairing distribution pipe insulation; and

(6) Such other actions relating to operations and maintenance procedures as the State may determine useful or necessary. In general, energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures involve cleaning, repairing or adjusting existing equipment rather than acquiring new equipment.
