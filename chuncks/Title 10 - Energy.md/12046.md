####### Compliance Testing.

402.2.2.4All buildings shall be tested after completion using the methodology in RS-11, (incorporated by reference, see ยง 434.701) or an equivalent approved method to determine the envelope air leakage. A standard blower door test is an acceptable technique to pressurize the building if the building is 5,000 ftor less in area. The building's air handling system can be used to pressurize the building if the building is larger than 5,000 ft. The following test conditions shall be:

(a) The measured envelope air leakage shall not exceed 1.57 pounds per square foot of wall area at a pressure difference of 0.3 inches water.

(b) At the time of testing, all windows and outside doors shall be installed and closed, all interior doors shall be open, and all air handlers and dampers shall be operable. The building shall be unoccupied.

(c) During the testing period, the average wind speed during the test shall be less than 6.6 feet per second, the average outside temperature greater than 59 &#xB0;F, and the average inside-outside temperature difference is less than 41 &#xB0;F.
