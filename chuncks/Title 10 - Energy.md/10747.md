######## Oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces.

(2)You must calculate the percent flue loss (in percent of heat input rate) by following the procedure specified in sections 11.1.4, 11.1.5, and 11.1.6.2 of the HI BTS-2000 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.75). The thermal efficiency must be calculated as: Thermal Efficiency (percent) = 100 percent - flue loss (in percent).
