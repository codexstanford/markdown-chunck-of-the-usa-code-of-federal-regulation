###### Furnace fans for which the maximum airflow-control setting is not a default heating airflow-control setting.

8.6.1.1.The main burner or electric heating elements shall be turned off. Adjust the external static pressure to within the range shown in Table 1 by symmetrically restricting the outlet of the test duct. Maintain these settings until steady-state conditions are attained as specified in section 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 of this appendix. Measure furnace fan electrical input power (E), external static pressure (ESP), and outlet air temperature (T).
