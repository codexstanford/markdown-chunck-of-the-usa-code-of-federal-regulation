####### Control Settings.

5.1Control settings must be set in accordance with Sections 5.1.3, 5.1.4, 5.1.5, and 5.2 of AHRI 1230-2021. For systems equipped with head pressure controls, the head pressure controls must be set per manufacturer installation instructions or per factory settings if no instructions are provided. Indoor airflow-control settings must be set in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of AHRI 1230-2021. At each load point, critical parameters must be set to the values certified in the supplemental testing instructions (STI) provided by the manufacturer pursuant to ยง 429.43(b)(4) of this chapter. In cases in which a certified critical parameter value is not in the STI, the system must operate per commands from the system controls for that parameter. Once set, control settings must remain unchanged for the remainder of the test (except for allowable adjustment of critical parameters as described in section 5.2 of this appendix).
