###### i.e.,

(6) A minimum of 10 percent of the total specimens in each analytical run of specimens to be initially tested for drugs and drug metabolites by the licensee testing facility must be quality control samples (calibrators and controls), which the licensee testing facility shall use for internal quality control purposes. (These samples are not forwarded to the HHS-certified laboratory for further testing, other than for performance testing of the samples.) Licensee testing facilities shall ensure that quality control samples that are positive for each drug and drug metabolite for which the FFD program conducts testing are included in at least one analytical run each calendar quarter. The quality control samples for each analytical run must include-

(i) At least one control certified by an HHS-certified laboratory to contain no drug or drug metabolite;

(ii) At least one positive control with the drug or drug metabolite targeted at 25 percent above the cutoff;

(iii) At least one positive control with the drug or drug metabolite targeted at 75 percent of the cutoff;

(iv) A sufficient number of calibrators to ensure and document the linearity of the assay method over time in the concentration area of the cutoff (after acceptable values are obtained for the known calibrators, those values will be used to calculate sample data); and

(7) Licensee testing facilities shall document the implementation of procedures to ensure that carryover does not contaminate the testing of a donor's specimen.
