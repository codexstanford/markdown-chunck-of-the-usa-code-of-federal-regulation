##### § 73.67 Licensee fixed site and in-transit requirements for the physical protection of special nuclear material of moderate and low strategic significance.
###### In-transit requirements for special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance.

(e)(1) Each licensee who transports, exports or delivers to a carrier for transport special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance shall:

(i) Provide advance notification to the receiver of any planned shipments specifying the mode of transport, estimated time of arrival, location of the nuclear material transfer point, name of carrier and transport identification,

(ii) Receive confirmation from the receiver prior to the commencement of the planned shipment that the receiver will be ready to accept the shipment at the planned time and location and acknowledges the specified mode of transport,

(iii) Check the integrity of the container and locks or seals prior to shipment, and

(iv) Arrange for the in-transit physical protection of the materials in accordance with the requirements of § 73.67(e)(3) unless the receiver is a licensee and has agreed in writing to arrange for the in-transit physical protection.

(2) Each licensee who receives special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance shall:

(i) Check the integrity of the containers and seals upon receipt of the shipment,

(ii) Notify the shipper of receipt of the material as required in § 74.15 of this chapter, and

(iii) Arrange for the in-transit physical protection of the material in accordance with the requirements of § 73.67(e)(3) unless the shipper is a licensee and has agreed in writing to arrange for the in-transit physical protection.

(3) Each licensee who arranges for the in-transit physical protection of special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance, or who takes delivery of this material free on board (f.o.b.) the point at which it is delivered to a carrier for transport shall:

(i) Arrange for telephone or radio communications between the transport and the licensee or its designee: (A) To periodically confirm the status of the shipment (B) for notification of any delays in the scheduled shipment, and (C) to request appropriate local law enforcement agency response in the event of an emergency.

(ii) Minimize the time that the material is in transit by reducing the number and duration of nuclear material transfers and by routing the material in the most safe and direct manner,

(iii) Conduct screening of all licensee employees involved in the transportation of the material in order to obtain information on which to base a decision to permit them control over the material,

(iv) Establish and maintain written response procedures for dealing with threats of thefts or thefts of this material. The licensee shall retain a copy of the current response procedures as a record for three years after the close of period for which the licensee possesses the special nuclear material under each license for which the original procedures were developed and copies of superseded material must be retained for three years after each change.

(v) Make arrangements to be notified immediately of the arrival of the shipment at its destination, or of any such shipment that is lost or unaccounted for after the estimated time of arrival at its destination, and

(vi) Initiate immediately a trace investigation of any shipment that is determined to be lost or unaccounted for after a reasonable time beyond the estimated arrival time.

(4) Each licensee who arranges the physical protection of strategic special nuclear material in quantities of moderate strategic significance while in transit or who takes delivery of this material free on board (f.o.b.) the point at which it is delivered to a carrier for transport shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e) (1), (2), and (3) of this section. The licensee shall retain each record required by paragraphs (e) (1), (2), (3), and (4) (i) and (ii) of this section for three years after close of period licensee possesses special nuclear material under each license that authorizes these licensee activities. Copies of superseded material must be retained for three years after each change. In addition, the licensee shall-

(i) Make all shipments of the material either (A) in dedicated transports with no intermediate stops to load or unload other cargo and with no carrier or vehicle transfers or temporary storage in-transit, or (B) under arrangements whereby the custody of the shipment and all custody transfers are acknowledged by signature, and

(ii) Maintain the material under lock or under the control of an individual who has acknowledged acceptance of custody of the material by signature.

(5) Each licensee who exports special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c) and (e) (1), (3), and (4) of this section. The licensee shall retain each record required by these sections for three years after the close of period for which the licensee possesses the special nuclear material under each license that authorizes the licensee to export this material. Copies of superseded material must be retained for three years after each change.

(6) Each licensee who imports special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance shall,

(i) Comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c) and (e) (2), (3), and (4) of this section. The licensee shall retain each record required by these sections for three years after the close of period for which the licensee possesses the special nuclear material under each license that authorizes the licensee to import this material. Copies of superseded material must be retained for three years after each change.

(ii) Notify the exporter who delivered the material to a carrier for transport of the arrival of such material.

(7) If, after receiving advance notice pursuant to § 73.72 from a licensee planning to import, export, transport, deliver to a carrier for transport in a single shipment, or take delivery at the point where it is delivered to a carrier, special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance containing in any part strategic special nuclear material, it appears to the Commission that two or more shipments of special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance, constituting in the aggregate an amount equal to or greater than a formula quantity of strategic special nuclear material, may be en route at the same time, the Commission may order one or more of the shippers to delay shipment according to the following provisions:

(i) The shipper shall provide to the Commission, upon request, such additional information regarding a planned shipment as the Commission considers pertinent to the decision on whether to delay such shipment.

(ii) The receiver of each shipment, or the shipper if the receiver is not a licensee, shall notify the Director, Division of Physical and Cyber Security Policy, Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, by telephone, no later than 24 hours after arrival of such shipment at its final destination, or after such shipment has left the United States as an export, to confirm the integrity of the shipment at the time of receipt or exit from the United States.

(iii) The Commission shall notify the affected shippers no later than two days before the scheduled shipment date that a given shipment is to be delayed.

(iv) Shipments of special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance which are protected in accordance with the provisions of §§ 73.20, 73.25, and 73.26 shall not be subject to orders to delay shipment nor considered to constitute a portion of an aggregate formula quantity of strategic special nuclear material for the purposes of determining whether any shipments must delayed.
