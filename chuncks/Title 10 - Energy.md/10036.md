###### Time to failure

2.5means the time elapsed between first use and the point at which the lamp ceases to produce measurable lumen output.

3.1 When there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over any materials incorporated by reference.

3.2 Maintain lamp operating orientation throughout seasoning and testing, except that for T5 miniature bipin standard and high output GSFLs, follow Section 6.2.2 of IES LM-9-20. For all GSFLs, maintain lamp orientation when transferring lamps from a warm-up position to the photometric equipment per Section 6.2.4 of IES LM-9-20. Maintain lamp orientation at all other times, if practical.

3.3 If a lamp breaks, becomes defective, fails to stabilize, exhibits abnormal behavior (such as swirling), or stops producing light prior to the end of the seasoning period, replace the lamp with a new unit. However, if a lamp exhibits one of the conditions listed in the previous sentence only after the seasoning period ends, include the lamp's measurements in the sample.

3.4 Operate GSILs and IRLs at the rated voltage for incandescent lamps as defined in 10 CFR 430.2.
