###### T12 lamps:

(a)400 volts, 0.800 amps, and 415 ohms, at low frequency (60 Hz) and with cathode power. Approximate cathode wattage (with 3.6 V on each cathode): 7.0 W. Cathode characteristics for low resistance (at 3.6 V): 3.2 ohms (objective); 2.5 ohms (minimum). Cathode heat requirements for rapid start: 3.6 V (nominal); 3.0 V min, 4.0 V max (limits during operation); 3.2 ohms +/-0.05 ohm (dummy load resistor); 3.4 V min, 4.5 V max (voltage across dummy load).
