###### 2.6.1.3 Draft hood or direct vent system which does not intentionally preheat incoming air.

For units which employ a draft hood or units which employ a direct vent system which does not intentionally preheat the incoming combustion air, such as a non-concentric direct vent system, install nine thermocouples, wired in parallel, in a horizontal plane located within 12 inches (304.8 mm) of the heater outlet and upstream of the draft hood on units so equipped. Locate one thermocouple in the center of the pipe and eight thermocouples along imaginary lines intersecting at right angles in this horizontal plane at points one third and two thirds of the distance between the center of the pipe and the pipe wall.

For units with a flue pipe diameter of 2 inches or less, five thermocouples may be installed instead of nine. Locate one thermocouple in the center of the pipe and four thermocouples along imaginary lines intersecting at right angles in this horizontal plane at points halfway between the center of the pipe and the pipe wall.
