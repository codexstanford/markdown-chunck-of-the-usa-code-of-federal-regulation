####### Criteria for exemption from preemption.

(a)Upon petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary shall prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he/she determines that the State has established by a preponderance of evidence that such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy interests. For the purposes of this regulation, the term "unusual and compelling State or local energy interests" means interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude from those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings resulting from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy savings or production, including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on a national basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors including: The extent to which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered equipment in the State; the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered equipment type (or class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction in the current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within the U.S., or in the current or projected sales volume of the covered equipment type (or class) in the State and the U.S.; and the extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State commercial and industrial equipment efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he/she finds that such a rule will result in the unavailability in the State of any covered equipment (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).

(1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption. A petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence relating to such petition shall be available for public review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004.

(i) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;

(ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such standard is sought;

(iii) A copy of the State's energy plan and forecast;

(iv) Specification of each type or class of covered equipment for which a rule exempting a standard is sought;

(v) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the petitioner; and

(vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
