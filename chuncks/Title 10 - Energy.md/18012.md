#### ยง 1706.8 Waiver.
##### Criteria for Waiver of OCIs.

(b)(1) The Chairman is authorized to waive any OCI (and the corresponding provision of ยง 1706.5 where applicable) upon a determination that awarding or extending the particular contract, or not terminating the particular contract, would be in the best interests of the Government. Issuance of a waiver shall ordinarily be limited to those situations in which:

(i) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the Board program;

(ii) The work cannot be satisfactorily performed except by a contractor or offeror whose interests give rise to a question of OCI; and

(iii) Contractual and/or technical review and supervision methods can be employed by the Board to mitigate the conflict.

(2) The Chairman is also authorized to waive any OCI (and the corresponding provision of ยง 1706.5 where applicable), without regard to the foregoing factors, if the Chairman determines, notwithstanding the existence of the OCI, that it is in best interests of the Government to award or extend the particular contract, or not to terminate it, without compliance with ยง 1706.8(b)(1).
