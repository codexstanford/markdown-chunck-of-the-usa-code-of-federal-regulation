3.2.5.For condensing boilers (except during field tests), maintain ambient room relative humidity below 80-percent relative humidity at all times during both the "Warm-up Period" and "Test Period" (as described in Section C4 of Appendix C of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015) pursuant to Table 3.2 of this appendix. Measure the ambient humidity in the same location as ambient air temperature. For field tests of condensing boilers, record the ambient room relative humidity in accordance with Table 3.2 of this appendix.
