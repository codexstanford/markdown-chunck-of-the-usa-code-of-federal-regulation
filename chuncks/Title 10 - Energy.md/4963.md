#### Subpart E - Licenses
##### ยง 70.39 Specific licenses for the manufacture or initial transfer of calibration or reference sources.

(a) An application for a specific license to manufacture or initially transfer calibration or reference sources containing plutonium, for distribution to persons generally licensed under ยง 70.19, will be approved if:

(1) The applicant satisfies the general requirements of ยง 70.23.

(2) The applicant submits sufficient information regarding each type of calibration or reference source pertinent to evaluation of the potential radiation exposure, including:

(i) Chemical and physical form and maximum quantity of plutonium in the source;

(ii) Details of construction and design;

(iii) Details of the method of incorporation and binding of the plutonium in the source;

(iv) Procedures for and results of prototype testing of sources, which are designed to contain more than 0.005 microcurie of plutonium, to demonstrate that the plutonium contained in each source will not be released or be removed from the source under normal conditions of use;

(v) Details of quality control procedures to be followed in manufacture of the source;

(vi) Description of labeling to be affixed to the source or the storage container for the source;

(vii) Any additional information, including experimental studies and tests, required by the Commission to facilitate a determination of the safety of the source.

(3) Each source will contain no more than 5 microcuries of plutonium.

(4) The Commission determines, with respect to any type of source containing more than 0.005 microcurie of plutonium, that:

(i) The method of incorporation and binding of the plutonium in the source is such that the plutonium will not be released or be removed from the source under normal conditions of use and handling of the source; and

(ii) The source has been subjected to and has satisfactorily passed the prototype tests prescribed by paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(5) For any type of source which is designed to contain more than 0.005 microcurie of plutonium, the applicant has conducted prototype tests, in the order listed, on each of five prototypes of such source, which contains more than 0.005 microcurie of plutonium, as follows:
