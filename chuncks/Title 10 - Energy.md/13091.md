###### ยง 503.8 No alternate power supply - general requirement for certain exemptions for new powerplants.
####### Application.

(a)To qualify for an exemption, except in the case of an exemption for cogeneration units, section 213(c) of the Act requires a demonstration that, despite reasonable good faith efforts, there is no alternative supply of electric power available within a reasonable distance at a reasonable cost without impairing short-run or long-run reliability of service. If a petitioner is unable to demonstrate that there is no alternate supply during the first year of operation, OFE will conclude that the absence of the proposed powerplant will not impair short-term reliability of service, and as a result will not grant the exemption. Such action would not impair long-term reliability of service, since a petition may be submitted for a powerplant that would begin operation in a subsequent year.
