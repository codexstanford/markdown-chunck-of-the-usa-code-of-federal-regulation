### PART 50 - DOMESTIC LICENSING OF PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION FACILITIES
#### Issuance, Limitations, and Conditions of Licenses and Construction Permits
##### § 50.55 Conditions of construction permits, early site permits, combined licenses, and manufacturing licenses.

Each construction permit for a utilization facility is subject to the following terms and conditions and the applicable requirements of § 50.55a; each construction permit for a production facility is subject to the following terms and conditions with the exception of paragraph (i); each early site permit is subject to the terms and conditions in paragraph (f) of this section; each manufacturing license is subject to the terms and conditions in paragraphs (e), (f), and (i) of this section and the applicable requirements of § 50.55a; and each combined license is subject to the terms and conditions in paragraphs (e), (f), and (i) of this section and the applicable requirements of § 50.55a until the date that the Commission makes the finding under § 52.103(g) of this chapter:

(a) The construction permit shall state the earliest and latest dates for completion of the construction or modification.

(b) If the proposed construction or modification of the facility is not completed by the latest completion date, the construction permit shall expire and all rights are forfeited. However, upon good cause shown, the Commission will extend the completion date for a reasonable period of time. The Commission will recognize, among other things, developmental problems attributable to the experimental nature of the facility or fire, flood, explosion, strike, sabotage, domestic violence, enemy action, an act of the elements, and other acts beyond the control of the permit holder, as a basis for extending the completion date.

(c) Except as modified by this section and § 50.55a, the construction permit shall be subject to the same conditions to which a license is subject.

(d) At or about the time of completion of the construction or modification of the facility, the applicant will file any additional information needed to bring the original application for license up to date, and will file an application for an operating license or an amendment to an application for a license to construct and operate the facility for the issuance of an operating license, as appropriate, as specified in § 50.30(d) of this part.
