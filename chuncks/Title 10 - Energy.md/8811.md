Initiate a second and, if applicable, successive draw(s) each time the applicable draw initiation criteria described in section 5.3.3.2 are satisfied. As required for the first draw, record the outlet water temperature 15 seconds after initiating each draw and at 5-second intervals thereafter until the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum outlet temperature that occurs during each draw and record it as T*, where the subscript i refers to the draw number. Terminate each hot water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to T*- 15 &#xB0;F (T*- 8.3 &#xB0;C). Record this temperature as T*. Calculate and record the average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed during each draw (*and M*or V*, respectively). Continue this sequence of draw and recovery until one hour after the start of the test, then shut off the electrical power and/or fuel supplied to the water heater.
