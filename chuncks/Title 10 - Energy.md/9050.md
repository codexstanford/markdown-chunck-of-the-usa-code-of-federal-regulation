####### Product temperature stability.

2.5.1Prior to any testing, the product must achieve a stable temperature meeting the ambient room air temperature specified in section 2.4 of this appendix. For all conventional cooking tops, forced cooling may be used to assist in reducing the temperature of the product between tests, as specified in Section 5.5 of IEC 60350-2. Forced cooling must not be used during the period of time used to assess temperature stability.
