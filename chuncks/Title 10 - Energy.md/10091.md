###### Step 4a:

For a rotating sensor arm: Begin recording readings. Starting with Axis A, take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) and record these data. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4a at the next highest speed until the low-speed definition is met. Once the low speed definition is met, rotate the arm, stabilize the arm, and allow 30 seconds to allow the arm to stop oscillating. Repeat data recording and rotation process for Axes B, C, and D. Step 4a is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (400 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (400 readings).
