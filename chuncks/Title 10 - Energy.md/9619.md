(T) = BL(T), the space heating capacity delivered by the unit in matching the building load at temperature (T), in Btu/h. The matching occurs with the heat pump operating at compressor speed k=i, and

COP(T) = the steady-state coefficient of performance of the heat pump when operating at compressor speed k=i and temperature T(dimensionless). For each temperature bin where the heat pump operates at an intermediate compressor speed, determine COP(T) using the following equations,
