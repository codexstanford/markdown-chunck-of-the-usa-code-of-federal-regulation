##### ยง 2.909 Rearrangement or suspension of proceedings.

In any proceeding subject to this part where a party gives a notice of intent to introduce Restricted Data or other National Security Information, and the presiding officer determines that any other interested party does not have required security clearances, the presiding officer may in his discretion:

(a) Rearrange the normal order of the proceeding in a manner which gives such interested parties an opportunity to obtain required security clearances with minimum delay in the conduct of the proceeding.

(b) Suspend the proceeding or any portion of it until all interested parties have had opportunity to obtain required security clearances. No proceeding shall be suspended for such reasons for more than 100 days except with the consent of all parties or on a determination by the presiding officer that further suspension of the proceeding would not be contrary to the public interest.

(c) Take such other action as he determines to be in the best interest of all parties and the public.
