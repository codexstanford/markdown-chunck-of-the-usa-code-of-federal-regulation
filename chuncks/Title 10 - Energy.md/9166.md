###### Appendix J to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Automatic and Semi-Automatic Clothes Washers
####### Per-cycle temperature-weighted hot water consumption for all load sizes tested.

4.1.1Calculate the per-cycle temperature-weighted hot water consumption for the large test load size, Vhand the small test load size, Vh, expressed in gallons per cycle (or liters per cycle) and defined as:

Hx, Hh, Hw, Hww, Hc, Hx, Hh, Hw, Hww, and Hcare the hot water consumption values, in gallons per-cycle (or liters per cycle) as measured in section 3.3 of this appendix for automatic clothes washers or section 3.4 of this appendix for semi-automatic clothes washers.

TUF, TUF, TUF, TUF, and TUFare temperature use factors for Extra-Hot Wash/Cold Rinse, Hot Wash/Cold Rinse, Warm Wash/Cold Rinse, Warm Wash/Warm Rinse, and Cold Wash/Cold Rinse temperature selections, respectively, as defined in Table 4.1.1 of this appendix.
