####### Opportunity to question at the public hearing.

(f)At any public hearing requested pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, with respect to disputed issues of material fact, OFE will provide any interested person an opportunity to question:

(1) Other interested persons who make oral presentations;

(2) Employees and contractors of the United States who have made written or oral presentations or who have participated in the development of the proposed rule or order or in the consideration of the petition for an exemption or permit; and

(3) Experts and consultants who have provided information to any person who makes an oral presentation and which is contained in or referred to in such presentation.

(g) OFE encourages persons who wish to question Government witnesses to submit their questions at least ten (10) days in advance of the hearing.

(h) The Presiding Officer will allow questions by any interested person to be asked of those making presentations or submitting information, data, analyses or views at the hearing. The Presiding Officer may restrict questioning if he determines that such questioning is duplicative or is not likely to result in a timely and effective resolution of issues pending in the administrative proceeding for which the hearing is being conducted.

(i) The Presiding Officer or OFE may exercise discretion to control a hearing by denying, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of participating in a particular OFE hearing if OFE finds, for example, that a person:

(1) Has knowingly made false or misleading statements, either orally or in writing;

(2) Has knowingly filed false affidavits or other writings;

(3) Lacks the specific authority to represent the person seeking an OFE action; or

(4) Has disrupted or is disrupting a hearing.
