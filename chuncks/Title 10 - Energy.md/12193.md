(a) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) provides a computerized calculation procedure to determine the most effective set of energy conservation measures, selected from among the measures included within the Program that will produce the practicable optimum life cycle cost for a type of residential building in a specific geographic location. The most effective set of energy conservation measures is expressed as a total point score that serves as the energy consumption goal.

(b) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) also prints out a point system that identifies a wide array of different energy conservation measures indicating how many points various levels of each measure would contribute to reaching the total point score of the energy consumption goal. This enables a Federal agency to use the energy consumption goal and the point system in the design and procurement procedures so that designers and builders can pick and choose among different combinations of energy conservation measures to meet or exceed the total point score required to meet the energy consumption goal.

(c) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) operates on a micro-computer system that uses the MS DOS operating system and is equipped with an 8087 co-processor.
