A.1 Test Method. To determine the weighted energy factor (WEF) for dedicated-purpose pool pumps, perform "wire-to-water" testing in accordance with HI 40.6-2014-B, except section 40.6.4.1, "Vertically suspended pumps"; section 40.6.4.2, "Submersible pumps"; section 40.6.5.3, "Test report"; section 40.6.5.5, "Test conditions"; section 40.6.5.5.2, "Speed of rotation during testing"; section 40.6.6.1, "Translation of test results to rated speed of rotation"; section 40.6.6.2, "Pump efficiency"; section 40.6.6.3, "Performance curve"; section A.7, "Testing at temperatures exceeding 30 &#xB0;C (86 &#xB0;F)"; and appendix B, "Reporting of test results"; (incorporated by reference, see ยง 431.463) with the modifications and additions as noted throughout the provisions below. Do not use the test points specified in section 40.6.5.5.1, "Test procedure" of HI 40.6-2014-B and instead use those test points specified in section D.3 of this appendix for the applicable dedicated-purpose pool pump variety and speed configuration. When determining overall efficiency, best efficiency point, or other applicable pump energy performance information, section 40.6.5.5.1, "Test procedure"; section 40.6.6.2, "Pump efficiency"; and section 40.6.6.3, "Performance curve" must be used, as applicable. For the purposes of applying this appendix, the term "volume per unit time," as defined in section 40.6.2, "Terms and definitions," of HI 40.6-2014-B shall be deemed to be synonymous with the term "flow rate" used throughout that standard and this appendix.
