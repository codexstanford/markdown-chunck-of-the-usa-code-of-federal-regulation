(1) Prices and charges for byproduct material sold pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2111 and 2112shall be either the full cost recovery price or the commercial price, whichever is higher, except that lower prices and charges may be established by the Department if it is determined that such lower prices and charges (i) will provide reasonable compensation to the Government for such material, (ii) will not discourage the use of or the development of sources of supply independent of the DOE of such material, and (iii) will encourage research and development.
