####### Validation of outdoor ventilation airflow rate.

(3)The outdoor ventilation airflow rate in cubic feet per minute ("CFM") of the basic model will be measured in accordance with ASHRAE 41.2-1987 and Section 6.4 of ASHRAE 37-2009 (both incorporated by reference, see ยง 429.4). All references to the inlet shall be determined to mean the outdoor air inlet.

(i) The outdoor ventilation airflow rate validation shall be conducted at the conditions specified in Table 3 of AHRI 390-2021 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 429.4), Full Load Standard Rating Capacity Test, Cooling, except for the following:

The outdoor ventilation airflow rate shall be determined at 0 in. HO external static pressure with a tolerance of -0.00/+0.05 in. HO.

(ii) When validating the outdoor ventilation airflow rate, the outdoor air inlet pressure shall be 0.00 in. HO, with a tolerance of -0.00/+0.05 in. HO when measured against the room ambient pressure.
