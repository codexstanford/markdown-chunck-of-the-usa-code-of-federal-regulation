###### Test Procedures
####### ยง 431.324 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency and standby mode energy consumption of metal halide lamp ballasts.
######## Test measurements.

(ii)(A) The ballast input power during operating conditions must be measured in accordance with the methods specified in Sections 6.1 and 6.8 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (R2020).

(B) The ballast output (lamp) power during operating conditions must be measured in accordance with the methods specified in Sections 6.2 and 6.10 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (R2020).

(C) For ballasts with a frequency of 60 Hz, the ballast input and output power shall be measured after lamps have been stabilized according to Section 4.4 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (R2020) using a wattmeter with accuracy specified in Section 4.5 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (R2020); and

(D) For ballasts with a frequency greater than 60 Hz, the ballast input and output power shall have a basic accuracy of +/-0.5 percent at the higher of either 3 times the output operating frequency of the ballast or 2.4 kHz.
