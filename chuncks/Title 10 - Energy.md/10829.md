####### Procedure for the Measurement of Condensate for a Condensing Commercial Packaged Boiler.

3.3.3.Collect flue condensate using a covered vessel so as to prevent evaporation. Measure the condensate from the flue gas during the "Test Period." Flue condensate mass must be measured within 5 minutes after the end of the "Test Period" (defined in C4.1.1.2 and C4.1.2.2 of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015) to prevent evaporation loss from the sample. Determine the mass of flue condensate for the "Test Period" by subtracting the tare container weight from the total weight of the container and flue condensate measured at the end of the "Warm-up Period."
