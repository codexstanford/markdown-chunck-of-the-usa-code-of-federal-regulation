####### Cool-down test for gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced-air central furnaces without stack dampers and with adjustable fan control.

8.6For a furnace with adjustable fan control, measure the time delay between burner shutdown and blower shutdown, t. This time delay, t, will be 3.0 minutes for non-condensing furnaces or 1.5 minutes for condensing furnaces or until the supply air temperature drops to a value of 40 &#xB0;F above the inlet air temperature, whichever results in the longest fan on-time. For a furnace without adjustable fan control or with the type of adjustable fan control whose range of adjustment does not allow for the time delay, t, specified above, bypass the fan control and manually control the fan to allow for the appropriate delay time as specified in section 9.5.1.2 of ASHRAE 103-1993. For a furnace that employs a single motor to drive both the power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, the power burner and indoor air circulating blower must be stopped at the same time.
