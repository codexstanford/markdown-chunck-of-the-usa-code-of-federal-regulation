(2) One kilogram or more of uranium or thorium source material in the operation of enrichment services, downblending uranium that has an initial enrichment of the Uisotope of 10 percent or more, or in the fabrication of mixed-oxide fuels shall complete and submit, in computer-readable format, Material Balance and Physical Inventory Listing Reports concerning source material that the licensee has received, produced, possessed, transferred, consumed, disposed, or lost. Reports must be submitted for each Reporting Identification Symbol (RIS) account including all holding accounts. Each licensee shall prepare and submit these reports as specified in the instructions in NUREG/BR-0007 and NMMSS Report D-24, "Personal Computer Data Input for NRC Licensees." These reports must document holdings as of September 30 of each year and submitted to the Commission within 30 days. Alternatively, these reports may be submitted with the licensee's material status reports on special nuclear material filed under part 72 or 74 of this chapter. Copies of the reporting instructions may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Fuel Management, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail toEach licensee required to report material balance, and inventory information, as described in this part, shall resolve any discrepancies identified during the report review and reconciliation process within 30 calendar days of the notification of a discrepancy identified by the NRC.

(c)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, each licensee who is authorized to possess uranium or thorium pursuant to a specific license shall notify the NRC Headquarters Operations Center by telephone, at the numbers listed in appendix A to part 73 of this chapter, of any incident in which an attempt has been made or is believed to have been made to commit a theft or unlawful diversion of more than 6.8 kilograms (kg) [15 pounds] of such material at any one time or more than 68 kg [150 pounds] of such material in any one calendar year.

(2) The licensee shall notify the NRC as soon as possible, but within 4 hours, of discovery of any incident in which an attempt has been made or is believed to have been made to commit a theft or unlawful diversion of such material.

(d) The reports described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are not required for:

(1) Processed ores containing less than five (5) percent of uranium or thorium, or any combination of uranium and thorium, by dry weight;

(2) Thorium contained in magnesium-thorium and tungsten-thorium alloys, if the thorium content in the alloys does not exceed 4 percent by weight;

(3) Chemical catalysts containing uranium depleted in the U-235 isotope to 0.4 percent or less, if the uranium content of the catalyst does not exceed 15 percent by weight; or

(4) Any source material contained in non-nuclear end use devices or components, including but not limited to permanently installed shielding, teletherapy, radiography, X-ray, accelerator devices, or munitions.
