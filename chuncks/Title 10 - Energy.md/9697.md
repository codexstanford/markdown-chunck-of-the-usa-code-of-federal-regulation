####### Automatic means for adjusting water temperature.

(iv)(A) The automatic means for adjusting water temperature as required under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section must automatically adjust the temperature of the water supplied by the boiler to ensure that an incremental change in inferred heat load produces a corresponding incremental change in the temperature of water supplied.

(B) For boilers that fire at a single input rate, the automatic means for adjusting water temperature requirement may be satisfied by providing an automatic means that allows the burner or heating element to fire only when the means has determined that the inferred heat load cannot be met by the residual heat of the water in the system.

(C) When there is no inferred heat load with respect to a hot water boiler, the automatic means described in this paragraph shall limit the temperature of the water in the boiler to not more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

(D) A boiler for which an automatic means for adjusting water temperature is required shall be operable only when the automatic means is installed.

(v) A boiler that is manufactured to operate without any need for electricity or any electric connection, electric gauges, electric pumps, electric wires, or electric devices is not required to meet the AFUE or design requirements applicable to the boiler requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, but must meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as applicable.
