####### Capacity rating at part-load.,i.e.

(9)When testing to determine EER for the part-load rating points (75-percent load, 50-percent load, and 25-percent load), if the measured capacity expressed as a percent of full-load capacity for a given part-load test is within three percent above or below the target part-load percentage, the EER calculated for the test may be used without any interpolation to determine IEER.
