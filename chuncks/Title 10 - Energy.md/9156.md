###### Appendix J to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Automatic and Semi-Automatic Clothes Washers
####### Clothes washers with multiple water fill control systems.

3.2.3.5If a clothes washer allows user selection among multiple water fill control systems, test all water fill control systems and, for each one, calculate the energy consumption (HE, ME, DE, and E) and water consumption (Q) values as set forth in section 4 of this appendix. Then, calculate the average of the tested values (one from each water fill control system) for each variable (HE, ME, DE, E, and Q) and use the average value for each variable in the final calculations in section 4 of this appendix.
