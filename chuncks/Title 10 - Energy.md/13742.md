######## Effects of suspension and termination.

(c)Costs resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable, unless the contracting officer expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently authorizes such costs. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination, which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable, are allowable if the costs:

(1) Result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable; and

(2) Would be allowable if the award expired normally at the end of the funding period.
