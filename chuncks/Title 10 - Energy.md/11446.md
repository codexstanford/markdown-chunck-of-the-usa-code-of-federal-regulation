####### Refrigeration Low Power Mode Validation Test Method.

2.3.2.1.This test method is not required for the certification of refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines. To verify the existence of a refrigeration low power mode, initiate the refrigeration low power mode in accordance with manufacturer instructions contained in product literature and manuals, after completion of the 6-hour low power mode test period. Continue recording all the data specified in section 2.2.6 of this appendix until existence of a refrigeration low power mode has been confirmed or denied. The refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine shall be deemed to have a refrigeration low power mode if either:

(a) The following three requirements have been satisfied:

(1) The instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature must reach at least 4 &#xB0;F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, within 6 hours.

(2) The instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature must be maintained at least 4 &#xB0;F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, for at least 1 hour.

(3) After the instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature is maintained at or above 4 &#xB0;F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, for at least 1 hour, the refrigerated beverage vending machine must return to the specified integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, automatically without direct physical intervention.

(b) Or, the compressor does not cycle on for the entire 6 hour period, in which case the instantaneous average beverage temperature does not have to reach 4 &#xB0;F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, but, the equipment must still automatically return to the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, after the 6 hour period without direct physical intervention.
