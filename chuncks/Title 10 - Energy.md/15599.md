###### Pressure systems,e.g.

means all pressure vessels, and pressure sources including cryogenics, pneumatic, hydraulic, and vacuum. Vacuum systems should be considered pressure systems due to their potential for catastrophic failure due to backfill pressurization. Associated hardware (, gauges and regulators), fittings, piping, pumps, and pressure relief devices are also integral parts of the pressure system.
