###### Weapons system simulator

means a device that closely simulates all major aspects of employing the corresponding actual firearm/weapons system, without firing live ammunition. The simulator should permit all weapons-handling and operational actions required by the actual weapon, and should allow the use of sight settings similar to the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads. Additionally, when weapons or weapons system simulators are used for qualification testing of protective force officers, the operation of the simulated weapon must closely approximate all weapons handling and operational manipulation actions required by the actual weapon. The simulation system must precisely register on-target hits and misses with accuracy comparable to the actual weapon at the same shooting distances. The weight, balance, and sighting systems should closely replicate those of the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads, and noise signatures and felt recoil should be simulated to the extent technically feasible.
