###### Pool heaters without a seasonal off switch.

4.3.2For all pool heaters without a seasonal off switch, record the average electric power consumption during the standby/off mode test, P= Pin W, in accordance with section 5 of IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3). For fossil fuel-fired pool heaters without a seasonal off switch, record the fossil fuel energy consumption during the off mode test, Q(= Q), in Btu. (Milli-volt electrical consumption need not be considered in units so equipped.) Ambient temperature and voltage specifications in section 4.1 of this appendix shall apply to this off mode testing. Round the recorded off mode power (P) to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10 W, record at least three significant figures.
