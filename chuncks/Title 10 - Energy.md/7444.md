####### Individual model/combination selection for testing.

(2)(i) The table identifies the minimum testing requirements for each basic model that includes multiple individual models/combinations; if a basic model spans multiple categories or subcategories listed in the table, multiple testing requirements apply. For each basic model that includes only one individual model/combination, test that individual model/combination. For single-split-system non-space-constrained air conditioners and heat pumps, when testing is required in accordance with 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M1, these requirements do not apply until July 1, 2024, provided that the manufacturer is certifying compliance of all basic models using an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section and paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of ยง 429.70.

(ii) Each individual model/combination (or "tested combination") identified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not required to be tested for P. Instead, at a minimum, among individual models/combinations with similar off-mode construction (even spanning different models of outdoor units), a manufacturer must test at least one individual model/combination for P.
