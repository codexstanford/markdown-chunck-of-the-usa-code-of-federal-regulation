####### Test load preparation.

2.7.2Dampen the load by agitating it in water whose temperature is 60 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F and consists of 0 to 17 parts per million hardness for approximately 2 minutes in order to saturate the fabric. Then, extract water from the wet test load by spinning the load to a target moisture content between 54.0-61.0 percent of the bone-dry weight of the test load. If after extraction the moisture content is less than 54.0 percent, make a final mass adjustment, such that the moisture content is between 54.0-61.0 percent of the bone-dry weight of the test load, by adding water uniformly distributed among all of the test cloths in a very fine spray using a spray bottle.
