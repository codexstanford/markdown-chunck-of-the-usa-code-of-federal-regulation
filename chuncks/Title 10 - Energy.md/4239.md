#### Appendix N to Part 52 - Standardization of Nuclear Power Plant Designs: Combined Licenses To Construct and Operate Nuclear Power Reactors of Identical Design at Multiple Sites

The Commission's regulations in part 2 of this chapter specifically provide for the holding of hearings on particular issues separately from other issues involved in hearings in licensing proceedings, and for the consolidation of adjudicatory proceedings and of the presentations of parties in adjudicatory proceedings such as licensing proceedings (§§ 2.316 and 2.317 of this chapter).

This appendix sets out the particular requirements and provisions applicable to situations in which applications for combined licenses under subpart C of this part are filed by one or more applicants for licenses to construct and operate nuclear power reactors of identical design ("common design") to be located at multiple sites.

1. Except as otherwise specified in this appendix or as the context otherwise indicates, the provisions of subpart C of this part and subpart D of part 2 of this chapter apply to combined license applications subject to this appendix.

2. Each combined license application submitted pursuant to this appendix must be submitted as specified in § 52.75 and 10 CFR 2.101. Each application must state that the applicant wishes to have the application considered under 10 CFR part 52, appendix N, and must list each of the applications to be treated together under this appendix.
