####### Overshoot test.

3.1.4.2Use the test methods set forth in Section 7.5.2.1 of IEC 60350-2 to determine the target turndown temperature for each cooking zone, Tc, in degrees Celsius, as follows.

If Tis within the tolerance of 70 +/- 0.5 &#xB0;C, the target turndown temperature is the highest of 80 &#xB0;C and the calculated Tc, rounded to the nearest integer. If Tis outside of the tolerance, the overshoot test is considered invalid and must be repeated after allowing the product to return to ambient conditions.
