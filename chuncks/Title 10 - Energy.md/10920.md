####### Manufacturer involvement in assessment or enforcement testing.

6.A manufacturer's representative will be allowed to witness assessment and/or enforcement testing for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps. The manufacturer's representative will be allowed to inspect and discuss set-up only with a DOE representative. During testing, the manufacturer's representative may adjust only the modulating components that are necessary to achieve steady-state operation in the presence of a DOE representative. Only previously documented specifications for set-up as specified under sections 4 and 5 of this appendix will be used.
