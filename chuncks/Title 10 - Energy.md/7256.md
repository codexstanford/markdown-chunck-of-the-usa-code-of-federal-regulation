###### Choosing a start year.

(b)The first entity statement describes the make-up, operations and boundaries of the entity, as they existed in the start year.

(1) For all entities, it is the year immediately preceding the first year for which the entity intends to register emission reductions and the last year of the initial base period(s).

(2) For entities intending to register emission reductions, the start year may be no earlier than 2002, unless the entity has made a commitment to reduce its entity-wide emissions under the Climate Leaders or Climate VISION program. An entity that has made such a commitment may establish a start year derived from the base period of the commitment, as long as it is no earlier than 2000.

(i) For a large emitter, the start year is the first year for which the entity submits a complete emissions inventory under the 1605(b) program.

(ii) The entity's emissions in its start year or its average annual emissions over a period of up to four years ending in the start year determine whether it qualifies to begin reporting as a small emitter.

(3) For entities not intending to register reductions, the start year may be no earlier than 1990.
