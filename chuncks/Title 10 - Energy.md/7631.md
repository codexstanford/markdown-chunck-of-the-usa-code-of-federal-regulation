###### ยง 429.43 Commercial heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC) equipment (excluding air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour cooling capacity).
####### e.g.,

(B) When certifying compliance an IEER standard: the integrated energy efficiency ratio (IEER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), the coefficient of performance (COP), the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), and the type(s) of heating used by the basic model (electric, gas, hydronic, none).

(iii) Packaged terminal air conditioners: The energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), the wall sleeve dimensions in inches (in), and the duration of the break-in period (hours).

(iv) Packaged terminal heat pumps: The energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/W-h)), the coefficient of performance (COP), the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), the wall sleeve dimensions in inches (in), and the duration of the break-in period (hours).

(v) Single package vertical air conditioners: The energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)) and the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(vi) Single package vertical heat pumps: The energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), the coefficient of performance (COP), and the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(vii) Variable refrigerant flow multi-split air-cooled air conditioners (other than air-cooled with rated cooling capacity less than 65,000 btu/h):

(A) When certifying compliance with an EER standard: The energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), and the type(s) of heating used by the basic model (e.g., electric, gas, hydronic, none).
