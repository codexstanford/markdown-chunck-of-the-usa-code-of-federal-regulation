####### i.e.,

3.6.1.1. With supply water temperature set as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (70 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F) the water flow rate can be varied so that the outlet water temperature is constant at 70 &#xB0;F +/- 2 &#xB0;F above the supply water temperature, while the burner is firing at full firing rate; and

3.6.1.2. After the water supply is turned off and the thermostat reduces the fuel supply to a minimum, the maximum heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T) is 140 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F.

3.6.1.3. If the water heater includes a built-in safety mechanism that prevents it from achieving a heat exchanger outlet water temperature of 140 &#xB0;F +/- 5 &#xB0;F, adjust the thermostat to its maximum setting.
