##### ยง 50.66 Requirements for thermal annealing of the reactor pressure vessel.
###### Reembrittlement Evaluations.

(ii)(A) The projected post-anneal reembrittlement of RTmust be calculated using the procedures in ยง 50.61(c), or must be determined using the same basis as that used for the pre-anneal operating period. The projected change due to post-anneal reembrittlement for Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined using the same basis as that used for the pre-anneal operating period.

(B) The post-anneal reembrittlement trend of both RTand Charpy upper-shelf energy must be estimated, and must be monitored using a surveillance program defined in the Thermal Annealing Report and which conforms to the intent of appendix H of this part, "Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program Requirements."
