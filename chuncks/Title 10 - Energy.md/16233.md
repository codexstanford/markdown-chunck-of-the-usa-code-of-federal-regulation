###### Potentially adverse conditions.

(c)(1) Expected changes in geohydrologic conditions-such as changes in the hydraulic gradient, the hydraulic conductivity, the effective porosity, and the ground-water flux through the host rock and the surrounding geohydrologic units-sufficient to significantly increase the transport of radionuclides to the accessible environment as compared with pre-waste-emplacement conditions.

(2) The presence of ground-water sources, suitable for crop irrigation or human consumption without treatment, along ground-water flow paths from the host rock to the accessible environment.

(3) The presence in the geologic setting of stratigraphic or structural features-such as dikes, sills, faults, shear zones, folds, dissolution effects, or brine pockets-if their presence could significantly contribute to the difficulty of characterizing or modeling the geohydrologic system.
