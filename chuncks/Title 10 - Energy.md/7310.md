##### ยง 300.11 Independent verification.
###### Scope of verification.

(d)(1) As part of any independent verification, qualified verifiers must use their expertise and professional judgment to verify for accuracy, completeness and consistency with DOE's guidelines of:

(i) The content of entity statements, annual reports and the supporting records maintained by the entity;

(ii) The representation in entity statements (or lack thereof) of any significant changes in entity boundaries, products, or processes;

(iii) The procedures and methods used to collect emissions and output data, and calculate emission reductions (for entities with widely dispersed operations, this process should include on-site reviews of a sample of the facilities);

(iv) Relevant personnel training and management systems; and

(v) Relevant quality assurance/quality control procedures.

(2) DOE expects qualified verifiers to refer to the growing body of literature on methods of evaluating the elements listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, such as the California Climate Action Registry Certification Protocol, the Climate Leaders Inventory Management Plan Checklist, and the draft ISO 14064.3 Protocol for Validation, Verification and Certification.
