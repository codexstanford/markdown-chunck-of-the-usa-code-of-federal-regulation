C.The requirements regarding test conditions presented in section I.C of this appendix apply to this section III. When testing pumps using a calibrated motor the following conditions also apply to the mains power supplied to the motor:

(1) Maintain the voltage within +/-5 percent of the rated value of the motor,

(2) Maintain the frequency within +/-1 percent of the rated value of the motor,

(3) Maintain the voltage unbalance of the power supply within +/-3 percent of the rated values of the motor, and

(2) Maintain total harmonic distortion below 12 percent throughout the test.
