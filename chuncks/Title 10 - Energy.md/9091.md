####### Simmering test.

3.3.1.3.3For each cooking zone, record the temperature of the water throughout the test, in degrees Celsius, and the values in sections 3.3.1.3.3.1 through 3.3.1.3.3.7 of this appendix for the Energy Test Cycle, if an Energy Test Cycle is measured in section 3.1.4.5 of this appendix, otherwise for both the maximum-below-threshold power setting and the minimum-above-threshold power setting. Because tmay not be known until completion of the simmering test, water temperature, any electrical energy consumption, and any gas volumetric consumption measurements may be recorded for several minutes after the end of the simmering period to ensure that the full simmering period is recorded.

3.3.1.3.3.1 The power setting under test.

3.3.1.3.3.2 The initial temperature of the water, in degrees Celsius, T.

3.3.1.3.3.3 The time at which the tester begins adjusting the cooking top control to change the power setting, to the nearest second, tand the turndown temperature, in degrees Celsius, Tc.

3.3.1.3.3.4 The time at which the simmering period starts, to the nearest second, t.

3.3.1.3.3.5 The time at which the simmering period ends, to the nearest second, tand the smoothened water temperature at the end of the simmering period, in degrees Celsius, T.

3.3.1.3.3.6 For a conventional electric cooking top, the electrical energy consumption from the start of the test to t, E, in watt-hours.

3.3.1.3.3.7 For a conventional gas cooking top, the volume of gas consumed from the start of the test to t, V, in cubic feet of gas; and any electrical energy consumption of the cooking top from the start of the test to t, E, in watt-hours.
