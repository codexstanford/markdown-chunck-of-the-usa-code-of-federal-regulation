###### Voltage and frequency independent UPS,,VFI UPS,

2.28.2.ormeans a UPS where the device remains in normal mode producing an AC output voltage and frequency that is independent of input voltage and frequency variations and protects the load against adverse effects from such variations without depleting the stored energy source.

VFI input dependency may be verified by performing the steady state input voltage tolerance test and the input frequency tolerance test in Sections 6.4.1.1 and 6.4.1.2 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 2.0 respectively, and observing that, at a minimum, the UPS produces an output voltage and frequency within the specified output range when the input voltage is varied by +/-10 percent of the rated input voltage and the input frequency is varied by +/-2 percent of the rated input frequency.
