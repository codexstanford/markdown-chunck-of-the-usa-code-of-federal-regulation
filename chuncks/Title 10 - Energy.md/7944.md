(3)For manufacturers whose models of air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h or air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h are otherwise identical to their central air conditioner and heat pump models (meaning differing only in phase or voltage of the electrical system and the phase or voltage of power input for which the motors and compressors are designed) and who have validated an AEDM for the otherwise identical central air conditioners and heat pumps under ยง 429.70(e)(2), no additional validation is required. For manufacturers whose models of air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h or air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h who have not validated an AEDM for otherwise identical central air conditioners and heat pumps under ยง 429.70(e)(2) must, before using an AEDM, validate the AEDM's accuracy and reliability as follows:
