###### ยง 429.70 Alternative methods for determining energy efficiency and energy use.
####### Alternate Efficiency Determination Method (AEDM) for air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with less than 65,000 Btu/h cooling capacity,Applicability.

(l)-(1)(i) For air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h subject to standards in terms of seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) and heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF), representations with respect to the energy use or efficiency, including compliance certifications, are subject to the requirements in ยง 429.70(c) of this title as it appeared in the 10 CFR parts 200-499 edition revised as of January 1, 2021.

(ii) For air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h subject to standards in terms of seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 (SEER2) and heating seasonal performance factor 2 (HSPF2) metrics, representations with respect to the energy use or efficiency, including compliance certifications, are subject to the requirements in this section. If manufacturers choose to certify compliance with any standards in terms of SEER2 and HSPF2 prior to the applicable compliance date for those standards, the requirements of this section must be followed.
