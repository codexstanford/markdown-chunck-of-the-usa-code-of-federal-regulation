7.3Adjust the burners of gas-fired boilers to their maximum Btu input ratings at the normal test pressure specified by section 7.1 of this appendix. Correct the burner input rate to reflect gas characteristics at a temperature of 60 &#xB0;F and atmospheric pressure of 30 in of Hg and adjust to within +/-2 percent of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating specified by the manufacturer as measured at the maximum input rate during the steady-state performance test in section 8 of this appendix. Set the primary air shutters in accordance with the I&O manual to give a good flame at this condition. If, however, the setting results in the deposit of carbon on the burners during any test specified herein, the tester shall adjust the shutters and burners until no more carbon is deposited and shall perform the tests again with the new settings (Figure 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017). After the steady-state performance test has been started, do not make additional adjustments to the burners during the required series of performance tests specified in section 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017. If a vent-limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, keep it in place during all tests.
