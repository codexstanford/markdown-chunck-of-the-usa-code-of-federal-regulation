##### Appendix Y1 to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Battery Chargers

This appendix provides the test requirements used to measure the energy consumption of battery chargers, including fixed-location wireless chargers designed for charging batteries with less than 100 watt-hour battery energy and open-placement wireless chargers, operating at either DC or United States AC line voltage (nominally 115V at 60Hz). This appendix also provides the test requirements used to measure the energy efficiency of uninterruptible power supplies as defined in section 2 of this appendix that utilize the standardized National Electrical Manufacturer Association (NEMA) plug, 1-15P or 5-15P, as specified in ANSI/NEMA WD 6-2016 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3) and have an AC output. This appendix does not provide a method for testing back-up battery chargers.

The following definitions are for the purposes of explaining the terminology associated with the test method for measuring battery charger energy consumption.

For clarity on any other terminology used in the test method, please refer to IEEE 1515-2000, (Sources for information and guidance, see ยง 430.4).
