###### Voltage and frequency dependent UPS,VFD UPS

2.28.1.ormeans a UPS that produces an AC output where the output voltage and frequency are dependent on the input voltage and frequency. This UPS architecture does not provide corrective functions like those in voltage independent and voltage and frequency independent systems.

VFD input dependency may be verified by performing the AC input failure test in Section 6.2.2.7 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 2.0 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3) and observing that, at a minimum, the UPS switches from normal mode of operation to battery power while the input is interrupted.
