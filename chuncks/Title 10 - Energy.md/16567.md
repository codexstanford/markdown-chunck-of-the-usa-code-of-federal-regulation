##### Notice for Sharing of CEII not Generated by DOE.

(5)The DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee will provide electronic notice to the CEII submitter no less than ten (10) business days before DOE releases CEII submitted to and not generated by DOE, except in instances where voluntary sharing is necessary for law enforcement purposes, to ensure reliable operation or maintenance of electric or energy infrastructure, to maintain infrastructure security, or to address potential threats; where there is an urgent need to quickly disseminate the information; or where prior notice is not practicable due to an emergency or other unforeseen circumstance. If prior notice is not given, DOE will provide notice as soon as practicable. The DOE CEII Coordinator or Coordinator's designee will convene a phone call within five (5) business days of electronic notice with the CEII submitter to discuss concerns about the proposed release of CEII-designated materials to the requester. DOE will make the final determination as to whether to share CEII not generated by DOE.
