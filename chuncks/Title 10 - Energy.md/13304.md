####### Suspension.

(c)(1) Unless DOE and the awardee agree otherwise, no period of suspension shall exceed 90 days.

(3) If the suspension has not been cancelled by the expiration date of the period of suspension, the awardee shall resume the suspended activities or project unless, prior to the expiration date, DOE notifies the awardee in writing that the period of suspension shall be extended consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that the award shall be terminated.

(4) As of the effective date of the suspension, DOE shall withhold further payments and shall allow new obligations incurred by the awardee during the period of suspension only if such costs were authorized in the notice of suspension or in a subsequent letter.

(5) If the suspension is cancelled or expires and the award is not terminated, DOE shall reimburse the awardee for any authorized allowable costs incurred during the suspension and, if necessary, may amend the award to extend the period of performance.
