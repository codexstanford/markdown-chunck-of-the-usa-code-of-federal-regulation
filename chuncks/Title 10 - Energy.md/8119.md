####### Verification of blade revolutions per minute (RPM) measured at high speed.

(3)DOE will measure the blade RPM at high speed pursuant to the test requirements of 10 CFR part 430 of this chapter for each unit tested. DOE will consider the represented blade RPM measured at high speed valid only if the measurement(s) (either the measured value for a single unit, or the mean of the measured values for a multiple unit sample, rounded to the nearest RPM) are within 2 percent of the represented blade RPM at high speed.

(i) If DOE determines that the represented RPM is valid, that RPM will be used as the basis for determining the product class.

(ii) If DOE determines that the represented RPM is invalid, DOE will use the rounded measured RPM(s) as the basis for determining the product class.
