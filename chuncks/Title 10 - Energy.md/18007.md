### PART 1706 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS
#### ยง 1706.7 Procedures.
##### Pre-award disclosure and resolution of OCIs.

(a)If a certificate under ยง 1706.6 indicates, or the Board otherwise learns, that actual or potential OCIs could be, or would appear to be, created by contract award to a particular offeror, the Board shall afford the affected offeror an opportunity to provide in writing all relevant facts bearing on the certificate. If the Board thereafter determines that an actual or potential OCI exists, one of the following actions shall ultimately be taken:

(1) Disqualify the offeror;

(2) Include in the contract appropriate terms and conditions which avoid the conflict, in which case no waiver is required; or

(3) Make a finding that it is in the best interests of the Government to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions of ยง 1706.8, and, where reasonably possible, include contract terms and conditions or take other measures which mitigate such conflicts.
