(2) Possesses, or had possessed in the previous reporting period, one kilogram or more of uranium or thorium source material pursuant to the operation of enrichment services, downblending uranium that has an initial enrichment of the Uisotope of 10 percent or more, or in the fabrication of mixed-oxide fuels shall complete and submit, in computer-readable format, Material Balance and Physical Inventory Listing Reports concerning all source material that the licensee has received, produced, possessed, transferred, consumed, disposed of, or lost. Reports must be submitted for each Reporting Identification Symbol (RIS) account including all holding accounts. Each licensee shall prepare and submit these reports as specified in the instructions in NUREG/BR-0007 and NMMSS Report D-24, "Personal Computer Data Input for NRC Licensees." These reports must document holdings as of September 30 of each year and must be submitted to the Commission within 30 days. Alternatively, these reports may be submitted with the licensee's material status reports on special nuclear material filed under parts 72 or 74 of this chapter. Copies of the reporting instructions may be obtained either by writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Fuel Management, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail toEach licensee required to report material balance, inventory, and/or foreign obligation information, as detailed in this part, shall resolve any discrepancies identified during the report review and reconciliation process within 30 calendar days of notification of a discrepancy identified by the NRC.

(1) Processed ores containing less than five (5) percent of uranium or thorium, or any combination of uranium or thorium, by dry weight;

(2) Thorium contained in magnesium-thorium and tungsten-thorium alloys, if the thorium content in the alloys does not exceed 4 percent by weight;

(3) Chemical catalysts containing uranium depleted in the U-235 isotope to 0.4 percent or less, if the uranium content of the catalyst does not exceed 15 percent by weight; or

(4) Any source material contained in non-nuclear end use devices or components, including but not limited to permanently installed shielding, teletherapy, radiography, X-ray, accelerator devices, or munitions.

(e) Any licensee who is required to submit inventory change reports and material status reports pursuant to part 75 of this chapter (pertaining to implementation of the US/IAEA Safeguards Agreement) shall prepare and submit such reports only as provided in §§ 75.34 and 75.35 of this chapter (instead of as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section).
