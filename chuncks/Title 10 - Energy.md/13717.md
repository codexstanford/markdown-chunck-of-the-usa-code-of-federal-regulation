(a) Title vests in the recipient upon acquisition of supplies acquired with Federal funds under an award.

(b) Upon termination or completion of the project or program, the recipient may retain any unused supplies. If the inventory of unused supplies exceeds $5,000 in total aggregate value and the items are not needed for any other Federally sponsored project or program, the recipient may retain the items for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but must, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share.
