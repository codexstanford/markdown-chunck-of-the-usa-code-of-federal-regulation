Clarifying further, IEC 62301 section 4.4,and section 5,apply in lieu of ASHRAE 103-2017 section 6.10,Measure the wattage so that all possible standby mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the standby mode wattage of a single auxiliary. Round the recorded standby power (P) to the second decimal place, except for loads greater than or equal to 10W, which must be recorded to at least three significant figures.
