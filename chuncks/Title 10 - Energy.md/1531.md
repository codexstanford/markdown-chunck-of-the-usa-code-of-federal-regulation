###### Dedication.

(1) When applied to nuclear power plants licensed pursuant to 10 CFR part 50, dedication is an acceptance process undertaken to provide reasonable assurance that a commercial grade item to be used as a basic component will perform its intended safety function and, in this respect, is deemed equivalent to an item designed and manufactured under a 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, quality assurance program. This assurance is achieved by identifying the critical characteristics of the item and verifying their acceptability by inspections, tests, or analyses performed by the purchaser or third-party dedicating entity after delivery, supplemented as necessary by one or more of the following: commercial grade surveys; product inspections or witness at holdpoints at the manufacturer's facility, and analysis of historical records for acceptable performance. In all cases, the dedication process must be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of 10 CFR part 50, appendix B. The process is considered complete when the item is designated for use as a basic component.

(2) When applied to facilities and activities licensed pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30, 40, 50 (other than nuclear power plants), 60, 61, 63, 70, 71, or 72, dedication occurs after receipt when that item is designated for use as a basic component.
