####### Stopping Criteria.

7.3.3.Stop the test when one of the following occurs:

7.3.3.1. The heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T) decreases by 35 &#xB0;F from its value recorded immediately after the main burner(s) has cut-out, and the pump purge operation (if applicable) is complete; or

7.3.3.2. 24 hours have elapsed from the start of the test.

7.3.4. At the end of the test, record the final heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T), fuel consumed, electricity consumed from time t=0, and the time elapsed from the start of the test.

7.3.5.1. Once the test is complete, use the following equation to calculate the standby loss as a percentage (per hour) of the heat content of the stored water above room temperature:

7.3.5.2. The standby loss expressed in terms of Btu per hour must be calculated as follows:

SL (Btu per hour) = S (% per hour) x 8.25 (Btu/gal- &#xB0;F) x Measured Volume (gal) x 70 ( &#xB0;F)

Where, SL refers to the standby loss of the water heater, defined as the amount of energy required to maintain the stored water temperature expressed in Btu per hour.
