####### [object Object],&#x116;

Use Equations 4.2.4-1 and 4.2.4-2 to this appendix, respectively, to calculate(35) and(35), whether or not the heat pump is a minimum-speed-limiting variable-speed heat pump.

For variable-speed non-communicating coil-only heat pumps, there is no intermediate speed.

Evaluate the Equation 4.2-1 to this appendix quantities:
