() The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.03, where:

(2) Any represented values of measures of energy efficiency or energy consumption for all individual models represented by a given basic model must be the same.

(3) Represented values of CCT must be equal to the arithmetic mean of the sample.

(4) Represented values of lifetime must be equal to or less than the median time to failure of the sample (calculated as the arithmetic mean of the time to failure of the two middle sample units (or the value of the middle sample unit if there are an odd number of units) when the measured values are sorted in value order).

(5) Calculate represented values of life (in years) by dividing the represented lifetime of these lamps as determined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the estimated daily operating hours as specified in 16 CFR 305.23(b)(3)(iii) multiplied by 365.

(6) Represented values of the estimated annual energy cost, expressed in dollars per year, must be the product of the rated wattage in kilowatts, an electricity cost rate as specified in 16 CFR 305.23(b)(1)(ii), and an estimated average daily use as specified in 16 CFR 305.23(b)(1)(ii) multiplied by 365.
