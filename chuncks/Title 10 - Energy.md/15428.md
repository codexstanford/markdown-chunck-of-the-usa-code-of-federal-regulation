The non-uniform equivalent dose (H) to the irradiated area received during the year shall be added to any uniform equivalent dose also received by the skin and recorded as the equivalent dose to any extremity or skin for the year. H is the equivalent dose averaged over the 1 cmof skin receiving the maximum absorbed dose, D, reduced by the fraction f, which is the irradiated area in cmdivided by 100 cm(, H = fD). In no case shall a value of f less than 0.1 be used.
