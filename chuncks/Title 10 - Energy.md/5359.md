## Chapter I - Nuclear Regulatory Commission
### PART 72 - LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INDEPENDENT STORAGE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL, HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE, AND REACTOR-RELATED GREATER THAN CLASS C WASTE
#### Subpart F - General Design Criteria
##### ยง 72.128 Criteria for spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, reactor-related greater than Class C waste, and other radioactive waste storage and handling.
###### Spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and reactor-related GTCC waste storage and handling systems.

(a)Spent fuel storage, high-level radioactive waste storage, reactor-related GTCC waste storage and other systems that might contain or handle radioactive materials associated with spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, or reactor-related GTCC waste, must be designed to ensure adequate safety under normal and accident conditions. These systems must be designed with-

(1) A capability to test and monitor components important to safety,

(2) Suitable shielding for radioactive protection under normal and accident conditions,

(3) Confinement structures and systems,

(4) A heat-removal capability having testability and reliability consistent with its importance to safety, and

(5) means to minimize the quantity of radioactive wastes generated.
