(d)The records required under this section should be protected from public disclosure because of their personal privacy nature. These records are protected by most State privacy laws and, when transferred to the NRC, are protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR part 9.

(e) The licensee shall maintain the records of dose to an embryo/fetus with the records of dose to the declared pregnant woman. The declaration of pregnancy shall also be kept on file, but may be maintained separately from the dose records.

(f) The licensee shall retain the required form or record until the Commission terminates each pertinent license requiring this record. This includes records required under the standards for protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994.
