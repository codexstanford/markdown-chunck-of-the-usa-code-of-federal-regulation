####### Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.

(a)(1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to automatic commercial ice makers; and

(2) For each basic model of automatic commercial ice maker selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that any represented value of energy use, condenser water use, or other measure of consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(i) The mean of the sample, where:

And, xis the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xis the isample; or,

(ii) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where:

And xis the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and tis the t statistic for a 95 percent two-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to this subpart).

(3) The harvest rate of a basic model is the mean of the measured harvest rates for each tested unit of the basic model, based on the same tests to determine energy use and condenser water use, if applicable. Round the mean harvest rate to the nearest pound of ice per 24 hours (lb/24 h) for harvest rates above 50 lb/24 h; round the mean harvest rate to the nearest 0.1 lb/24 h for harvest rates less than or equal to 50 lb/24 h.
