An expenditure-based TIA is an assistance instrument subject to the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), so nonprofit participants are subject to the requirements under that Act and OMB Circular A-133. Specifically, the requirements are those in:

(a) 10 CFR 600.226 for State and local governments; and

(b) 10 CFR 600.126 for other nonprofit organizations.
