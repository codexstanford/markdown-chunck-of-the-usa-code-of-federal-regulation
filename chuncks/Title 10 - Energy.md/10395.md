###### Furnace fans for which the maximum airflow-control setting is a default heating airflow-control setting.

8.6.1.2.Adjust the main burner or electric heating element controls to the default heat setting designated for the maximum airflow-control setting. Burner adjustments shall be made as specified by section 8.4.1 of ASHRAE 103-2007 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). Adjust the furnace fan controls to the maximum airflow-control setting. Adjust the external static to within the range shown in Table 1 by symmetrically restricting the outlet of the test duct. Maintain these settings until steady-state conditions are attained as specified in section 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 of this appendix and the temperature rise (ΔT) is at least 18 &#xB0;F. Measure furnace fan electrical input power (E), fuel or electric resistance heat kit input energy (Q), external static pressure (ESP), steady-state efficiency for this setting (Effy) as specified in sections 11.2 and 11.3 of ASHRAE 103-2007, outlet air temperature (T), and temperature rise (ΔT)

Once the specified ESP has been achieved, the same outlet duct restrictions shall be used for the remainder of the furnace fan test.
