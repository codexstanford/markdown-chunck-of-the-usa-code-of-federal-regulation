d. Measurefor coil-only split systems and for blower coil split systems for which a furnace or a modular blower is the designated air mover: Disconnect all low-voltage wiring for thecomponents andcontrols from the low-voltage transformer. Determine the average power from non-zero value data measured over a 5-minute interval of the power supplied to the (remaining) low-voltage components of the central air conditioner or heat pump, or low-voltage power,. This power measurement does not include line power supplied to the outdoor unit. It is the line power supplied to the air mover, or, if a compatible transformer is used instead of an air mover, it is the line power supplied to the transformer primary coil. If a compatible transformer is used instead of an air mover and power output of the low-voltage secondary circuit is measured,is zero.
