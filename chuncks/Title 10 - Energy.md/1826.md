###### Quality control requirements for performing initial drug tests.

(d)(1) Any initial drug test of urine performed by an HHS-certified laboratory must use an immunoassay that meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution. Non-instrumented immunoassay testing devices that are pending HHS/SAMHSA review and approval may not be used for initial drug testing under this part.

(2) HHS-certified laboratories may perform multiple initial drug tests for the same drug or drug class, provided that all tests meet the cutoffs and quality control requirements of this part. For example, an HHS-certified laboratory may use immunoassay technique "A" for all drugs using the licensee's or other entity's cutoff levels, but specimens testing positive for amphetamines may also be tested using immunoassay technique "B" to eliminate any possible positives due to structural analogues; or, a valid analytical result cannot be obtained using immunoassay technique "A" and immunoassay technique "B" is used in an attempt to obtain a valid analytical result.

(3) Quality control samples for each analytical run of specimens for initial testing must include-

(i) At least one control certified to contain no drug or drug metabolite;

(ii) At least one positive control with the drug or drug metabolite targeted at 25 percent above the cutoff;

(iii) At least one positive control with the drug or drug metabolite targeted at 75 percent of the cutoff;

(iv) A sufficient number of calibrators to ensure and document the linearity of the assay method over time in the concentration area of the cutoff (after acceptable values are obtained for the known calibrators, those values will be used to calculate sample data); and

(v) At least one control that appears to be a donor specimen to the laboratory analysts.
