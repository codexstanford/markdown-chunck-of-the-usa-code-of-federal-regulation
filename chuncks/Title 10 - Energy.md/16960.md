(2) Based on a determination by the Director that a person has violated or is continuing to violate an UCNI security requirement, the Director may issue to the person a final notice of violation that concisely states the determined violation, the amount of any civil penalty imposed, and further actions necessary by or available to the person. The final notice of violation also must state that the person has the right to submit to the Director, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the notice, a written request for a hearing under paragraph (i) of this section.

(A) A waiver of further proceedings; or

(B) A request for an on-the-record hearing under paragraph (i) of this section.

(5) If a person waives further proceedings, the final notice of violation shall be deemed a final order enforceable against the person. The person must pay the civil penalty set forth in the notice of violation within 60 days of the filing of waiver unless the Director grants additional time.
