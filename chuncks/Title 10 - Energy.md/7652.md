###### ยง 429.46 Commercial clothes washers.
####### Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.

(a)(1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to commercial clothes washers; and

(2) For each basic model of commercial clothes washers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that-

(i) Any represented value of the integrated water factor or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The upper 97percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the modified energy factor, active-mode energy efficiency ratio, water efficiency ratio, or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The lower 97percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

(3) The clothes container capacity of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the measured clothes container capacity (C) of all tested units of the basic model.

(4) The corrected remaining moisture content (RMC) of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the final RMC value measured for all tested units of the basic model.
