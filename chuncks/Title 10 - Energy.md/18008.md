### PART 1706 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS
#### ยง 1706.7 Procedures.
##### Post-award disclosure and resolution of OCIs.

(b)(1) If, after contract award, the contractor discovers actual or potential OCIs with respect to the contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This statement shall include a description of the action that the contractor has taken or proposes to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.

(2) If a disclosure under this section indicates, or the Board otherwise learns, that actual or potential OCIs exist, the Board may afford the contractor an opportunity to provide all relevant facts bearing upon the problem. If at any time the Board determines that an actual or potential OCI exists, one of the following actions shall ultimately be taken:

(i) Terminate the contract, or, in the case of a task order contract, terminate the particular task;

(ii) Insist on appropriate contract terms and conditions which avoid the OCIs, in which case no waiver is required; or

(iii) Make a finding that it is in the best interests of the Government to permit the contractor to continue to perform the contract (or task) under the waiver provisions of ยง 1706.8, and, where reasonably possible, insist on appropriate contract terms and conditions or take other measures which mitigate the OCIs.
