Determine Q(47) and(47) from the H1test and the calculations specified in section 3.7 of this appendix. See section 3.6.4.b of this appendix regarding determination of the capacity(47) and power input(47) used in the HSPF2 calculations to represent the H1Test. Determine(35) and(35) from the H2test and the calculations specified in section 3.9 of this appendix or, if the H2test is not conducted, by conducting the calculations specified in section 3.6.4 of this appendix. Determine(17) and(17) from the H3test and the methods specified in section 3.10 of this appendix.

d. Full Compressor Speed for Heat Pumps for which the H4test is Conducted. For Tabove 17 &#xB0;F, evaluate the space heating capacity, Q(T), and electrical power consumption, E(T), of the heat pump when operating at full compressor speed as described above for heat pumps for which the H4is not conducted. For Tbetween 5 &#xB0;F and 17 &#xB0;F, evaluate the space heating capacity, Q(T), and electrical power consumption, E(T), of the heat pump when operating at full compressor speed using the following equations:
