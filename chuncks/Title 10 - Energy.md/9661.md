####### Measurement of jacket surface temperature.,See

7.7Divide the jacket of the furnace into 6-inch squares when practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4-inch by 9-inch or 3-inch by 12-inch sections, and determine the surface temperature at the center of each square or section with a surface thermocouple. Record the surface temperature of the 36-square-inch areas in groups where the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch areas is less than 10 &#xB0;F for temperature up to 100 &#xB0;F above room temperature, and less than 20 &#xB0;F for temperatures more than 100 &#xB0;F above room temperature. For forced-air central furnaces, the circulating air blower compartment is considered as part of the duct system, and no surface temperature measurement of the blower compartment needs to be recorded for the purpose of this test. For downflow furnaces, measure all cabinet surface temperatures of the heat exchanger and combustion section, including the bottom around the outlet duct and the burner door, using the 36-square-inch thermocouple grid. The cabinet surface temperatures around the blower section do not need to be measured (Figure 3-E of ASHRAE 103-1993).
