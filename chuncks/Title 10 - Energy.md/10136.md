## Chapter II - Department of Energy
### Subchapter D - Energy Conservation
#### PART 430 - ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS
##### Appendix X to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Dehumidifiers

Until January 27, 2016, manufacturers must either test portable dehumidifiers in accordance with this appendix, or the previous version of this appendix as it appeared in the Code of Federal Regulations on January 1, 2015. DOE notes that, because testing under this appendix X must be completed as of January 27, 2016, manufacturers may wish to begin using this test procedure immediately.

Alternatively, manufacturers may certify compliance with any amended energy conservation standards for portable dehumidifiers prior to the compliance date of those amended energy conservation standards by testing in accordance with appendix X1. Any representations made with respect to the energy use or efficiency of such portable dehumidifiers must be in accordance with whichever version is selected.

Any representations made on or after the compliance date of any amended energy conservation standards, with respect to the energy use or efficiency of portable or whole-home dehumidifiers, must be made in accordance with the results of testing pursuant to appendix X1.

This appendix covers the test requirements used to measure the energy performance of dehumidifiers.

2.1 ANSI/AHAM DH-1 means the test standard published by the American National Standards Institute and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, titled "Dehumidifiers," ANSI/AHAM DH-1-2008, (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3).
