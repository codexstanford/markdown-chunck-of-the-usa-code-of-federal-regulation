###### § 429.15 Room air conditioners.
####### Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.

(a)(1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to room air conditioners; and

(2) For each basic model of room air conditioners, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that-

(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) The upper 97percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the combined energy efficiency ratio (CEER) (determined in § 430.23(f)(3) for each unit in the sample) or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) The lower 97percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

(3) The cooling capacity of a basic model is the mean of the measured cooling capacities for each tested unit of the basic model, as determined in § 430.23(f)(1) of this chapter. Round the cooling capacity value to the nearest hundred.

(4) The electrical power input of a basic model is the mean of the measured electrical power inputs for each tested unit of the basic model, as determined in § 430.23(f)(2) of this chapter. Round the electrical power input to the nearest ten.

(5) Round the value of CEER for a basic model to one decimal place.
