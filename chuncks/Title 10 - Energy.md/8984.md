If the microwave oven can communicate through a network (Bluetooth&#xAE; or internet connection), disable the network function, if it is possible to disable it by means provided in the manufacturer's user manual, for the duration of testing. If the network function cannot be disabled, or means for disabling the function are not provided in the manufacturer's user manual, test the microwave oven with the network function in the factory default setting or in the as-shipped condition as instructed in Section 5, paragraph 5.2 of IEC 62301 (Second Edition). Configure the unit such that the clock display remains on during testing, regardless of manufacturer's instructions or default setting or supplied setting, unless the clock display powers down automatically with no option for the consumer to override this function. Install a watt meter in the circuit that meets the requirements of section 2.8.1.2 of this appendix.
