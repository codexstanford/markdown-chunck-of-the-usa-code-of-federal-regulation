####### Power Input Determination.

5.2.3For all water heaters except electric types, initiate normal operation (as described in section 5.1) and determine the power input, P, to the main burners (including pilot light power, if any) after 15 minutes of operation. If the water heater is equipped with a gas appliance pressure regulator, the regulator outlet pressure shall be set within +/-10% of that recommended by the manufacturer. For oil-fired water heaters, the fuel pump pressure shall be within +/-10% of the manufacturer's specified pump pressure. Adjust all burners to achieve an hourly Btu (kJ) rating that is within +/-2% of the value specified by the manufacturer. For an oil-fired water heater, adjust the burner to give a COreading recommended by the manufacturer and an hourly Btu (kJ) rating that is within +/-2% of that specified by the manufacturer. Smoke in the flue may not exceed No. 1 smoke as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3).
