#### PART 300 - VOLUNTARY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM: GENERAL GUIDELINES
##### ยง 300.1 General.
###### Periodic review and updating of General and Technical Guidelines.

(f)DOE intends periodically to review the General Guidelines and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see ยง 300.13) to determine whether any changes are warranted; DOE anticipates these reviews will occur approximately once every three years. These reviews will consider any new developments in climate science or policy, the participation rates of large and small emitters in the 1605(b) program, the general quality of the data submitted by different participants, and any changes to other emissions reporting protocols. Possible changes may include, but are not limited to:

(1) The addition of greenhouse gases that have been demonstrated to have significant, quantifiable climate forcing effects when released to the atmosphere in significant quantities;

(2) Changes to the minimum, quantity-weighted quality rating for emission inventories;

(3) Updates to emission inventory methods, emission factors and other provisions that are contained in industry protocols or standards. The review may also consider updates to any government-developed and consensus-based emission factors for which automatic updating is not provided in the Technical Guidelines;

(4) Modifications to the benchmarks or emission conversion factors used to calculate avoided and indirect emissions; and

(5) Changes in the minimum requirements for registered emission reductions.
