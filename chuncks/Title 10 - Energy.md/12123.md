####### Window Management.

516.4For the Prototype and Reference Building, window management drapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for setting the Energy Cost Budget. No draperies shall be the default assumption for computing the Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is assumed to be internally shaded by medium-weight draperies, closed one-half time. The draperies shall be modeled by assuming that one-half the area in each zone is draped and one-half is not. If manually-operated draperies, shades, or blinds are to be used in the Proposed Design, the Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by assuming they are effective over one-half the glazing area in each zone.
