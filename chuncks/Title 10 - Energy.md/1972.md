#### Exemptions
##### § 30.15 Certain items containing byproduct material.

(a) Except for persons who apply byproduct material to, or persons who incorporate byproduct material into, the following products, or persons who initially transfer for sale or distribution the following products containing byproduct material, any person is exempt from the requirements for a license set forth in section 81 of the Act and from the regulations in parts 20 and 30 through 36 and 39 of this chapter to the extent that such person receives, possesses, uses, transfers, owns, or acquires the following products:

(1) Timepieces or hands or dials containing not more than the following specified quantities of byproduct material and not exceeding the following specified levels of radiation:

(i) 25 millicuries of tritium per timepiece,

(ii) 5 millicuries of tritium per hand,

(iii) 15 millicuries of tritium per dial (bezels when used shall be considered as part of the dial),

(iv) 100 microcuries of promethium 147 per watch or 200 microcuries of promethium 147 per any other timepiece,

(v) 20 microcuries of promethium 147 per watch hand or 40 microcuries of promethium 147 per other timepiece hand,

(vi) 60 microcuries of promethium 147 per watch dial or 120 microcuries of promethium 147 per other timepiece dial (bezels when used shall be considered as part of the dial),

(vii) The levels of radiation from hands and dials containing promethium 147 will not exceed, when measured through 50 milligrams per square centimeter of absorber:

(A) For wrist watches, 0.1 millirad per hour at 10 centimeters from any surface,

(B) For pocket watches, 0.1 millirad per hour at 1 centimeter from any surface,

(C) For any other timepiece, 0.2 millirad per hour at 10 centimeters from any surface.

(viii) 0.037 megabecquerel (1 microcurie) of radium-226 per timepiece in intact timepieces manufactured prior to November 30, 2007.

(2)(i) Static elimination devices which contain, as a sealed source or sources, byproduct material consisting of a total of not more than 18.5 MBq (500 µCi) of polonium-210 per device.

(ii) Ion generating tubes designed for ionization of air that contain, as a sealed source or sources, byproduct material consisting of a total of not more than 18.5 MBq (500 µCi) of polonium-210 per device or of a total of not more than 1.85 GBq (50 mCi) of hydrogen-3 (tritium) per device.

(iii) Such devices authorized before October 23, 2012 for use under the general license then provided in § 31.3 and equivalent regulations of Agreement States and manufactured, tested, and labeled by the manufacturer in accordance with the specifications contained in a specific license issued by the Commission.

(3) Balances of precision containing not more than 1 millicurie of tritium per balance or not more than 0.5 millicurie of tritium per balance part manufactured before December 17, 2007.

(4) [Reserved]

(5) Marine compasses containing not more than 750 millicuries of tritium gas and other marine navigational instruments containing not more than 250 millicuries of tritium gas manufactured before December 17, 2007.

(6) [Reserved]

(7) Ionization chamber smoke detectors containing not more than 1 microcurie (µCi) of americium-241 per detector in the form of a foil and designed to protect life and property from fires.
