### PART 1045 - NUCLEAR CLASSIFICATION AND DECLASSIFICATION
#### Subpart D - Classifying and Declassifying Matter Containing RD, FRD, or TFNI
##### ยง 1045.130 How does an authorized person derivatively classify matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI?
###### RD, FRD, or TFNI classification based on compilation.

(2)A large number of often similar unclassified pieces of information or a large number of often similar RD, FRD, or TFNI pieces of information by selection, arrangement, or completeness in matter may add sufficient value to merit classification or to merit classification at a higher level. If there is a classification guide topic that applies to the compilation, an RD Derivative Classifier may classify the information by compilation. In the absence of a classification guide topic that applies, for RD or TFNI, the Director, Office of Classification, may make the determination to classify or upgrade the matter based on compilation. For FRD, the Director, Office of Classification, or any appropriate DoD official (as specified in DoD Instruction 5210.02 or subsequent instructions) may classify or upgrade the matter based on compilation. Matter that is classified as RD, FRD, or TFNI based on compilation is never portion marked.
