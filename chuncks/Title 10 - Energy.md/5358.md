(d)The ISFSI or MRS must be designed to provide means to limit to levels as low as is reasonably achievable the release of radioactive materials in effluents during normal operations; and control the release of radioactive materials under accident conditions. Analyses must be made to show that releases to the general environment during normal operations and anticipated occurrences will be within the exposure limit given in ยง 72.104. Analyses of design basis accidents must be made to show that releases to the general environment will be within the exposure limits given in ยง 72.106. Systems designed to monitor the release of radioactive materials must have means for calibration and testing their operability.
