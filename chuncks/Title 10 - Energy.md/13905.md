###### § 603.315 Advantages of a fixed-support TIA.

In situations where the use of a fixed-support TIA is permissible (see §§ 603.305 and 603.310), its use may encourage some commercial firms' participation in the RD&D. With a fixed-support TIA, the contracting officer can eliminate or reduce some post-award requirements that sometimes are cited as disincentives for those firms to participate. For example, a fixed-support TIA need not:

(a) Specify minimum standards for the recipient's financial management system;

(b) Specify cost principles or standards stating the types of costs the recipient may charge to the project;

(c) Provide for financial audits by Federal auditors or independent public accountants of the recipient's books and records;

(d) Set minimum standards for the recipient's purchasing system; or

(e) Require the recipient to prepare financial reports for submission to the Federal Government.
