Obtain the fractional bin hours for the cooling season, n/N, from Table 19 to this appendix. For each temperature bin where the unit operates at an intermediate compressor speed, determine the energy efficiency ratio EER(T) using,().

For each unit, determine the coefficients A, B, and C by conducting the following calculations once:

Calculate SEER using Eq. 4.1-1, where q(Tj)/N and e(Tj)/N are evaluated as specified in the applicable subsection.
