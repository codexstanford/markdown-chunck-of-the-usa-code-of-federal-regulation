###### Physical inventory.

(f)The licensee shall:

(1) Except as required by part 75 of this Chapter, perform a physical inventory at least every six calendar months and within 45 days after the start of the ending inventory:

(i) Calculate the inventory difference (ID); estimate the standard error of the inventory difference (SEID); and investigate and report any SEID estimate of 0.1 percent or more of active inventory, and any ID that exceeds both three times SEID and 200 grams of plutonium or uranium-233, or 300 grams of uranium-235 contained in high enriched uranium.

(ii) If required to perform an investigation pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, evaluate the significance of the inventory difference relative to expected performance as determined from an analysis of an appropriate sequence of historical inventory differences;

(iii) Investigate and report, by an appropriate method listed in ยง 74.6, to the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, any difference that exceeds three times the standard deviation determined from the sequential analysis;

(iv) Perform a reinventory if directed to do so by the Commission; and

(v) Reconcile and adjust the plant and subsidiary book records to the results of the physical inventory.

(2) Implement policies, practices, and procedures designed to ensure the quality of physical inventories. These must include:

(i) Development of procedures for tamper-safing of containers or vaults containing SSNM not in process that include adequate controls to assure the validity of assigned SSNM values;

(ii) Maintenance of records of the quantities of SSNM added to and removed from process;

(iii) Requirements for signed documentation of all SSNM transfers between areas with different custodial responsibility that reflect all quantities of SSNM transferred;

(iv) Means for control of and accounting for internal transfer documents;

(v) Cutoff procedures for transfers and processing so that all quantities of SSNM are inventoried and none are inventoried more than once;

(vi) Cutoff procedures for records and reports so that all transfers for the inventory and material balance interval and no others are included in the records;

(vii) Inventory procedures for sealed sources and containers or vaults containing SSNM that assure reliable identification and quantification of contained SSNM;

(viii) Inventory procedures for in-process SSNM that provide for measurement of quantities not previously measured for element and isotope, as appropriate, and remeasurement of material previously measured but whose validity has not been assured by tamper-safing or equivalent protection; and

(ix) Written instructions for conducting physical inventories that detail assignments, responsibilities, and preparation for and performance of an inventory.
