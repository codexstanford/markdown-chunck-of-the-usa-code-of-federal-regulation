###### Fuel Price Computation.

(C)(1) The delivered price of the proposed fuel to be burned (FPB) must reflect the real escalation rate of the proposed fuel, and must be computed with Equation EQ II-3.

(2) When planning to use more than one fuel in the proposed unit(s), the petitioner must use Equation II-1 and Equation II-3 to calculate the annual fuel price of each fuel to be used. The petitioner then must estimate the proportion of each fuel to be burned annually over the useful life of the unit(s). With these proportions and the respective annual fuel prices for each fuel, the petitioner must compute an annual weighted average fuel price. The methodology used to calculate the weighted average fuel price must follow standard statistical procedures and be fully documented within the petition.
