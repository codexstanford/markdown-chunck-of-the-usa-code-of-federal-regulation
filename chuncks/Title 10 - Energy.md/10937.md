(b) Section 6.6-

2.1 Air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h. Determine the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) and heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) (as applicable) in accordance with ANSI/AHRI 210/240-2008. Sections 3 to 6 of this appendix provide additional instructions for determining SEER and HSPF.

2.2 Air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h. Determine the SEER and HSPF (as applicable) in accordance with ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010.

Sections 3 through 6 of this appendix provide additional instructions for determining SEER and HSPF.
