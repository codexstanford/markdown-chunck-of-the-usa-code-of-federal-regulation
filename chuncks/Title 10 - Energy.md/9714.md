####### Showerheads.

(p)The maximum water use allowed for any showerheads manufactured after January 1, 1994, shall be 2.5 gallons per minute (9.5 liters per minute) when measured at a flowing pressure of 80 pounds per square inch gage (552 kilopascals). When used as a component of any such showerhead, the flow-restricting insert shall be mechanically retained at the point of manufacture such that a force of 8.0 pounds force (36 Newtons) or more is required to remove the flow-restricting insert, except that this requirement shall not apply to showerheads for which removal of the flow-restricting insert would cause water to leak significantly from areas other than the spray face.
