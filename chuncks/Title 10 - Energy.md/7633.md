###### ยง 429.43 Commercial heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC) equipment (excluding air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour cooling capacity).
####### i.e.,

(B) When certifying compliance with an IEER standard, the following must be certified for each tested combination as required under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section: The integrated energy efficiency ratio (IEER) in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh); the coefficient of performance (COP); the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); the rated heating capacity (Btu/h); whether the represented values are for a non-ducted, ducted, or SDHV tested combination, or for a mixed representation of any two of the tested combinations; and the outdoor unit(s) and indoor units identified in the tested combination. The following must be certified for each basic model: the type(s) of heating used (electric, gas, hydronic, none); and the refrigerant used to determine the represented values.

(ix) Computer room air-conditioners: The net sensible cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), the net cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), the configuration (upflow/downflow), economizer presence (yes or no), condenser medium (air, water, or glycol-cooled), sensible coefficient of performance (SCOP), and rated airflow in standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM).

(x) Water source heat pumps (other than variable refrigerant flow): The energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), the coefficient of performance (COP), the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), and the type(s) of heating used by the basic model (e.g., electric, gas, hydronic, none).

(3) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following additional equipment-specific information:

(i) Whether the basic model is engineered-to-order; and

(ii) For any basic model rated with an AEDM, whether the manufacturer elects the witness test option for verification testing. (See ยง 429.70(c)(5)(iii) for options). However, the manufacturer may not select more than 10% of AEDM-rated basic models.
