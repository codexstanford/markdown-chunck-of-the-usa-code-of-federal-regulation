3.1.1. If the unit does not have an integral pump purge functionality, then turn off the outlet water valve and water pump at this time.

7.3.1.2. If the unit has an integral pump purge functionality, allow the pump purge operation to continue. After the pump purge operation is complete, immediately turn off the outlet water valve and water pump and continue recording the required parameters for the remainder of the test.

7.3.2.1. For units with pump purge functionality, record the initial heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T), and ambient room temperature when the main burner(s) cut-out or the fuel supply is turned off. After the pump purge operation is complete, record the time as t = 0 and the initial electricity meter reading. Continue to monitor and record the heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T) and time elapsed from the start of the test, and the electricity consumption as per the requirements in section 3.9.2 of this appendix.
