#### PART 300 - VOLUNTARY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM: GENERAL GUIDELINES
##### ยง 300.9 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
###### Revisions to reports submitted under the guidelines.

(b)(1) Once EIA has accepted a report under this part, it may be revised by the reporting entity only under the circumstances specified in this paragraph and related provisions of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see ยง 300.13). In general:

(i) Revised reports may be submitted to correct errors that have a significant effect on previously estimated emissions or emission reductions; and

(ii) Emission inventories may be revised in order to create a consistent time series based on improvements in the emission estimation or measurement techniques used.

(2) Reporting entities must provide the corrected or improved data to EIA, together with an explanation of the significance of the change and its justification.

(3) If a change in calculation methods (for inventories or reductions) is made for a particular year, the reporting entity must, if feasible, revise its base value to assure methodological consistency with the reporting year value.
