####### Average Power Calculation.

6.1.For all tests in the on, standby-active, low, and standby-passive modes, the average power shall be calculated using one of the following two methods:

6.1.1. Record the accumulated energy (E) in kilo-watt hours (kWh) consumed over the time period specified for each test (T). The average power consumption is calculated as P= E/T.

6.1.2. Record the average power consumption (P) by sampling the power at a rate of at least 1 sample per second and computing the arithmetic mean of all samples over the time period specified for each test (T).

The resulting average power consumption value for each mode of operation shall be rounded according to the accurary requirements specified in section 3.3.3 of this section.

7. Test Measurements.
