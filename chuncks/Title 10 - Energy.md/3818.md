##### Calculation of Reflood Rate for Pressurized Water Reactors.

3.The refilling of the reactor vessel and the time and rate of reflooding of the core shall be calculated by an acceptable model that takes into consideration the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of the core and of the reactor system. The primary system coolant pumps shall be assumed to have locked impellers if this assumption leads to the maximum calculated cladding temperature; otherwise the pump rotor shall be assumed to be running free. The ratio of the total fluid flow at the core exit plane to the total liquid flow at the core inlet plane (carryover fraction) shall be used to determine the core exit flow and shall be determined in accordance with applicable experimental data (for example, "PWR FLECHT (Full Length Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer) Final Report," Westinghouse Report WCAP-7665, April 1971; "PWR Full Length Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer (FLECHT) Group I Test Report," Westinghouse Report WCAP-7435, January 1970; "PWR FLECHT (Full Length Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer) Group II Test Report," Westinghouse Report WCAP-7544, September 1970; "PWR FLECHT Final Report Supplement," Westinghouse Report WCAP-7931, October 1972).

The effects on reflooding rate of the compressed gas in the accumulator which is discharged following accumulator water discharge shall also be taken into account.
