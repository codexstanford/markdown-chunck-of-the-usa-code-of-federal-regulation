####### Per-cycle machine electrical energy consumption for all maximum, average, and minimum test load sizes.

4.1.5Calculate the total per-cycle machine electrical energy consumption for the maximum water fill level, ME, the average water fill level, ME, and the minimum water fill level, ME, expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle and defined as:

Em, Em, and Em, are reported electrical energy consumption values, in kilowatt-hours per cycle, at maximum, average, and minimum test loads, respectively, for the Extra-Hot Wash/Cold Rinse cycle, as measured in sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 of this appendix.

Eh, Eh, and Eh, are reported electrical energy consumption values, in kilowatt-hours per cycle, at maximum, average, and minimum test loads, respectively, for the Hot Wash/Cold Rinse cycle, as measured in sections 3.4.1 through 3.4.3 of this appendix.

Ew, Ew, and Ew, are reported electrical energy consumption values, in kilowatt-hours per cycle, at maximum, average, and minimum test loads, respectively, for the Warm Wash/Cold Rinse cycle, as measured in sections 3.5.1 through 3.5.3 of this appendix.

Eww, Eww, and Eww, are reported electrical energy consumption values, in kilowatt-hours per cycle, at maximum, average, and minimum test loads, respectively, for the Warm Wash/Warm Rinse cycle, as measured in sections 3.6.1 through 3.6.3 of this appendix.

Ec, Ec, and Ec, are reported electrical energy consumption values, in kilowatt-hours per cycle, at maximum, average, and minimum test loads, respectively, for the Cold Wash/Cold Rinse cycle, as measured in sections 3.7.1 through 3.7.3 of this appendix.

TUF, TUF, TUF, TUF, and TUFare defined in Table 4.1.1 of this appendix.
