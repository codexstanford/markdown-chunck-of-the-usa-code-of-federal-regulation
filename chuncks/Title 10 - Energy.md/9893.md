###### Auxiliary Electric Power Measurement.

3.1.3Allow the auxiliary electrical system of a gas or oil vented heater to operate for at least five minutes before recording the maximum auxiliary electric power measurement from the wattmeter. Record the maximum electric power (P) expressed in kilowatts. For vented heaters with modulating controls, the recorded (P) shall be maximum measured electric power multiplied by the following factor (R). For two stage controls, R = 1.3. For step modulating controls, R = 1.4 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is greater than or equal to 0.7, R = 1.7 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.7 and greater than or equal to 0.5, and R = 2.2 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.5.
