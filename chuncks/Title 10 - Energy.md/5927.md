###### Inventory control and physical inventories.

(c)The licensee shall:

(1) Provide unique identification for each item on inventory and maintain inventory records showing the identity, location, and quantity of SNM for these items;

(2) Document all transfers of SNM between designated internal control areas within the licensee's site;

(3) Maintain and follow procedures for tamper-safing of containers or vaults containing SNM, if tamper-safe seals are to be used for assuring the validity of prior measurements, which include control of access to, and distribution of, unused seals and to records showing the date and time of seal application;

(4) Maintain and follow procedures for confirming the validity of prior measurements associated with unencapsulated and unsealed items on ending inventory;

(5) Maintain and follow physical inventory procedures to assure that:

(i) The quantity of SNM associated with each item on ending inventory is a measured value;

(ii) Each item on ending inventory is listed and identified to assure that all items are listed and no item is listed more than once;

(iii) Cutoff procedures for transfers and processing are established so that all quantities are inventoried and none are inventoried more than once;

(iv) Cutoff procedures for records and reports are established so that only transfers for the inventory and material balance interval are included in the records for the material balance period in question;

(v) Upon completion of the physical inventory, all book and inventory records, for total plant and individual internal control areas, are reconciled with and adjusted to the results of the physical inventory; and

(vi) Measurements will be performed for element and isotope content on all quantities of SNM not previously measured.

(6) Conduct physical inventories according to written instructions for each physical inventory which:

(i) Assign inventory duties and responsibilities;

(ii) Specify the extent to which each internal control area and process is to be shut down, cleaned out, and/or remain static;

(iii) Identify the basis for accepting previously made measurements and their limits of error; and

(iv) Designate measurements to be made for physical inventory purposes and the procedures for making these measurements.

(7) Conduct physical inventories of all possessed SNM for each plant at intervals not to exceed 9 calendar months; and

(8) Within 60 calendar days after the start of each physical inventory required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section:

(i) Calculate, for the material balance period terminated by the physical inventory, the inventory difference (ID) and its associated standard error of inventory difference (SEID) for both element and isotope;

(ii) Reconcile and adjust the book record of quantity of element and isotope content, as appropriate, to the results of the physical inventory; and

(iii) Investigate and report to the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, any occurrence of SEID exceeding 0.125 percent of active inventory, and any occurrence of ID exceeding both three times SEID and 200 grams of plutonium or uranium-233 or 300 grams of uranium-235 contained in high enriched uranium, or 9000 grams of uranium-235 contained in low enriched uranium. The report shall include a statement of the probable reasons for the excessive inventory difference and the corrective actions taken or planned.
