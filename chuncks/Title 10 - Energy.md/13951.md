###### ยง 603.605 General policy.

The general policy for an expenditure-based TIA is to avoid requirements that would force participants to use different financial management, property management, and purchasing systems than they currently use for:

(a) Expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts and assistance awards in general, if they receive them; or

(b) Commercial business, if they have no expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts and assistance awards.
