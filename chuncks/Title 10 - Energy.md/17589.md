###### Advanced Readiness Standard

(ARS) means a qualification standard that includes the requirements of the Fixed Post Readiness Standard (FPRS), but also requires the completion of a one mile run with a maximum qualifying time of 8 minutes 30 seconds, a 40-yard dash from the prone position in 8.0 seconds or less, and any other measure of physical readiness necessary to perform site-specific essential functions as prescribed by site management and approved by the respective program office. This standard applies to SPOs who staff security posts that normally require extensive tactical movement on foot or are assigned Special Response Team duties.
