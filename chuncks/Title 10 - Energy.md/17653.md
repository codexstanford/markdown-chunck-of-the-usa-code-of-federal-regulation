###### SRT member essential functions.

(g)The essential functions of an SRT member include those of an ARS SPO. The primary role of SRTs is the recapture, pursuit, and/or recovery of Department security interests. In addition, an SRT member must be trained to resolve incidents that require activities and force options that exceed the capabilities of other site PF members, as determined by site-specific analysis. An SRT SPO also must:

(1) Successfully complete a Departmental advanced tactical qualification course designed to provide the minimum level of skills and knowledge needed to completely perform all tasks associated with SRT job responsibilities;

(2) Have knowledge and skills to provide additional protection capability as demanded by the particular targets, threats, and vulnerabilities existing at their assigned Departmental facility;

(3) Be able to operate special weapons, tactical vehicles, and other equipment necessary to protect a particular facility or to effectively engage an adversary with advanced capabilities; and

(4) Possess the ability to act successfully as a member of an aggressive and readily mobile response team as dictated by site-specific vulnerability assessments, using force options and tactical response team techniques necessary for recapture and recovery operations directed against an adversary and to support site-specific protection strategies.
