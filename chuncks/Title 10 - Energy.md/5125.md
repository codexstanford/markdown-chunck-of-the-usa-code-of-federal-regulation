##### ยง 71.65 Additional requirements.
###### ยง 71.75 Qualification of special form radioactive material.

(a) Special form radioactive materials must meet the test requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Each solid radioactive material or capsule specimen to be tested must be manufactured or fabricated so that it is representative of the actual solid material or capsule that will be transported, with the proposed radioactive content duplicated as closely as practicable. Any differences between the material to be transported and the test material, such as the use of non-radioactive contents, must be taken into account in determining whether the test requirements have been met. In addition:

(1) A different specimen may be used for each of the tests;

(2) The specimen may not break or shatter when subjected to the impact, percussion, or bending tests;

(3) The specimen may not melt or disperse when subjected to the heat test;

(4) After each test, leaktightness or indispersibility of the specimen must be determined by a method no less sensitive than the leaching assessment procedure prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. For a capsule resistant to corrosion by water, and which has an internal void volume greater than 0.1 milliliter, an alternative to the leaching assessment is a demonstration of leaktightness of x 10torr-liter/s (1.3 x x 10atm-cm/s) based on air at 25 &#xB0;C (77 &#xB0;F) and one atmosphere differential pressure for solid radioactive content, or x 10torr-liter/s (1.3 x x 10atm-cm/s) for liquid or gaseous radioactive content; and

(5) A specimen that comprises or simulates radioactive material contained in a sealed capsule need not be subjected to the leaktightness procedure specified in this section, provided it is alternatively subjected to any of the tests prescribed in ISO 9978:1992(E), "Radiation protection-Sealed radioactive sources-Leakage test methods" (incorporated by reference, see ยง 71.70).
