###### ยง 429.70 Alternative methods for determining energy efficiency and energy use.
####### Alternative efficiency determination method (AEDM) for dedicated-purpose pool pump motors subject to requirements in subpart Z of part 431 of this subchapter,Criteria an AEDM must satisfy.

(k)-(1)A manufacturer is not permitted to apply an AEDM to a basic model of dedicated-purpose pool pump motors, to determine its efficiency pursuant to this section unless:

(i) The AEDM is derived from a mathematical model that estimates the energy efficiency characteristics and losses of the basic model as measured by the applicable DOE test procedure and accurately represents the mechanical and electrical characteristics of that basic model;

(ii) The AEDM is based on engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, or other analytic evaluation of actual performance data; and

(iii) The manufacturer has validated the AEDM in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section with basic models that meet the current Federal energy conservation standards (if any).
