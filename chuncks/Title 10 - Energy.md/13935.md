####### ยง 603.635 Cost principles for nonprofit participants.

So as not to force financial system changes for any nonprofit participant, an expenditure-based TIA will provide that costs to be charged to the RD&D project by any nonprofit participant must be determined to be allowable in accordance with:

(a) OMB Circular A-87, if the participant is a State or local governmental organization;

(b) OMB Circular A-21, if the participant is an institution of higher education;

(c) 45 CFR Part 74, Appendix E, if the participant is a hospital; or

(d) OMB Circular A-122, if the participant is any other type of nonprofit organization (the cost principles in 48 CFR parts 31 and 231 are to be used by any nonprofit organization that is identified in Circular A-122 as being subject to those cost principles).
