####### Measuring Critical Parameter Variation During Adjustment Period.

5.2.1.2.1When adjusting critical parameters to reduce cooling capacity, critical parameter variation must be calculated each time the critical parameters are adjusted, using the following equations:

(a) First, use equation 5.2-1 to calculate the absolute parameter percent difference () between each adjusted critical parameter and the value for that parameter certified in the STI.

(b) Next, use equation 5.2-2 to this section to determine the accrued points for each critical parameter:

(c) Finally, use equation 5.2-3 to this section to calculate the root-sum-squared (RSS) Points Total across all critical parameters.
