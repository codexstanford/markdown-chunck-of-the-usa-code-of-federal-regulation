4.1.2.Measure the heat contribution from infiltration air for single-duct portable air conditioners and dual-duct portable air conditioners that draw at least part of the condenser air from the conditioned space. Calculate the heat contribution from infiltration air for single-duct and dual-duct portable air conditioners for both cooling mode outdoor test conditions, as described in this section. Calculate the dry air mass flow rate of infiltration air according to the following equations:

For dual-duct portable air conditioners:

For single-duct and dual-duct portable air conditioners, calculate the sensible component of infiltration air heat contribution according to:

Calculate the latent heat contribution of the infiltration air according to:

The total heat contribution of the infiltration air is the sum of the sensible and latent heat:

Q= Q+ Q

Q= Q+ Q
