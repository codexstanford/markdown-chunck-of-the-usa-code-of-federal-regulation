###### ยง 429.43 Commercial heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC) equipment (excluding air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour cooling capacity).
####### i.e.,

(B) When certifying compliance with an IEER standard, the following must be certified for each tested combination as required under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section: The integrated energy efficiency ratio (IEER) in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)); the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); whether the represented values are for a non-ducted, ducted, or SDHV tested combination, or for a mixed representation of any two of the tested combinations; and the outdoor unit(s) and indoor units identified in the tested combination. The following must be certified for each basic model: the type(s) of heating used (electric, gas, hydronic, none); and the refrigerant used to determine the represented values.

(viii) Variable refrigerant flow multi-split heat pumps (other than air-cooled with rated cooling capacity less than 65,000 btu/h):

(A) When certifying compliance with an EER standard: The energy efficiency ratio (EER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), the coefficient of performance (COP), rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), and the type(s) of heating used by the basic model (e.g., electric, gas, hydronic, none).
