###### e.g.,

(b)(1) The collector shall pay careful attention to the donor during the entire collection process, except as provided in ยง 26.109(b)(1), to observe any conduct that indicates an attempt to subvert the testing process (tampering with a specimen; having a substitute urine specimen in plain view; attempting to bring an adulterant, urine substitute, heating element, and/or temperature measurement device into the room, stall, or private area used for urination). If any such conduct is detected, the collector shall document a description of the conduct on the Federal CCF or through another documentation method consistent with the collection procedures of the licensee or other entity, and contact FFD program management to determine whether a directly observed collection is required, as described in ยง 26.115.
