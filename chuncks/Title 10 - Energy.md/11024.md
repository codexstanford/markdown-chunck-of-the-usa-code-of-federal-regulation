####### 5.,Thermal Efficiency Calculation.

5.Thermal efficiency must be calculated using data from the 30-minute thermal efficiency test. Calculate thermal efficiency, E, using the following equation:

6.1. If no settings on the water heater have changed and the water heater has not been turned off since a previously run thermal efficiency or standby loss test, skip to section 6.3 of this appendix. Otherwise, conduct the soak-in period according to section 6.2 of this appendix.
