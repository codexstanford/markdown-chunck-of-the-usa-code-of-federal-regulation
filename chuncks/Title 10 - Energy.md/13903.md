###### ยง 603.305 Use of a fixed-support TIA.

The contracting officer may use a fixed-support TIA if:

(a) The agreement is to support or stimulate RD&D with outcomes that are well defined, observable, and verifiable;

(b) The resources required to achieve the outcomes can be estimated well enough to ensure the desired level of cost sharing (see example in ยง 603.560(b)); and

(c) The agreement does not require a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing. In cases where the agreement does require a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing, a fixed-support TIA is not practicable because the agreement has to specify cost principles or standards for costs that may be charged to the project; require the recipient to track the costs of the project; and provide access for audit to allow verification of the recipient's compliance with the mandatory cost sharing. A fixed-support TIA may not be used if there is:

(1) A requirement (e.g., in statute or policy determination) for a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing; or

(2) The contracting officer, in consultation with the program official, otherwise elects to include in the TIA a requirement for a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing.
