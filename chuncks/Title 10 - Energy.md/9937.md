###### Weighted-average steady-state efficiency.

4.2.4

4.2.4.1 For manually controlled heaters with various input rates the weighted average steady-state efficiency (&#x3B7;), is determined as follows:

(1) at 50 percent of the maximum fuel input rate as measured in either section 3.1.1 of this appendix for manually controlled gas vented heaters or section 3.1.2 of this appendix for manually controlled oil vented heaters, or

(2) at the minimum fuel input rate as measured in either section 3.1.1 of this appendix for manually controlled gas vented heaters or section 3.1.2 of this appendix for manually controlled oil vented heaters if the design of the heater is such that the +/-5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel input rate cannot be set, provided this minimum rate is no greater thanof the maximum input rate of the heater.

4.2.4.2 For manually controlled heater with one single firing rate the weighted average steady-state efficiency is the steady-state efficiency measured at the single firing rate.
