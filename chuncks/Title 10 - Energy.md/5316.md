#### Subpart D - Records, Reports, Inspections, and Enforcement
##### ยง 72.75 Reporting requirements for specific events and conditions.
###### Preparation and submission of written reports.

(g)Each licensee who makes an initial notification required by paragraphs (b)(1), (c)(1), (c)(2), or (d)(1) of this section shall also submit a written follow-up report to the Commission within 60 days of the initial notification. Written reports prepared pursuant to other regulations may be submitted to fulfill this requirement if the reports contain all the necessary information and the appropriate distribution is made. These written reports must be of sufficient quality to permit legible reproduction and optical scanning and must be submitted to the NRC in accordance with ยง 72.4. These reports must include the following information:

(1) A brief abstract describing the major occurrences during the event, including all component or system failures that contributed to the event and significant corrective action taken or planned to prevent recurrence;

(2) A clear, specific, narrative description of the event that occurred so that knowledgeable readers conversant with the design of an ISFSI or MRS, but not familiar with the details of a particular facility, can understand the complete event. The narrative description must include the following specific information as appropriate for the particular event:

(i) The ISFSI or MRS operating conditions before the event;

(ii) The status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and that contributed to the event;

(iii) The dates and approximate times of occurrences;

(iv) The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known;

(v) The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known;

(vi) A list of systems or secondary functions that were also affected for failures of components with multiple functions;

(vii) For wet spent fuel storage systems only, after the failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed time from the discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service;

(viii) The method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error;

(ix) For each human performance related root cause, the licensee shall discuss the cause(s) and circumstances;

(x) For wet spent fuel storage systems only, any automatically and manually initiated safety system responses;

(xi) The manufacturer and model number (or other identification) of each component that failed during the event; and

(xii) The quantities and chemical and physical forms of the spent fuel, HLW, or reactor-related GTCC waste involved in the event;

(3) An assessment of the safety consequences and implications of the event. This assessment must include the availability of other systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event;

(4) A description of any corrective actions planned as a result of the event, including those to reduce the probability of similar events occurring in the future;

(5) Reference to any previous similar events at the same facility that are known to the licensee;

(6) The name and telephone number of a person within the licensee's organization who is knowledgeable about the event and can provide additional information concerning the event and the facility's characteristics; and

(7) The extent of exposure of individuals to radiation or to radioactive materials without identification of individuals by name.
