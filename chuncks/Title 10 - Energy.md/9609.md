####### PLF,k,X,T

X(T)= BL(T)/Q(T).= 1 - C(= 2) * [1 -()]

If the H1Ctest described in section 3.6.3 and Table 13 of this appendix is not conducted, set C(k=2) equal to the default value specified in section 3.8.1 of this appendix.

Determine the low temperature cut-out factor, Î´(T), using Equation 4.2.3-3.

a. Minimum Compressor Speed. For units other than variable-speed non-communicating coil-only heat pumps, evaluate the space heating capacity, Q(T), and electrical power consumption, E(T), of the heat pump when operating at minimum compressor speed and outdoor temperature Tusing:
