####### Certification reports.

(f)This paragraph specifies the information that must be included in a certification report.

(1) The requirements of ยง 429.12; and

(2) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), for each individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split-systems, including outdoor units with no match and "tested combinations" for multi-split, multi-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems), a certification report must include the following public equipment-specific information:

(i) Commercial package air conditioning equipment that is air-cooled with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-Phase): The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), and the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(ii) Commercial package heating equipment that is air-cooled with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-Phase): The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), the heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), and the rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(iii) Variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners that are air-cooled with rated cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-Phase): The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)) and rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(iv) Variable refrigerant flow multi-split heat pumps that are air-cooled with rated cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-Phase): The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh), the heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh), and rated cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).

(3) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), for each individual model/combination (including outdoor units with no match and "tested combinations"), a certification report must include supplemental information submitted in PDF format. The equipment-specific, supplemental information must include any additional testing and testing set up instructions (e.g., charging instructions) for the basic model; identification of all special features that were included in rating the basic model; and all other information (e.g., operational codes or component settings) necessary to operate the basic model under the required conditions specified by the relevant test procedure. A manufacturer may also include with a certification report other supplementary items in PDF format (e.g., manuals) for DOE consideration in performing testing under subpart C of this part. The equipment-specific, supplemental information must include at least the following:

(i) Air cooled commercial package air conditioning equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-phase): The nominal cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); rated airflow in standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) for each fan coil; rated static pressure in inches of water; refrigeration charging instructions (e.g., refrigerant charge, superheat and/or subcooling temperatures); frequency or control set points for variable speed components (e.g., compressors, VFDs); required dip switch/control settings for step or variable components; a statement whether the model will operate at test conditions without manufacturer programming; any additional testing instructions, if applicable; if a variety of motors/drive kits are offered for sale as options in the basic model to account for varying installation requirements, the model number and specifications of the motor (to include efficiency, horsepower, open/closed, and number of poles) and the drive kit, including settings, associated with that specific motor that were used to determine the certified rating; and which, if any, special features were included in rating the basic model.

(ii) Commercial package heating equipment that is air-cooled with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-phase): The nominal cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); rated heating capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); rated airflow in standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) for each fan coil; rated static pressure in inches of water; refrigeration charging instructions (e.g., refrigerant charge, superheat and/or subcooling temperatures); frequency or control set points for variable speed components (e.g., compressors, VFDs); required dip switch/control settings for step or variable components; a statement whether the model will operate at test conditions without manufacturer programming; any additional testing instructions, if applicable; if a variety of motors/drive kits are offered for sale as options in the basic model to account for varying installation requirements, the model number and specifications of the motor (to include efficiency, horsepower, open/closed, and number of poles) and the drive kit, including settings, associated with that specific motor that were used to determine the certified rating; and which, if any, special features were included in rating the basic model.

(iii) Variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners that are air-cooled with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-Phase): The nominal cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); outdoor unit(s) and indoor units identified in the tested combination; components needed for heat recovery, if applicable; rated airflow in standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) for each indoor unit; rated static pressure in inches of water; compressor frequency set points; required dip switch/control settings for step or variable components; a statement whether the model will operate at test conditions without manufacturer programming; any additional testing instructions, if applicable; if a variety of motors/drive kits are offered for sale as options in the basic model to account for varying installation requirements, the model number and specifications of the motor (to include efficiency, horsepower, open/closed, and number of poles) and the drive kit, including settings, associated with that specific motor that were used to determine the certified rating; and which, if any, special features were included in rating the basic model. Additionally, upon DOE request, the manufacturer must provide a layout of the system set-up for testing including charging instructions consistent with the installation manual.

(iv) Variable refrigerant flow multi-split heat pumps that are air-cooled with a rated cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (3-Phase): The nominal cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); rated heating capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h); outdoor unit(s) and indoor units identified in the tested combination; components needed for heat recovery, if applicable; rated airflow in standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) for each indoor unit; rated static pressure in inches of water; compressor frequency set points; required dip switch/control settings for step or variable components; a statement whether the model will operate at test conditions without manufacturer programming; any additional testing instructions, if applicable; if a variety of motors/drive kits are offered for sale as options in the basic model to account for varying installation requirements, the model number and specifications of the motor (to include efficiency, horsepower, open/closed, and number of poles) and the drive kit, including settings, associated with that specific motor that were used to determine the certified rating; and which, if any, special features were included in rating the basic model.
