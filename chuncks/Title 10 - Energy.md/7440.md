(i)A basic model (model of outdoor unit) may only be certified as compliant with a regional standard if all individual combinations within that basic model meet the regional standard for which it is certified, including the coil-only combination as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as applicable. A model of outdoor unit that is certified below a regional standard can only be rated and certified as compliant with a regional standard if the model of outdoor unit has a unique model number and has been certified as a different basic model for distribution in each region, where the basic model(s) certified as compliant with a regional standard meet the requirements of the first sentence. An ICM cannot certify an individual combination with a rating that is compliant with a regional standard if the individual combination includes a model of outdoor unit that the OUM has certified with a rating that is not compliant with a regional standard. Conversely, an ICM cannot certify an individual combination with a rating that is not compliant with a regional standard if the individual combination includes a model of outdoor unit that an OUM has certified with a rating that is compliant with a regional standard.
