##### draft environmental impact statements - production and utilization facilities
###### ยง 51.76 Draft environmental impact statement - limited work authorization.
####### Limited work authorization for a site where an environmental impact statement was prepared, but the facility construction was not completed.

(e)If the limited work authorization is for activities to be conducted at a site for which the Commission has previously prepared an environmental impact statement for the construction and operation of a nuclear power plant, and a construction permit was issued but construction of the plant was not completed, then the draft environmental impact statement shall incorporate by reference the earlier environmental impact statement. The draft environmental impact statement must be limited to a consideration of whether there is significant new information with respect to the environmental impacts of construction, relevant to the activities to be conducted under the limited work authority, so that the conclusion of the referenced environmental impact statement on the impacts of construction would, when analyzed in accordance with ยง 51.71, lead to the conclusion that the limited work authorization should not be issued or should be issued with appropriate conditions.
