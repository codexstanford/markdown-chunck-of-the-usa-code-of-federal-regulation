####### Small, non-small-electric-motor electric motor ("SNEM")

means an electric motor that:

(a) Is not a small electric motor, as defined ยง 431.442 and is not a dedicated-purpose pool pump motor as defined at ยง 431.483;

(b) Is rated for continuous duty (MG 1) operation or for duty type S1 (IEC);

(c) Operates on polyphase or single-phase alternating current 60-hertz (Hz) sinusoidal line power; or is used with an inverter that operates on polyphase or single-phase alternating current 60-hertz (Hz) sinusoidal line power;

(d) Is rated for 600 volts or less;

(e) Is a single-speed induction motor capable of operating without an inverter or is an inverter-only electric motor;

(f) Produces a rated motor horsepower greater than or equal to 0.25 horsepower (0.18 kW); and

(g) Is built in the following frame sizes: any two-, or three-digit NEMA frame size (or IEC metric equivalent) if the motor operates on single-phase power; any two-, or three-digit NEMA frame size (or IEC metric equivalent) if the motor operates on polyphase power, and has a rated motor horsepower less than 1 horsepower (0.75 kW); or a two-digit NEMA frame size (or IEC metric equivalent), if the motor operates on polyphase power, has a rated motor horsepower equal to or greater than 1 horsepower (0.75 kW), and is not an enclosed 56 NEMA frame size (or IEC metric equivalent).
