####### ยง 603.670 Flow down audit requirements to subrecipients.

(a) In accordance with ยง 603.610, an expenditure-based TIA must require participants to flow down the same audit requirements to a subrecipient that would apply if the subrecipient were a participant.

(b) For example, a for-profit participant that is audited by the DCAA:

(1) Would flow down to a university subrecipient the Single Audit Act requirements that apply to a university participant;

(2) Could enter into a subaward allowing a for-profit participant, under the circumstances described in ยง 603.650(a), to use an IPA to do its audits.

(c) This policy applies to subawards for substantive performance of portions of the RD&D project supported by the TIA, and not to participants' purchases of goods or services needed to carry out the RD&D.
