####### Verification of the distance between the ceiling and lowest point of fan blades.

(2)DOE will measure the distance between the ceiling and lowest point of the fan blades and round the measurement pursuant to the test requirements of 10 CFR part 430 of this chapter for each unit tested. DOE will consider the represented distance valid only if the rounded measurement(s) (either the measured value for a single unit, or the mean of the measured values for a multiple unit sample, rounded to the nearest quarter inch) are the same as the represented distance.

(i) If DOE determines that the represented distance is valid, that distance will be used as the basis for determining the product class.

(ii) If DOE determines that the represented distance is invalid, DOE will use the rounded measured distance(s) as the basis for determining the product class.
