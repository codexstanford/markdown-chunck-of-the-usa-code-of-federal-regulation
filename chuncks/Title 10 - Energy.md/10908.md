####### e.g.,

(ii) When testing other than full-capacity cooling operation using the full-load indoor airflow rate (full-load heating), the full-load indoor airflow rate must be within +/- 3 percent of the certified-rated full-load cooling airflow (without regard to the resulting external static pressure), unless the unit is designed to operate at a different airflow for cooling and heating mode. If necessary, a test facility setup may be made in order to maintain airflow within the required tolerance; however, no adjustments to the unit under test may be made.
