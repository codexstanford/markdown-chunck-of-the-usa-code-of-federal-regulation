####### Steady-State Conditions.

7.1.1.The following conditions must be met at consecutive readings taken at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, for which measurements are taken at 10-minute intervals) to verify the water heater has achieved steady-state operation during the steady-state verification period prior to conducting the standby loss test.

7.1.1.1. The water flow rate must be maintained within +/- 0.25 gallons per minute (gpm) of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period;

7.1.1.2. Fuel input rate must be maintained within +/- 2 percent of the rated input certified by the manufacturer;

7.1.1.3. The supply water temperature (T) (or inlet water temperature (T) if a recirculating loop is used) must be maintained within +/- 0.50 &#xB0;F of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period; and

7.1.1.4. The rise between the supply (or inlet if a recirculating loop is used) and outlet water temperatures must be maintained within +/- 0.50 &#xB0;F of its initial value taken at the start of the steady-state verification period for units with rated input less than 500,000 Btu/h, and maintained within +/- 1.00 &#xB0;F of its initial value for units with rated input greater than or equal to 500,000 Btu/h.
