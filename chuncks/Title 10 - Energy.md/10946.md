####### Cycle Stability Requirements.

4.Conduct three complete compressor OFF/ON cycles. Calculate the degradation coefficient CD for each complete cycle. If all three CD values are within 0.02 of the average CD then stability has been achieved, and the highest CD value of these three shall be used. If stability has not been achieved, conduct additional cycles, up to a maximum of eight cycles total, until stability has been achieved between three consecutive cycles. Once stability has been achieved, use the highest CD value of the three consecutive cycles that establish stability. If stability has not been achieved after eight cycles, use the highest CD from cycle one through cycle eight, or the default CD, whichever is lower.
