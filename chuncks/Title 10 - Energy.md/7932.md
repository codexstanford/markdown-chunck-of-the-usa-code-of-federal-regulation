##### Subpart B - Certification
###### ยง 429.70 Alternative methods for determining energy efficiency and energy use.
####### i.e.,

(B) Have a certification body recognized under ยง 429.73 certify the results of the AEDM as accurately representing the basic model's average full-load efficiency. The simulated full-load efficiency for each basic model must be greater than or equal to 90 percent of the certified full-load losses (0.90 x certified full-load losses &#x2264; simulated full-load losses).

(ii) Each manufacturer that has used an AEDM under this section must have available for inspection by the Department of Energy records showing:

(A) The method or methods used to develop the AEDM;

(B) The mathematical model, the engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, and other analytic evaluation of performance data on which the AEDM is based;

(C) Complete test data, product information, and related information that the manufacturer has generated or acquired pursuant to paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section; and

(D) The calculations used to determine the simulated full-load efficiency of each basic model to which the AEDM was applied.

(iii) If requested by the Department, the manufacturer must:

(A) Conduct simulations to predict the performance of particular basic models of electric motors specified by the Department;

(B) Provide analyses of previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer; and/or

(C) Conduct testing of basic models selected by the Department.
