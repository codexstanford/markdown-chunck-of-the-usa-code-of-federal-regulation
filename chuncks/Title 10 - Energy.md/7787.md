(2)In lieu of testing, the represented value of nominal full-load efficiency for a basic model of electric motor must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of ยง 429.70(j) and the provisions of this section, where:

(i) The average full-load efficiency of any basic model used to validate an AEDM must be calculated under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; and

(ii) The represented value is the nominal full-load efficiency of a basic model of electric motor and is to be used in marketing materials and all public representations, as the certified value of efficiency, and on the nameplate. (See ยง 431.31(a) of this subchapter) Determine the nominal full-load efficiency by selecting a value from the "Nominal Full-Load Efficiency" table in appendix B to subpart B of this part, that is no greater than the simulated full-load efficiency predicted by the AEDM for the basic model.
