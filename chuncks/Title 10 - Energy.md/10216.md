###### Inactive and off mode.

4.3Establish the testing conditions set forth in section 3.2 of this appendix, ensuring that the dehumidifier does not enter active mode during the test. For dehumidifiers that take some time to enter a stable state from a higher power state, as discussed in Section 5, Paragraph 5.1, Note 1 of IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 430.3), allow sufficient time for the dehumidifier to reach the lower power state before proceeding with the test measurement. Follow the test procedure specified in Section 5, Paragraph 5.3.2 of IEC 62301 for testing in each possible mode as described in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 of this appendix.

4.3.1 If the dehumidifier has an inactive mode, as defined in section 2.10 of this appendix, but not an off mode, as defined in section 2.11 of this appendix, measure and record the average inactive mode power of the dehumidifier, P, in watts.

4.3.2 If the dehumidifier has an off mode, as defined in section 2.11 of this appendix, measure and record the average off mode power of the dehumidifier, P, in watts.
