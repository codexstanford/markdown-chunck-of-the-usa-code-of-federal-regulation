###### Oil burner.

7.5Adjust the burners of oil-fired boilers to give a COreading specified in the I&O manual and an hourly Btu input within +/-2% of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating as specified in the I&O manual and as measured at maximum input rate during steady-state performance test as described in section 8 of this appendix. Smoke in the flue may not exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156-09 (R2018). Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance test at the value specified in the I&O manual. Do not allow draft fluctuations exceeding 0.005 in. water. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test are described in section 6 of this appendix and shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
