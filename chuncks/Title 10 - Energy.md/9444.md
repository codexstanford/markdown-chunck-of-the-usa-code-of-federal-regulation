Heat pumps having heat comfort controllers, when set to maintain a typical minimum air delivery temperature, will cause the heat pump condenser to operate less because of a greater contribution from the resistive elements. With a conventional heat pump, resistive heating is only initiated if the heat pump condenser cannot meet the building load (is delayed until a second stage call from the indoor thermostat). With a heat comfort controller, resistive heating can occur even though the heat pump condenser has adequate capacity to meet the building load (both on during a first stage call from the indoor thermostat). As a result, the outdoor temperature where the heat pump compressor no longer cycles (starts to run continuously), will be lower than if the heat pump did not have the heat comfort controller.

Calculate the space heating capacity and electrical power of the heat pump without the heat comfort controller being active as specified in section 4.2.1 of this appendix (Equations 4.2.1-4 and 4.2.1-5) for each outdoor bin temperature, T, that is listed in Table 20. Denote these capacities and electrical powers by using the subscript "hp" instead of "h." Calculate the mass flow rate (expressed in pounds-mass of dry air per hour) and the specific heat of the indoor air (expressed in Btu/lbm&#xB7; &#xB0;F) from the results of the H1 test using:

Evaluate e(T/N), RH(T)/N, X(T), PLF, and Î´(T) as specified in section 4.2.1 of this appendix. For each bin calculation, use the space heating capacity and electrical power from Case 1 or Case 2, whichever applies.
