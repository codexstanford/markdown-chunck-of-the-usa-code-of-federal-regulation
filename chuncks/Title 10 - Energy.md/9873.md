###### 2.3.3 Other test gas.

For vented heaters fueled by other test gases, use test gases with characteristics as described in Table 3 of Section 5.2 of ANSI Z21.86-2016. Use gases with a measured higher heating value within +/-5 percent of the values specified in Table 3 of Section 5.2 of ANSI Z21.86-2016. Determine the actual higher heating value of the gas used in the test with an error no greater than one percent.
