####### Miscellaneous refrigeration products.

(d)The total refrigerated volume of a miscellaneous refrigeration product basic model may be determined by performing a calculation of the volume based upon computer-aided design (CAD) models of the basic model in lieu of physical measurements of a production unit of the basic model. Any value of total adjusted volume and value of total refrigerated volume of a basic model reported to DOE in a certification of compliance in accordance with ยง 429.61(b)(2) must be calculated using the CAD-derived volume(s) and the applicable provisions in the test procedures in part 430 of this chapter for measuring volume. The calculated value must be within two percent, or 0.5 cubic feet (0.2 cubic feet for products with total refrigerated volume less than 7.75 cubic feet (220 liters)), whichever is greater, of the volume of a production unit of the basic model measured in accordance with the applicable test procedure in part 430 of this chapter.
