##### ยง 905.16 What are the requirements for the minimum investment report alternative?
###### Multi-state entities.

(c)For those customers with service territories lying in more than one State or Tribal jurisdiction, and where at least one of the States or Tribal jurisdictions has a mandated minimum investment requirement, to meet this alternative customers must use the highest requirement from the State or Tribe within the customer's service territory and additionally apply it to all members in those States or Tribal jurisdictions in which there is no requirement. Alternatively, if each State or Tribe has a requirement, customers may satisfy Western's requirement by reporting on compliance with each applicable minimum investment requirement. Western will work with multi-state entities to ensure the most effective, and least burdensome, compliance mechanism.
