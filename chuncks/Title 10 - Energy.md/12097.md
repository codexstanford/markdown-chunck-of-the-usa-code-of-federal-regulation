####### Electric Water Heaters.

404.1.4In applications where water temperatures not greater than 145 &#xB0;F are required, an economic evaluation shall be made on the potential benefit of using an electric heat pump water heater(s) instead of an electric resistance water heater(s). The analysis shall compare the extra installed costs of the heat pump unit with the benefits in reduced energy costs (less increased maintenance costs) over the estimated service life of the heat pump water heater. Exceptions are as follows: Electric water heaters used in conjunction with site-recovered or site-solar energy sources that provide 50% or more of the water heating load or off-peak heating with thermal storage.
