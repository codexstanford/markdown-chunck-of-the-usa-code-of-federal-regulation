####### Modulating gas burner adjustment at reduced input rate.

7.3For gas-fired furnaces equipped with modulating-type controls, adjust the controls to operate the unit at the nameplate minimum input rate. If the modulating control is of a non-automatic type, adjust the control to the setting recommended in the I&O manual. In the absence of such recommendation, the midpoint setting of the non-automatic control shall be used as the setting for determining the reduced fuel input rate. Start the furnace by turning the safety control valve to the "ON" position.
