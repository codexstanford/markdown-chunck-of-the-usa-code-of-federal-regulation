###### Potentially adverse conditions.

(c)(1) Indications that the site contains naturally occurring materials, whether or not actually identified in such form that (i) economic extraction is potentially feasible during the foreseeable future or (ii) such materials have a greater gross value, net value, or commercial potential than the average for other areas of similar size that are representative of, and located in, the geologic setting.

(2) Evidence of subsurface mining or extraction for resources within the site if it could affect waste containment or isolation.

(3) Evidence of drilling within the site for any purpose other than repository-site evaluation to a depth sufficient to affect waste containment and isolation.

(4) Evidence of a significant concentration of any naturally occurring material that is not widely available from other sources.

(5) Potential for foreseeable human activities-such as ground-water withdrawal, extensive irrigation, subsurface injection of fluids, underground pumped storage, military activities, or the construction of large-scale surface-water impoundments-that could adversely change portions of the ground-water flow system important to waste isolation.
