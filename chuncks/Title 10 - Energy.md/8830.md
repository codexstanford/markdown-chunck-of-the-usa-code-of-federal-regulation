####### Hourly Standby Losses.

6.3.3The energy consumed as part of the standby loss test of the 24-hour simulated-use test, Q, is computed as:

Q= cumulative energy consumption of the water heater from the start of the 24-hour simulated-use test to the time at which the maximum mean tank temperature is attained starting five minutes after the recovery following the end of the first draw cluster, Btu (kJ).

Q= cumulative energy consumption of the water heater from the start of the 24-hour simulated-use test to the minute prior to the start of the draw following the end of the first draw cluster or the minute prior to a recovery occurring at the start of the draw following the end of the first draw cluster, Btu (kJ).

The hourly standby energy losses are computed as:

The standby heat loss coefficient for the tank is computed as:
