(a) The first sample size () for enforcement testing must be four or more units, except as provided by ยง 429.57(e)(1)(i).

(b) Compute the mean of the measured energy performance (x) for all tests as follows:

(c) Compute the standard deviation (s) of the measured energy performance from the ntests as follows:

(d) Compute the standard error (s) of the measured energy performance from the ntests as follows:

(e)(1) Compute the upper control limit (UCL) and lower control limit (LCL) for the mean of the first sample using the applicable DOE energy efficiency standard (EES) as the desired mean and a probability level of 95 percent (two-tailed test) as follows:

(2) For an energy efficiency or water efficiency standard, compare the mean of the first sample (x) with the upper and lower control limits (UCLand LCL) to determine one of the following:

(i) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)

(ii) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or greater than the upper control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)

(iii) If the sample mean is equal to or greater than the lower control limit but less than the upper control limit, then no determination of compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second sample size is determined by Step (e)(3).

(3) For an energy efficiency or water efficiency standard, determine the second sample size (n) as follows:
