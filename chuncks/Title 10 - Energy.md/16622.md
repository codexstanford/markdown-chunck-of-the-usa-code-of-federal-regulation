(ii)This system of records is being exempted pursuant to subsection (j)(2) of the Act to enable the Office of Counterintelligence to carry out its duties and responsibilities as they pertain to its law enforcement function. The system is exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2), and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(8), (f), and (g) of the Act. The system is exempt from these provisions for the following reasons: Notifying an individual at the individual's request of the existence of records in an investigative file pertaining to such individual, or granting access to an investigative file could interfere with investigative and enforcement proceedings and with co-defendants' right to a fair trial; disclose the identity of confidential sources and reveal confidential information supplied by these sources; and disclose investigative techniques and procedures.
