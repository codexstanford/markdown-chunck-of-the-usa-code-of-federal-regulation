515.1 Receptacle loads and profiles are default assumptions. The same assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption as were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.

515.2 Receptacle loads include all general service loads that are typical in a building. These loads exclude any process electrical usage and HVAC primary or auxiliary electrical usage. Table 515.2, Receptacle Power Densities, establishes the density, in W/ft, to be used for each building type. The receptacle energy profiles shall be the same as the lighting energy profiles in Table 513.2.b. This profile establishes the percentage of the receptacle load that is switched on by hour of the day and by building type.
