2.2.5For tests of non-condensing boilers, maintain ambient room temperature between 65 &#xB0;F and 100 &#xB0;F at all times during the "Warm-up Period" and "Test Period" (as described in Section C4 of Appendix C of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015) as indicated by 1-minute interval data pursuant to Table 2.2 of this appendix. For tests of condensing boilers, maintain ambient room temperature between 65 &#xB0;F and 85 &#xB0;F at all times during the "Warm-up Period" and "Test Period" (as described in Section C4 of Appendix C of ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015) as indicated by 1-minute interval data pursuant to Table 2.2 of this appendix. The ambient room temperature may not differ by more than +/- 5 &#xB0;F from the average ambient room temperature during the entire "Test Period" at any reading. Measure the room ambient temperature within 6 feet of the front of the unit at mid height. The test air temperature, measured at the air inlet of the commercial packaged boiler, must be within +/- 5 &#xB0;F of the room ambient temperature when recorded at the 1-minute interval defined by Table 2.2 of this appendix.
