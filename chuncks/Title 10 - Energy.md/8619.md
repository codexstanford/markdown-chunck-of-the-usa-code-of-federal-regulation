####### Non-soil-sensing and soil-sensing dishwashers to be tested at a nominal inlet temperature of 50 &#xB0;F, 120 &#xB0;F, or 140 &#xB0;F.

2.3

The test load and soiling requirements for all non-soil-sensing and soil-sensing dishwashers shall be the same as those requirements specified in section 2.6.3 of AHAM DW-1-2020 for soil-sensing dishwashers. Additionally, both non-soil-sensing and soil-sensing compact dishwashers that have a capacity of less than four place settings shall be tested at the rated capacity of the dishwasher and the test load shall be soiled as follows at each soil load:

(a) Heavy soil load: soil two-thirds of the place settings, excluding flatware and serving pieces (rounded up to the nearest integer) or one place setting, whichever is greater;

(b) Medium soil load: soil one-quarter of the place settings, excluding flatware and serving pieces (rounded up to the nearest integer) or one place setting, whichever is smaller;

(c) Light soil load: soil one-quarter of the place settings, excluding flatware and serving pieces (rounded up to the nearest integer) or one place setting, whichever is smaller, using half the quantity of soils specified for one place setting.
