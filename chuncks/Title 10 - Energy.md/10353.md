##### Appendix Z to Subpart B of Part 430 - Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of External Power Supplies
###### i.e.,

(C) If the UUT can only sustain one output current at any of the output busses, test it at the loading condition that allows for the maximum output power on that bus (the highest output current possible at the highest output voltage on that bus).

(vii) Power consumption calculation. The power consumption of Loading Condition 5 (no-load) is equal to the active AC input power at that loading condition.

(2) Off-mode Measurement-If the UUT incorporates manual on-off switches, place the UUT in off-mode, and measure and record its power consumption at Loading Condition 5 in Table 4 of this section. The measurement of the off-mode energy consumption must conform to the requirements specified in section (6)(b)(1) of this appendix, except that all manual on-off switches must be placed in the "off" position for the off-mode measurement. The UUT is considered stable if, over 5 minutes with samples taken at least once every second, the AC input power does not drift from the maximum value observed by more than 1 percent or 50 milliwatts, whichever is greater. Measure the off-mode power consumption of a multiple-voltage adaptive external power supply twice-once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest.
