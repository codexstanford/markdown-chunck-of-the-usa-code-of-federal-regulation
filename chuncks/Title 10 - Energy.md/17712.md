###### SO maintenance training.

(2)Each SO must successfully complete an annual course of maintenance training to maintain the minimum level of competency required for the successful performance of tasks and essential functions associated with SO job responsibilities. The type and intensity of training must be based on a site-specific JA or METL. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SO's placement in a remedial training program. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SO with the necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the job analysis. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SO status.
