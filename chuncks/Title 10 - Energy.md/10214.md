###### Refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.

4.1.2Establish the testing conditions set forth in section 3.1.2 of this appendix. Measure the energy consumption, E, expressed in kWh, in accordance with the test requirements specified in Section 7, "Capacity Test and Energy Consumption Test," of ANSI/AHAM DH-1 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 430.3), except that: (1) individual readings of the standard test conditions at the air entering the process air inlet duct and the reactivation air inlet must be maintained within 73 &#xB0;F +/- 2.0 &#xB0;F dry-bulb temperature and 60 percent +/- 5 percent relative humidity and the arithmetic average of the inlet test conditions over the test period shall be maintained within 73 &#xB0;F +/- 0.5 &#xB0;F dry-bulb temperature and 60 percent +/- 2 percent relative humidity; (2) the instructions for psychrometer placement do not apply; (3) the data recorded must include dry-bulb temperatures, relative humidities, static pressures, velocity pressures in each duct, volumetric air flow rates, and the number of samples in the test period; (4) the condensate collected during the test need not be weighed; and (5) the calculations in Section 7.2.2, "Energy Factor Calculation," of ANSI/AHAM DH-1 need not be performed. To perform the calculations in Section 7.1.7, "Calculation of Test Results," of ANSI/AHAM DH-1: (1) replace "Condensate collected (lb)" and "m", with the weight of condensate removed, W, as calculated in section 5.6 of this appendix; and (2) use the recorded relative humidities rather than the tables in section 4.1.1 of this appendix to determine average relative humidity.
