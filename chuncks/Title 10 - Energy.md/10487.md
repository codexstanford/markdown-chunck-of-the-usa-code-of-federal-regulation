###### Fuel input.

8.1For gas units, measure and record the steady-state gas input rate in Btu/h, including pilot gas, corrected to standard conditions of 60 &#xB0;F and 30 in. Hg. Use measured values of gas temperature and pressure at the meter and barometric pressure to correct the metered gas flow rate to the above standard conditions. For oil units, measure and record the steady-state fuel input rate. For maximum input rate, the measured burner input rate shall be within +/-2% of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating (Q) specified by the manufacturer. For modulating furnaces and boilers operating at reduced input rate, the measured reduced heat input rate (Q) shall be recorded. At the discretion of the one testing, the hourly Btu nameplate minimum input rating specified by the manufacturer may be used in the calculations in place of Qif the measured rate is within +/-2% of the nameplate rating.
