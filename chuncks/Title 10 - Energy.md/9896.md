###### Measurement of the effectiveness of electro-mechanical stack dampers.

3.4For vented heaters equipped with electro-mechanical stack dampers, measure the cross sectional area of the stack (A), the net area of the damper plate (A), and the angle that the damper plate makes when closed with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the stack (&#x3A9;). The net area of the damper plate means the area of the damper plate minus the area of any holes through the damper plate.
