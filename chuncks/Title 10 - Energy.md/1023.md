#### Requirements for Special Nuclear Material Access Authorization
##### ยง 11.15 Application for special nuclear material access authorization.
###### i.e.,

(1) Each application for a special nuclear material access authorization, renewal, or change in level must be accompanied by a remittance, payable to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is equal to the NRC material access authorization fee. This fee must be determined using the following formula: the DCSA investigation billing rates on the day of NRC receipt of the application + the NRC processing fee = the NRC material access authorization fee. The NRC processing fee is determined by multiplying the DCSA investigation billing rate on the day of NRC receipt of the application by 90.2 percent (DCSA rate x 90.2 percent).
