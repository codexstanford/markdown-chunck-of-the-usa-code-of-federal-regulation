(m)See the note at the beginning of appendix M and M1 to determine the appropriate test method. Determine all values discussed in this section using a single appendix.

(1) Determine cooling capacity from the steady-state wet-coil test (A or ATest), as described in section 3.2 of appendix M or M1 to this subpart, and rounded off to the nearest

(i) To the nearest 50 Btu/h if cooling capacity is less than 20,000 Btu/h;

(ii) To the nearest 100 Btu/h if cooling capacity is greater than or equal to 20,000 Btu/h but less than 38,000 Btu/h; and

(iii) To the nearest 250 Btu/h if cooling capacity is greater than or equal to 38,000 Btu/h and less than 65,000 Btu/h.

(2) Determine seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) as described in section 4.1 of appendix M to this subpart or seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 (SEER2) as described in section 4.1 of appendix M1 to this subpart, and round off to the nearest 0.025 Btu/W-h.

(3) Determine energy efficiency ratio (EER) as described in section 4.6 of appendix M or M1 to this subpart, and round off to the nearest 0.025 Btu/W-h. The EER from the A or Atest, whichever applies, when tested in accordance with appendix M1 to this subpart, is referred to as EER2.

(4) Determine heating seasonal performance factors (HSPF) as described in section 4.2 of appendix M to this subpart or heating seasonal performance factors 2 (HSPF2) as described in section 4.2 of appendix M1 to this subpart, and round off to the nearest 0.025 Btu/W-h.

(5) Determine average off mode power consumption as described in section 4.3 of appendix M or M1 to this subpart, and round off to the nearest 0.5 W.

(6) Determine all other measures of energy efficiency or consumption or other useful measures of performance using appendix M or M1 of this subpart.
