This appendix contains the test requirements to measure the energy performance of a room air conditioner.

2.1 "Active mode" means a mode in which the room air conditioner is connected to a mains power source, has been activated and is performing any of the following functions: Cooling or heating the conditioned space, or circulating air through activation of its fan or blower, with or without energizing active air-cleaning components or devices such as ultra-violet (UV) radiation, electrostatic filters, ozone generators, or other air-cleaning devices.

2.2 "ANSI/AHAM RAC-1" means the test standard published jointly by the American National Standards Institute and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, titled "Energy Measurement Test Procedure for Room Air Conditioners," Standard RAC-1-2020 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

2.3 "ANSI/ASHRAE 16" means the test standard published jointly by the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers titled "Method of Testing for Rating Room Air Conditioners and Packaged Terminal Air Conditioners," Standard 16-2016 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

2.4 "ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1" means the test standard published jointly by the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers titled "Standard Method for Temperature Measurement," Standard 41.1-2013 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

2.5 "ASHRAE 41.2-1987 (RA 1992)" means the test standard published jointly by the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers titled "Standard Methods for Laboratory Airflow Measurement," Standard 41.2-1987 (RA 1992) (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

2.6 "ASHRAE 41.3-2014" means the test standard published jointly by the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers titled "Standard Methods for Pressure Measurement," Standard 41.3-2014 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

2.7 "ASHRAE 41.6-2014" means the test standard published jointly by the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers titled "Standard Method for Humidity Measurement," Standard 41.6-2014 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

2.8 "ASHRAE 41.11-2014" means the test standard published jointly by the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers titled "Standard Methods for Power Measurement," Standard 41.11-2014 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

2.9 "Combined energy efficiency ratio" means the energy efficiency of a room air conditioner in British thermal units per watt-hour (Btu/Wh) and determined in section 5.2.2 of this appendix for single-speed room air conditioners and section 5.3.12 of this appendix for variable-speed room air conditioners.

2.10 "Cooling capacity" means the amount of cooling, in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), provided to a conditioned space, measured under the specified conditions and determined in section 4.1 of this appendix.

2.11 "Cooling mode" means an active mode in which a room air conditioner has activated the main cooling function according to the thermostat or temperature sensor signal or switch (including remote control).

2.12 "Full compressor speed (full)" means the compressor speed at which the unit operates at full load test conditions, when using user settings with a unit thermostat setpoint of 75 &#xB0;F to achieve maximum cooling capacity, according to the instructions in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 16-2016.

2.17 "Off mode" means a mode in which a room air conditioner is connected to a mains power source and is not providing any active or standby mode function and where the mode may persist for an indefinite time, including an indicator that only shows the user that the product is in the off position.

2.18 "Single-speed room air conditioner" means a type of room air conditioner that cannot automatically adjust the compressor speed based on detected conditions.

2.19 "Standby mode" means any product mode where the unit is connected to a mains power source and offers one or more of the following user-oriented or protective functions which may persist for an indefinite time:
