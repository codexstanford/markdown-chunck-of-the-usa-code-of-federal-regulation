() The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

(iii) For packaged terminal air conditioners and packaged terminal heat pumps, the represented value of cooling capacity shall be the average of the capacities measured for the sample selected as described in (a)(1)(ii) of this section, rounded to the nearest 100 Btu/h.

(iv) For air-cooled commercial package air-conditioning and heating equipment, the represented value of cooling capacity must be a self-declared value corresponding to the nearest appropriate Btu/h multiple according to Table 4 of ANSI/AHRI 340/360-2007 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 429.4) that is no less than 95 percent of the mean of the capacities measured for the units in the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
