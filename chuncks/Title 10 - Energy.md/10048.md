4.2.1

4.2.1.1 Season and stabilize lamps in accordance with Sections (and corresponding subsections) 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 of IES LM-9-20 and with IES LM-54-20.

4.2.1.2 Measure the initial input power (in watts).

4.2.1.3 Measure initial lumen output in accordance with Section 7.0 (and corresponding subsections) of IES LM-9-20 and with IES LM-78-20.

4.2.1.4 Calculate initial lamp efficacy by dividing the measured initial lumen output by the measured initial input power.

4.2.1.5 Calculate CRI as specified in Section 7.6 of IES LM-9-20 and CIE 13.3. Conduct the required spectroradiometric measurement and characterization in accordance with the methods set forth in IES LM-58-20.

4.2.1.6 Calculate CCT as specified in Section 7.6 of IES LM-9-20 and CIE 15:2018. Conduct the required spectroradiometric measurement and characterization in accordance with the methods set forth in IES LM-58-20.
