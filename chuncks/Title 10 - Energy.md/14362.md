### PART 708 - DOE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE PROTECTION PROGRAM
#### Subpart C - Investigation, Hearing, and Decision Process
##### § 708.42 Extension of deadlines.

The Secretary of Energy (or the Secretary's designee) may approve the extension of any deadline established by this part, and the OHA Director may approve the extension of any deadline under §§ 708.22 through 708.34 of this subpart (relating to the investigation, hearing, and OHA appeal process).
