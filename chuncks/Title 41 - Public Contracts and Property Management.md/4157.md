######## ยง 102-118.230 What if my agency creates or eliminates a field office approved to prepare transportation documents?

Your agency must tell the GSA Transportation Audits Division whenever it approves a new or existing agency field office to prepare transportation documents or when an agency field office is no longer authorized to do so. This notice must show the name, field office location of the bureau or office, and the date on which your agency granted or canceled its authority to schedule payments for transportation service.
