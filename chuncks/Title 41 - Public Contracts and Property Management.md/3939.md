####### ยง 102-85.195 Does GSA provide special services?

Yes, GSA provides special services on a cost-reimbursable basis:

(a) In GSA-controlled space, GSA may provide for special services that cannot be separated from the building or space costs (inseparable services, such as utilities, which are not individually metered). GSA's estimate of the special service cost is the basis for the bill amount. The bill amount for separable special services is either based on a previously agreed upon fixed price or the actual cost, including a fee for GSA's services.

(b) GSA can also provide special services to other Federal agencies in agency-controlled and operated space on a cost-reimbursable basis.
