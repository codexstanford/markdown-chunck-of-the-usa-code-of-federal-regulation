####### ยง 301-11.32 May I be reimbursed for an advance room deposit in situations where a lodging facility requires the payment of a deposit, prior to the beginning of my scheduled official travel?

Yes, your agency may reimburse you for an advance room deposit, when such a deposit is required by the lodging facility to secure a room reservation, prior to the beginning of your scheduled official travel. However, if you are reimbursed the advance room deposit, but fail to perform the scheduled official travel for reasons not acceptable to your agency, resulting in forfeit of the deposit, you are indebted to the Government for that amount and must repay it in a manner prescribed by your agency.
