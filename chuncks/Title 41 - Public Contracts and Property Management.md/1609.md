####### ยง 101-26.501-7 Sale of vehicles.

GSA will not solicit trade-in bids when purchasing new motor vehicles for replacement purposes because experience has shown that suppliers (manufacturers) are unwilling to accept used vehicles in part payment for new ones. Accordingly, used vehicles that are being replaced will be disposed of by sale as set forth in Part 101-46.
