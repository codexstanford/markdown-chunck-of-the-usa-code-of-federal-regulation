(b) When an employee on temporary duty is authorized to travel by Government motor vehicle, and in the interest of the Government, is scheduled to depart before the beginning of regular working hours, or if there will be a significant savings in time, a Government motor vehicle may be issued at the close of the preceding working day. Such authorizations must be submitted to the fleet manager to ensure proper use of motor vehicles during non-duty hours.

This use of a Government motor vehicle is not regarded as prohibited by 31 U.S.C. 1344 (25 Comp. Gen. 844(1946)).
