####### ยง 301-70.105 May we prohibit an employee from using a POV on official travel?

No, but if the employee elects to use a POV instead of an alternative form of transportation you authorize, you must:

(a) Limit reimbursement to the constructive cost of the authorized method of transportation, which is the sum of travel and transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred had the employee traveled by the method of transportation deemed to be most advantageous to the Government. The calculation will necessarily involve assumptions. Examples of related expenses that could be considered constructive costs include, but are not limited to, taxi and TNC fares, baggage fees, rental car costs, tolls, ferry fees, and parking charges; and

(b) Charge leave for any duty hours that are missed as a result of travel by POV.
