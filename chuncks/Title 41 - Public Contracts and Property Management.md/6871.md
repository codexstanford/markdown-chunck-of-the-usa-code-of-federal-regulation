####### ยง 302-12.116 What must we consider in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method?
######## Effect on the obligation of funds.

(c)You must obligate funds for a relocation in the fiscal year in which the purchase order is awarded under the contract. Under the fixed fee contracting method, the amount of the relocation services fee is fixed and you have a basis for determining the amount of funds to obligate. Under the cost-reimbursable contracting method, you must obligate funds based on an estimate of the costs that will be incurred. When opting for cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, should establish a reliable method of computing fund obligation estimates.
