####### ยง 101-25.108 Multiyear subscriptions for publications.

Subscriptions for periodicals, newspapers, and other publications for which it is known in advance that a continuing requirement exists should be for multiple years rather than for a single year where such method is advantageous for the purpose of economy or otherwise. Where various bureaus or offices in the same agency are subscribing to the same publication, consideration shall be given to consolidating these requirements, to the extent practical, on an agency-wide basis and on a multiyear basis. Payment covering issues to be delivered during the entire subscription period may be made in advance from currently available appropriations (31 U.S.C. 530a).
