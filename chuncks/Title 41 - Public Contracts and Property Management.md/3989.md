####### ยง 102-117.50 What are the advantages and disadvantages of contracting directly with a TSP under the FAR?

(a) The FAR is an advantage to use when:

(1) You ship consistent volumes in consistent traffic lanes;

(2) You have sufficient time to follow FAR contracting procedures; and

(3) Your contract office is able to handle the requirement.

(b) The FAR may be a disadvantage when you:

(1) Cannot prepare and execute a FAR contract within your time frame;

(2) Have recurring shipments between designated places, but do not expect sufficient volume to obtain favorable rates; or

(3) Do not have the manpower to monitor quality control and administer a contract.
