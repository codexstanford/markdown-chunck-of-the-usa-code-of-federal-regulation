######## ยง 301-10.122 What must I do with compensation an airline gives me if it denies me a seat on a plane?

If you are performing official travel and a carrier denies you a confirmed reserved seat on a plane, you must give your agency any payment you receive for liquidated damages. You must ensure the carrier shows the "Treasurer of the United States" as payee on the compensation check and then forward the payment to the appropriate agency official.
