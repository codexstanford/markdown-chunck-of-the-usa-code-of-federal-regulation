####### § 301-70.102 What governing policies must we establish for authorization and payment of transportation expenses?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) Who will determine what method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government;

(b) Who will approve any of the following:

(1) Use of other than coach class accommodations under § 301-10.103 of this chapter;

(2) Use of a special-reduced fare or reduced group or charter fare;

(3) Use of an extra-fare train service under § 301-10.160;

(4) Use of ship service;

(5) Use of a foreign ship;

(6) Use of a foreign air carrier;

(c) When you will:

(1) Require the use of a Government vehicle;

(2) Allow the use of a Government vehicle; and

(3) Prohibit the use of a Government vehicle;

(d) When you consider the use of a POV advantageous to the Government, such as travel to and from common carrier terminals or to the TDY location. When determining whether the use of a POV to a TDY location is the most advantageous method of transportation, you must consider the total cost of using a POV as compared to the total cost of using a rental vehicle, including rental costs, fuel, taxes, parking (at a common carrier terminal-not to exceed the cost of taxi or transportation network company fare, etc.), and any other relevant costs;

(e) Procedures for claiming POV reimbursement;

(f) Procedures for allowing the use of a special conveyance (e.g., taxis, TNCs, innovative mobility technology companies, or commercially rented vehicles), taking into account the requirements of § 301-10.450;

(g) What procedures an employee must follow when he/she travels by an indirect route or interrupts travel by a direct route;

(h) Whether to reimburse the full amount of transportation costs and in conjunction with TDY or only the amount by which transportation costs exceed the employee's normal costs for transportation between:

(1) Office or duty point and another place of business;

(2) Places of business; or

(3) Residence and place of business other than office or duty point;

(i) Develop and issue internal guidance on what specific mission criteria justify use of other than coach class under § 301-10.103(a)(9) and the use of other than the least expensive compact car available under § 301-10.450(c). The justification criteria shall be noted on the traveler's authorization.

(j) Develop and publish internal guidance regarding what constitutes a rest period upon arrival at a temporary duty location; and

(k) Develop and publish internal guidance regarding when coach class seating upgrade fees will be authorized as advantageous to the Government and reimbursed (see § 301-10.121).
