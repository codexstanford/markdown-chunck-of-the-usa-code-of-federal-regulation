####### ยง 302-3.502 What factors should we consider in determining whether to authorize a TCS for a long-term assignment?
######## Employee concerns.

(c)The long-term assignment of an employee away from his/her official station and immediate family may negatively affect the employee's morale and job performance. Such negative effects may be alleviated by authorizing a TCS so the employee can transport his/her immediate family and/or household goods at Government expense to the location where he/she will perform the long-term assignment. You should consider the effects of a long-term temporary duty travel assignment on an employee when deciding whether to authorize a TCS.
