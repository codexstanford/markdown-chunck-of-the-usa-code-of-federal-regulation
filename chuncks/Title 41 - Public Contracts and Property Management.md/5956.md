####### ยง 300-70.103 Are there any exceptions to the first class and business class reporting requirement?

Yes. You must not report data that is protected from public disclosure by statute or Executive Order, such as classified data or data otherwise withheld from the public in response to written requests under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). In these cases, you are required to report the following aggregate information:

(a) Aggregate number of authorized first class and business class trips that are protected from disclosure;

(b) Total cost of actual first class and business class fares paid that exceeded the coach class fare; and

(c) Total cost of coach class fares that would have been paid for the same travel.
