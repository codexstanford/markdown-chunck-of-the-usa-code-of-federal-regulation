####### ยง 302-6.201 How do I determine the amount of my TQSE lump sum payment?

(a) For yourself, multiply the number of days your agency authorizes TQSE by .75 times the maximum per diem rate (that is, lodging plus meals and incidental expenses) prescribed by ยง 301-11.6 of this subtitle for the locality at the old or new official station or combination thereof, wherever TQ will be occupied. Please note that for non-foreign OCONUS, the Department of Defense Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowances Committee establishes the per diem rate, and for foreign OCONUS, the Department of State establishes the per diem rates.

(b) For each member of your immediate family, multiply the same number of days by .25 times the same per diem rate, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Your lump sum payment will be the sum of the calculations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
