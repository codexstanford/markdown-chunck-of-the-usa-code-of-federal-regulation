######## Informal investigation.

(a)GSA investigates complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement. As part of the initial investigation, GSA uses informal factfinding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and the recipient, to establish the fact and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. GSA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency. GSA puts any agreement in writing and has it signed by the parties and an authorized official designated by the Administrator or the Director, Office of Organization and Personnel. The settlement may not affect the operation of any other enforcement efforts of GSA, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints that may involve the recipient. The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.
