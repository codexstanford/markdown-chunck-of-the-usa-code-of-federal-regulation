####### General,Transactions of $10,000 or under.,Provided,

(a)-(1)Contracts and subcontracts not exceeding $10,000, other than Government bills of lading, and other than contracts and subcontracts with depositories of Federal funds in any amount and with financial institutions which are issuing and paying agents for U.S. savings bonds and savings notes, are exempt from the requirements of the equal opportunity clause. In determining the applicability of this exemption to any federally assisted construction contract, or subcontract thereunder, the amount of such contract or subcontract rather than the amount of the Federal financial assistance shall govern. No agency, contractor, or subcontractor shall procure supplies or services in a manner so as to avoid applicability of the equal opportunity clause:that where a contractor has contracts or subcontracts with the Government in any 12-month period which have an aggregate total value (or can reasonably be expected to have an aggregate total value) exceeding $10,000, the $10,000 or under exemption does not apply, and the contracts are subject to the order and the regulations issued pursuant thereto regardless of whether any single contract exceeds $10,000.
