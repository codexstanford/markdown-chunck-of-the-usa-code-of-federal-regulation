######## ยง 102-38.170 May we sell Federal personal property to anyone?

Generally, you may sell Federal personal property to anyone of legal age. However, certain persons or entities are debarred or suspended from purchasing Federal property. You must not enter into a contract with such a person or entity unless your agency head or designee responsible for the disposal action determines that there is a compelling reason for such an action.
