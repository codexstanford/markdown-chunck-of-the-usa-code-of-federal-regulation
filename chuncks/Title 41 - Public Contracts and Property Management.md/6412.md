####### § 302-2.3 What determines my entitlements and allowances for relocation?

Your entitlements and allowances for relocation are determined by the regulatory provisions that are in effect at the time you report for duty at your new official station. However, this does not change the requirement that all aspects of a relocation must be completed by the time specified in §§ 302-2.8 through 302-2.12.
