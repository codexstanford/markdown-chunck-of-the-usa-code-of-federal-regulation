(ii) An intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless; or

(iii) The reasons why the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use to assist the homeless. The reasons given must be different than those listed as suitability criteria in ยง 102-75.1185.

(2) In the case of excess property that had previously been reported to GSA-

(i) A statement that there is no compelling Federal need for the property and that, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or
