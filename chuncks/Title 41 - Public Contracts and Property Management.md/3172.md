####### ยง 102-72.85 What are the requirements for obtaining a disposal of real property delegation of authority from GSA?

While disposal delegations to Executive agencies are infrequent, GSA may delegate authority to them based on situations involving certain low-value properties and when they can demonstrate that they have the technical expertise to perform the disposition functions.
