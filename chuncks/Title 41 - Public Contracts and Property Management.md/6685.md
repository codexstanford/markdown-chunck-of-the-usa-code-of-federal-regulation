####### § 302-7.401 What method of transportation and payment should we authorize for shipment and temporary storage of HHG?
######## Commuted rate system.

(b)

(1) Under the commuted rate system, the employee assumes total responsibility for arranging and paying for the expenses of all aspects of shipping the employee's HHG, including PBP&E, if any. These expenses may include but are not limited to: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage. This method is used only for shipments within CONUS, and only where it is less costly to the Government than actual expense. The employee may arrange for shipment with a commercial HHG carrier or may rent self-drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move.

(2) The commuted rate is calculated based on published HHG tariffs applied to the actual weight of the goods being shipped (subject also to the weight limitation in §§ 302-7.2 through 302-7.5).
