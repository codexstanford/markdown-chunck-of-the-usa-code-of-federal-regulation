####### ยง 102-118.130 Must my agency use a GBL for express, courier, or small package shipments?

No, however, in using commercial forms all shipments must be subject to the terms and conditions set forth for use of a bill of lading for the Government. Any other non-conflicting applicable contracts or agreements between the TSP and an agency involving buying transportation services for Government traffic remain binding. This purchase does not require a SF 1113. When you are using GSA's schedule for small package express delivery, the terms and conditions of that contract are binding.
