####### § 302-17.30 What is the purpose of the RITA?
######## substantially all

(a) The purpose of the RITA is to reimburse you for any taxes that you owe that were not adequately reimbursed by the WTA. As discussed in § 302-17.24, the WTA calculation is based on the income tax withholding rate applicable to supplemental wages. This may be higher or lower than your actual tax rate. The RITA, on the other hand, is based on your marginal tax rate, determined by your actual taxable income and filing status, which allows your agency to reimburse you forof your Federal income taxes. The RITA also reimburses you for any additional state and local taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation, because they are not reimbursed in the WTA process.

(b) The WTA may be optional to you. See § 302-17.61 for a discussion of criteria for choosing whether or not to accept the WTA. See §§ 302-17.62 through 302-17.69 for procedures if you choose not to accept the WTA.
