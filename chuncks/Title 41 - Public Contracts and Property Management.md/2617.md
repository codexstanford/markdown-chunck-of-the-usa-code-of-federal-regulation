(d) Upon receipt of a GSA-approved transfer document, promptly ship or release property to the transferee (or the transferee's designated agent) in accordance with pickup or shipping instructions on the transfer document;

(e) Notify the approving GSA regional office if surplus property to be picked up is not removed within 15 calendar days after you notify the transferee (or its agent) of its availability. (GSA will advise you of further disposal instructions.); and

(f) Perform and bear the cost of care and handling of surplus property pending its disposal, except as provided in § 102-37.115.
