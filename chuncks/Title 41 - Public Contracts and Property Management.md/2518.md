######## ยง 102-36.170 May we transfer personal property owned by one of our non-appropriated fund activities?

Property purchased by a non-appropriated fund activity is not federal property. A non-appropriated fund activity has the option of making its privately owned personal property available for transfer to a federal agency, usually with reimbursement. If such reimbursable personal property is not transferred to another federal agency, it may be offered for sale. Such property is not available for donation.
