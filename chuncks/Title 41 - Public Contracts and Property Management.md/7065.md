####### ยง 304-6.6 How do we determine the value of payments in kind that are to be reported on Standard Form (SF) 326?

The following should be used in the determination of the value of payments in kind for reporting on SF 326:

(a) For conference, training, or similar fees waived, discounted, or paid for by a non-Federal source on behalf of a meeting attendee, you must report the amount charged to other attendees. However, a waiver or discount of the registration fee by the non-Federal sponsor of the event for the day(s) the employee participated in the meeting or similar function as a speaker, panelist, or presenter is not a payment in kind and does not need to be reported.

(b) For transportation or lodging, you must report the cost that the non-Federal source paid or usually would have been charged for such event.
