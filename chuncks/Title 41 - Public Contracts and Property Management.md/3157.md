####### ยง 102-72.30 What are the different types of delegations related to real estate leasing?

Delegations related to real estate leasing include the following:

(a) Categorical space delegations and agency special purpose space delegations (see ยง 102-73.140 of this title).

(b) The Administrator of General Services has issued a standing delegation of authority (under a program known as "Can't Beat GSA Leasing") to the heads of all Federal agencies to accomplish all functions relating to leasing of up to 19,999 rentable square feet of general purpose space for terms of up to 20 years and below prospectus level requirements, regardless of geographic location. This delegation includes some conditions Federal agencies must meet when conducting the procurement themselves, such as training in lease contracting and reporting data to GSA.

(c) An ACO delegation, in addition to lease management authority, provides Federal agencies with limited contracting officer authority to perform such duties as paying and withholding lessor rent and modifying lease provisions that do not change the lease term length or the amount of space under lease.
