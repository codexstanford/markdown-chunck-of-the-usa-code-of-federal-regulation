If a vehicle operator fails to report an accident involving a GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle in accordance with ยง 101-39.401, or if the operator has a record showing a high accident frequency or cost, GSA will notify the appropriate official(s) of the operator's agency, and will advise that either failure to report an accident or poor driving record is considered by GSA to be sufficient justification for the agency to suspend the right of the employee to use a GSA IFMS vehicle.
