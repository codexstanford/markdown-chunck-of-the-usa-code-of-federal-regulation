(a) GSA is a mandatory source, under FPMR 101-26.501, for purchase of new non-tactical vehicles.

(b) Under unique circumstances which meet the criteria set forth under FPMR, motor vehicles may be purchased directly rather than through GSA when a waiver has been granted by GSA. The waiver request should be submitted directly to GSA and a copy forwarded to the Office of Management. GSA will grant waivers on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with FPMR 101-26.501(b)(c).
