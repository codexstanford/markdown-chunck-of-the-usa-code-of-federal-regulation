(a) You may request reimbursement on an actual expense basis, not to exceed 300 percent of the maximum per diem allowance.

(b) Approval of actual expenses is usually in advance of travel and at the discretion of your agency. (See ยง 301-11.302.) Also, see ยง 301-70.201 for when an agency can issue a blanket actual expense authorization.
