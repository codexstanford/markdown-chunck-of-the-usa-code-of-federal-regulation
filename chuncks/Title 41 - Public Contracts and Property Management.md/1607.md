######## Standard Form 368, Quality Deficiency Report (Category II).

(b)GSA is constantly striving to improve customer service and the quality of motor vehicles for which it contracts. To inform contractors of the deficiencies noted during the life of the vehicles, Standard Form 368 shall be prepared by the consignee and sent to GSA describing details of vehicle deficiency and action taken for correction. Procedures for documenting and reporting quality deficiencies are set forth in the GSA Publication "Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material or Billings." Agencies are urged to report all deficiencies to GSA irrespective of satisfactory corrective action taken by the manufacturer's authorized dealer. If the dealer refuses to take corrective action on any vehicle within its warranty period, the report shall so state and include an explanation of circumstances. Standard Form 368 shall also be used to report all noncompliance with specifications or other requirements of the purchase order.
