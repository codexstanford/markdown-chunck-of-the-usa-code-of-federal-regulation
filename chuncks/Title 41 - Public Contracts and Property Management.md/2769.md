####### Museum

means a public agency or nonprofit educational or public health institution that is organized on a permanent basis for essentially educational or aesthetic purposes and which, using a professional staff, owns or uses tangible objects, either animate or inanimate; and cares for these objects. A museum is considered to be attended by the public if the museum, at minimum, accedes to any request submitted for access during business hours. For the purposes of this definition, a museum uses a professional staff if it employs at least one full-time staff member or the equivalent, whether paid or unpaid, primarily engaged in the acquisition, care, or public exhibition of objects owned or used by the museum.
