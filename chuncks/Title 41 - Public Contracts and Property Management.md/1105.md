3.The reasonable accommodation procedures should specify that a request for reasonable accommodation may be oral or written and should explain that there are no required "magic words" that must be used by the requester to request an accommodation. The procedures should also state that requests for reasonable accommodation may be made by an applicant, employee, or by a third party, such as a relative, job coach, or friend, on his or her behalf.
