####### ยง 301-73.101 How must we prepare to implement ETS?

You must prepare to implement ETS as expeditiously as possible by-

(a) Developing a migration plan and schedule to deploy ETS across your agency as early as possible with full deployment required no later than September 30, 2006;

(b) Requiring employees to use your ETS unless you approve an exception under ยง 301-50.6, ยง 301-73.102 or ยง 301-73.104;

(c) Establishing goals, plans and procedures to maximize agency-wide traveler use of your online self-service booking tool once you have fully deployed ETS within your agency. These goals, plans, and procedures should be available for submission to the ETS PMO upon its request.
