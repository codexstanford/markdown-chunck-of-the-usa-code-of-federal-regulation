####### ยง 102-117.55 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a rate tender?

(a) Using a rate tender is an advantage when you:

(1) Have a shipment that must be made within too short a time frame to identify or solicit for a suitable contract;

(2) Have shipments recurring between designated places, but do not expect sufficient volume to obtain favorable rates; or

(3) Are not in a position to make a definite volume and shipment commitment under a FAR contract.

(b) Using a rate tender may be a disadvantage when:

(1) You have sufficient time to use the FAR and this would achieve better results;

(2) You require transportation service for which no rate tender currently exists; or

(3) A TSP may revoke or terminate the tender on short notice.
