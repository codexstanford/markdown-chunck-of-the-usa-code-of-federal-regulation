######## ยง 102-37.515 Do SEAs have a priority over other SASP donees for DOD property?

Yes, SEAs have a priority over other SASP donees for DOD property, but only if DOD requests GSA to allocate surplus DOD property through a SASP for donation to a specific SEA. In such cases, DOD would be expected to clearly identify the items in question and briefly justify the request.
