The regulations in this part prescribe standards for the General Services Administration (GSA) use in the administrative collection, offset, compromise, and the suspension or termination of collection activity for civil claims for money, funds, or property, as defined by 31 U.S.C. 3701(b), unless specific GSA statutes or regulations apply to such activities or, as provided for by Title 11 of the United States Code, when the claims involve bankruptcy. The regulations in this part also prescribe standards for referring debts to the Department of Justice for litigation. Additional guidance is contained in the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-129 (Revised), "Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables," the Department of the Treasury's "Managing Federal Receivables," and other publications concerning debt collection and debt management.
