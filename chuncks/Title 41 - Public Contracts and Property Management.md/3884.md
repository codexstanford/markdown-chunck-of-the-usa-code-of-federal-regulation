####### ยง 102-85.35 What definitions apply to this part?
######## Non-cancelable space

means space that, due to its layout, design, location, or other characteristics, is unlikely to be needed by another GSA customer agency. Typical conditions that might cause space to be defined as non-cancelable are:

(1) Special space construction features;

(2) Lack of any realistic Federal need for the space other than by the requesting agency; and

(3) Remote location or unusual term (short or long) desired by the agency.
