(c) When donating drugs, biologicals, or reagents other than controlled substances, the SASP shall obtain a certification from the donee indicating that the items donated will be safeguarded, dispensed, and administered under competent supervision and in accordance with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents requested for donation by state agencies will not be transported by the state agency or stored in its warehouse prior to distribution to donees. Arrangements will be made by the state agency for the donee to make direct pickup at the holding agency after approval by GSA and after notification by the holding agency that the property is ready for pickup. Additionally, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property, SF 123 from a state agency requesting surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents for donation will not be processed or approved by GSA until it has been determined by the GSA donation representative that the specific donee is legally licensed to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property. A copy of the donee's license, registration, or other legal authorization to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property should be attached and made a part of the SF 123. The administration or use of drugs, biologicals, and reagents must be in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. 301,).
