(2) The lowest possible level of inventory investment for a given number of replenishments.

(c) When quantity purchase discounts or volume transportation rates will produce savings greater than the increased variable costs involved in procurement and possession, the economic purchase quantity (EPQ) principle shall be used as described in the GSA Handbook.
