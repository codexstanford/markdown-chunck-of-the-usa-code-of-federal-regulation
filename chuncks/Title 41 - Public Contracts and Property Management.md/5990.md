######## ยง 301-10.121 When may I use coach class seating upgrade programs?

Use of upgraded coach class seating options is generally a traveler's personal choice and therefore is at the traveler's personal expense. However, your agency approving official may approve reimbursement of the additional seat choice fee according to part 301-13 of this chapter or internal agency policy (see ยง 301-70.102(k)).
