####### ยง 102-75.1265 Are extensions granted to the Federal screening and response timeframes?

Generally, no. GSA believes the timeframes are sufficient for agencies to make a decision and respond. Requests for extensions must be strongly justified and approved by the appropriate GSA Regional Administrator. For example, agencies may request an extension of time to submit their formal transfer request if they are not promptly provided GSA's estimate of FMV after submission of the initial expression of interest. Agencies requesting extensions must also submit an agreement accepting responsibility for providing and funding protection and maintenance for the requested property during the period of the extension until the property is transferred to the requesting agency or the requesting agency notifies GSA that it is no longer interested in the property. This assumption of protection and maintenance responsibility also applies to extensions associated with a requesting agency's request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement (see ยง 102-75.205).
