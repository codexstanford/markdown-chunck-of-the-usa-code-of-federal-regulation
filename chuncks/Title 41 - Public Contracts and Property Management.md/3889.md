######## Predominant use

means the use to which the greatest portion of a location is put. Predominant use is determined by the Public Buildings Service (PBS), GSA, and will typically result in the designation of a location as one of four types of space-General Use, Warehouse, Unique, or Parking-even though some smaller portions of the space may be used for one or more of the other types of uses.
