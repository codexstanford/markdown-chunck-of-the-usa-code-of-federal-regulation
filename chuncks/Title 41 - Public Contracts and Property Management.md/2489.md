######## ยง 102-36.50 May we use a contractor to perform the functions of excess personal property disposal?

Yes, you may use service contracts to perform disposal functions that are not inherently governmental, such as warehousing or custodial duties. You are responsible for ensuring that the contractor conforms with the requirements of Title 40 of the United States Code and the Federal Management Regulation (41 CFR chapter 102), and any other applicable statutes and regulations when performing these functions.
