######## ยง 102-36.65 Why must we use excess personal property instead of buying new property?

Using excess personal property to the maximum extent practicable maximizes the return on government dollars spent and minimizes expenditures for new procurement. Before purchasing new property, check with the appropriate regional GSA Personal Property Management office or access GSAXcess &#xAE; for any available excess personal property that may be suitable for your needs. You must use excess personal property unless it would cause serious hardship, be impractical, or impair your operations.
