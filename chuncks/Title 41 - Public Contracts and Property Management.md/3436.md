The disposal agency must promptly provide the Attorney General with notice of any such proposed disposal and the probable terms or conditions, as required by 40 U.S.C. 559. If notice is given by any disposal agency other than GSA, a copy of the notice must also be provided simultaneously to the GSA Regional Office in which the property is located. Upon request, a disposal agency must furnish information that the Attorney General believes to be necessary in determining whether the proposed disposition or any other disposition of surplus real property violates or would violate any of the antitrust laws.
