####### ยง 302-14.102 What factors should we consider in determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive payment program?

In determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive payment program, you should consider:

(a) Whether the program will increase the percentage of residences sold for which employees find a bona fide buyer. You should establish a benchmark for the percentage of residences for which you expect employees to find a bona fide buyer resulting in lower homesale costs to you. If your historical percentage of employee-generated sales is below your benchmark, a home marketing incentive payment program may benefit you; and

(b) The expected net savings from a home marketing incentive payment program.
