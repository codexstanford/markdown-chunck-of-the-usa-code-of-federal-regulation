####### ยง 302-12.116 What must we consider in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method?
######## Cost of alternative methods.

(b)Under the fixed fee method of contracting, the fee includes a cost component for risks assumed by the relocation services company. Under the cost-reimbursable method of contracting, you are directly responsible for some or all of the costs associated with management of the contract. In deciding whether to use cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, must consider the cost of resources you would require (including personnel costs) to manage a cost-reimbursable relocation services contract.
