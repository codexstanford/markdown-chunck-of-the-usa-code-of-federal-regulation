####### Capacity-controlled coach class contract fare

(1)(_CA)-A contract City Pair Program coach class fare that is less expensive than the unrestricted contract City Pair Program coach class fare (YCA), but has limited inventory availability, meaning, once the flight reaches a certain capacity, _CA fares may no longer be available for booking. Unlike YCA fares, _CA fares are restricted by the availability of seats. Accordingly, early booking may increase the likelihood of booking a _CA fare. The first character of the three-character fare basis code varies by airline.
