######## § 102-75.175 What are GSA's responsibilities regarding transfer requests?

Before property can be transferred among Federal agencies, to mixed-ownership Government corporations, and to the municipal government of the District of Columbia, GSA must determine that-

(a) The transfer is in the best interest of the Government;

(b) The requesting agency is the appropriate agency to hold the property; and

(c) The proposed land use will maximize use of the real property, in terms of economy and efficiency, to minimize expenditures for the purchase of real property.

(Note: See Subpart I-Screening of Excess Federal Real Property (§§ 102-75.1220 through 102-75.1290) for information on screening and transfer requests.)
