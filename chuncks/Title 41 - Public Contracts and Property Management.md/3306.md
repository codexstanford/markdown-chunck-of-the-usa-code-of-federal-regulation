####### Smoking
######## ยง 102-74.325 Are designated smoking areas authorized in interior space?

No, unless specifically established by an agency head as provided by ยง 102-74.320(d). A previous exception for designated smoking areas is being eliminated. All designated interior smoking areas will be closed effective June 19, 2009. This six-month phase-in period is designed to establish a fixed but reasonable time for implementing this policy change. This phase-in period will provide agencies with time to comply with their obligations under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C. Ch. 71, Labor-Management Relations, in those circumstances where there is an exclusive union representative for the employees.
