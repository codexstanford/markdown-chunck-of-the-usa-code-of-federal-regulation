######## ยง 102-36.455 How do we report excess shelf-life items?

You must identify the property as shelf-life items by "SL", indicate the expiration date, whether the date is the original or an extended date, and if the date is further extendable. GSA may adjust the screening period based on re-use potential and the remaining useful shelf life.
