######## ยง 102-75.1185 What are suitability criteria?
######### Property containing flammable or explosive materials.

(2)A property located within 2,000 feet of an industrial, commercial, or Federal facility handling flammable or explosive material (excluding underground storage) will be determined unsuitable. Above ground containers with a capacity of 100 gallons or less, or larger containers that provide the heating or power source for the property, and that meet local safety, operation, and permitting standards, will not affect whether a particular property is determined suitable or unsuitable. Underground storage, gasoline stations, and tank trucks are not included in this category, and their presence will not be the basis of an unsuitability determination unless there is evidence of a threat to personal safety as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
