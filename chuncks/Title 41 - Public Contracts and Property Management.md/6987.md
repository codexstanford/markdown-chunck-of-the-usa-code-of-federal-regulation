####### ยง 302-17.102 What happens if an employee fails to file and/or amend a "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status" prior to the required date?

(a) If a relocating employee does not file and/or amend a "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status" prior to the required date, and you are using a one-year RITA process, you are to switch to a two-year RITA process and send a written warning to the employee reminding them of the requirement and informing them that if they do not submit the "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status," you may declare the entire amount of the WTA forfeited.

(b) If the relocating employee does not file and/or amend a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to the required date, and you are using a two-year RITA process, you are to send the employee a written warning informing them they have 60 days to file or amend their "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status," or you will declare the WTA that you have already paid on his/her behalf forfeited and due as a debt to the Government.

(c) If the relocating employee chose not to receive the WTA and fails to file a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to your required date, you are to send the employee a written warning that they have 60 days to file. If the employee still fails to file, you may close your case file and refuse any later claims for RITA related to this specific relocation.
