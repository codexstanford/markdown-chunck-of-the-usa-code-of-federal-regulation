####### Conditional Eligibility
######## ยง 102-37.430 What property can a SASP make available to a donee with conditional eligibility?

You may only make available surplus property that the donee can use immediately. You may not make available property that will only be used at a later date, for example, after the construction of the donee's facility has been completed. If property is provided to the donee with conditional eligibility, and the conditional eligibility lapses (see ยง 102-37.420), the property must be returned to the SASP for redistribution or disposal.
