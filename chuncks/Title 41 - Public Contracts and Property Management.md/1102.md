##### Appendix B to Part 60-741 - Developing Reasonable Accommodation Procedures

As stated in §§ 60-741.21(a)(6) and 60-741.44(d), the development and use of written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation is a best practice. This Appendix provides guidance contractors may wish to use should they decide to adopt this best practice. As stated in the regulations, contractors are not required to use written reasonable accommodation procedures, and the failure to use such procedures will not result in a finding of violation.
