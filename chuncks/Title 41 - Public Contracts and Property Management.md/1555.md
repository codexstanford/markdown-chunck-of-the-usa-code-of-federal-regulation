####### ยง 101-25.404 Furniture.

Furniture (office, household and quarters, and institutional) shall not be replaced unless the estimated cost of repair or rehabilitation (based on GSA term contracts), including any transportation expense, exceeds at least 75 percent of the cost of a new item of the same type and class (based on prices as shown in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog, applicable Federal Supply Schedules, or the lowest available market price). An exception is authorized in those unusual situations in which rehabilitation of the furniture at 75 percent or less of the cost of a new item would not extend its useful life for a period compatible with the cost of rehabilitation as determined by the agency head or his designee.
