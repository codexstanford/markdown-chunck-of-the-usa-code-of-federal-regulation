(a) Except for the vending or exchange of chances by licensed blind operators of vending facilities for any lottery set forth in a State law and authorized by section 2(a)(5) of the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107), all persons entering in or on Federal property are prohibited from-

(1) Participating in games for money or other personal property;

(2) Operating gambling devices;

(3) Conducting a lottery or pool; or

(4) Selling or purchasing numbers tickets.

(b) This provision is not intended to prohibit prize drawings for personal property at otherwise permitted functions on Federal property, provided that the game or drawing does not constitute gambling per se. Gambling per se means a game of chance where the participant risks something of value for the chance to gain or win a prize.
