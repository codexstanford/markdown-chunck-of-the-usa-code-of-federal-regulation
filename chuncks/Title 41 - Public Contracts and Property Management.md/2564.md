To dispose of foreign excess personal property, you may:

(a) Offer the property for re-use by U.S. Federal agencies overseas;

(b) Return the property to the U.S. for re-use by eligible recipients;

(c) Sell, exchange, lease, or transfer such property for cash, credit, or other property;

(d) Donate medical materials or supplies to nonprofit medical or health organizations, including those qualified under sections 214(b) and 607 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2174, 2357); or

(e) Abandon, destroy or donate such property when you determine that it has no commercial value or the estimated cost of care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 527. Abandonment, destruction or donation actions must also comply with the laws of the country in which the property is located.
