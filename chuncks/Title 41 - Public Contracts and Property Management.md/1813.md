(c)(1) Each item of supply identified in the Federal Catalog System shall be assigned a national stock number which shall consist of the applicable 4-digit FSC class code and a 9-digit national item identification number.

(2) The national stock number shall be the only stock number used in supply operations for items within the scope of the Federal Catalog System. The integrity of the national stock number shall always be maintained whenever it is employed in any operation or document. Supply management codes, or other management symbols, may be associated with, but never included as a part of the national stock number. These management codes or symbols shall always be separated from the national stock number in such a manner that the national stock number is clearly distinguishable.
