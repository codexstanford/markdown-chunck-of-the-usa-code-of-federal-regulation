######## ยง 102-74.205 What Federal facility ridesharing policy must Executive agencies follow?

(a) In accordance with Executive Order 12191, "Federal Facility Ridesharing Program" (3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 138), Executive agencies must actively promote the use of ridesharing (carpools, vanpools, privately leased buses, public transportation, and other multi-occupancy modes of travel) by personnel working at Federal facilities to conserve energy, reduce congestion, improve air quality, and provide an economical way for Federal employees to commute to work.

(b) In accordance with the Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act (Public Law 103-172), the Federal Government is required to take steps to improve the air quality, and to reduce traffic congestion by providing for the establishment of programs that encourage Federal employees to commute to work by means other than single-occupancy motor vehicles.

(c) In accordance with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (Public Law 105-178), employers, including the Federal Government, are to offer employees transportation fringe benefits.
