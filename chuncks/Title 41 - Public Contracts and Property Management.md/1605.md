(2)Delivery times for motor vehicle requirements submitted for volume consolidated purchases will range from 210 to 330 days after solicitation consolidation date. Included in delivery time estimates are 90 to 105 days required for soliciting and receiving offers, 30 to 60 days for evaluation and award of contracts, 90 to 180 days from date of award for delivery of vehicles to destination (dealer or consignee, as applicable).

(3) For buses, ambulances, and other special duty vehicles which can not be procured under the standardized buying programs or consolidated purchase programs described in §§ 101-26.501-2 and 101-26.501-3, 240 to 270 days from date of award are usually required to effect delivery. However, special purpose vehicles with unique characteristics, such as certain types of firetrucks, may require longer delivery. In such instances, every effort will be made by GSA to facilitate deliveries and keep the requisitioning agencies informed of any unauthorized delay.
