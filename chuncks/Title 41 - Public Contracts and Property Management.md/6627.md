####### ยง 302-6.303 What factors should we consider in determining whether the TQSE allowance is actually necessary?
######## The existence of less expensive alternatives.

(b)If a less expensive alternative to the TQSE allowance exists that will enable the employee to find permanent quarters at the new official station, you should consider such an alternative. For example, authorize a househunting trip instead of temporary quarters if it would cost less overall.
