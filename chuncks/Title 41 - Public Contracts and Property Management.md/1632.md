####### ยง 101-26.508-3 Consolidation of requisitions.

To the maximum extent feasible, agencies shall develop procedures which will permit planned consolidated requisitioning of EDP tape and instrumentation tape (wide and intermediate band) on an agencywide basis. When agencywide consolidation is not feasible, consideration shall be given to the consolidation of individual requisitions for small quantities at any agency level. This will enable the Government to benefit from lower prices generally obtainable through large volume procurements.
