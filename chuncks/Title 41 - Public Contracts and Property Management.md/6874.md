####### ยง 302-12.119 Under a homesale program, may we pay an employee for losses he/she incurs on the sale of a residence?

No, under a home sale program, you may not pay an employee for losses he/she incurs on the sale of a residence, but this does not preclude you reimbursing a relocation service's company for losses incurred while the contractor holds the property.
