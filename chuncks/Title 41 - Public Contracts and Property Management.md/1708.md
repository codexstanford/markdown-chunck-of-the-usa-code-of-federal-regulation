####### ยง 101-27.503 Allowable credit.

Allowable credit for activities returning material that is accepted by GSA will be reflected in billings by GSA and will be commensurate with the condition of the material received.

(a) Credit will be granted at the rate of 80 percent of the current GSA selling price after acceptance by GSA for new, used, repaired, or reconditioned material which is serviceable and issuable to all agencies without limitation or restriction (condition code A).

(b) Credit will be granted at the rate of 60 percent of the current GSA selling price for items which involve limited expenses or effort to restore to serviceable condition, and which is accomplished in the storage activity where the stock is located (e.g., a deficiency in packing or packaging which restricts the issue or requires repacking or repackaging (condition code E)).

(c) No credit will be given for material returned to GSA which does not meet the above criteria or which was returned to GSA without prior approval.
