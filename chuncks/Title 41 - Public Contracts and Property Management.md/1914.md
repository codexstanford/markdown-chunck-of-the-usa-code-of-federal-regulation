####### ยง 101-39.302 Rotation.

GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicles on high mileage assignments may be rotated with those on low mileage assignments to assure more uniform overall fleet utilization. In cases where the continued use of a vehicle is essential but its miles traveled are not consistent with utilization guidelines, the using agency may be required to justify, in writing, retention of the vehicle. Each GSA IFMS fleet manager will decide on a case-by-case basis which vehicles, if any, will be rotated based upon vehicle type, vehicle location, location and availability of replacement vehicles, and the mission of the using agency.
