####### ยง 302-3.407 What is the effect on my TCS reimbursement if my assignment lasts less than 6 months?

Your agency may authorize a TCS only when a TCS is expected to last 6 months or more. If your assignment is cut short for reasons other than separation from Government service, you will be paid TCS expenses.
