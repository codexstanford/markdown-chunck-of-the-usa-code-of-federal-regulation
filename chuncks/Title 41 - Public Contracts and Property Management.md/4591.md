###### ยง 105-56.010 Deductions.
####### Installment deductions.

(1)Installment deductions will be made over the shortest period possible. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment normally will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three (3) years or less, unless circumstances warrant a longer period. Installment payments of less than $100 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.
