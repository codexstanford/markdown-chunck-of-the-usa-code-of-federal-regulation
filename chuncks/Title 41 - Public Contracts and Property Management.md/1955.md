####### Deviations
######## ยง 102-2.65 When may agencies deviate from the FMR?

Because, it consists primarily of set policies and mandatory requirements, deviation from the FMR should occur infrequently. However, to address unique circumstances or to test the effectiveness of potential policy changes, agencies may be able to deviate from the FMR after following the steps described in ยง 102-2.80.
