####### ยง 102-117.115 How do I calculate total delivery costs?

You calculate total delivery costs for a shipment by considering all costs related to the shipping or receiving process, such as packing, blocking, bracing, drayage, loading and unloading, and transporting. Surcharges such as fuel, currency exchange, war risk insurance, and other surcharges should also be factored into the costs.
