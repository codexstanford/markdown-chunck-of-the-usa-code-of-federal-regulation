You must properly mark, tag, or label personal property with special handling requirements in accordance with applicable Federal law, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements (29 CFR 1910.1200), regarding the actual or potential hazard associated with the property, and ensure that such information is maintained and perpetuated in the official agency property records.
