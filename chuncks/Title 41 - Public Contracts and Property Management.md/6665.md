####### ยง 302-7.104 What documentation must be provided for reimbursement?

When claiming reimbursement under the commuted rate, you must provide:

(a) A receipted copy of the bill of lading (reproduced copies are acceptable) including any attached weight certificate copies if issued; or

(b) Other evidence showing points of origin and destination and the weight of your HHG, if no bill of lading was issued, or

(c) If a commercial HHG carrier is not used, you are responsible for establishing the weight of the HHG, and temporary storage by obtaining proper certified weight certificates. Certified weight certificates include the gross and tare weights. This is required because payment at commuted rates on the basis of constructive weight usually is not possible.
