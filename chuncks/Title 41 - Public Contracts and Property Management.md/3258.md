######## ยง 102-74.50 Are Federal agencies required to give blind vendors priority in operating vending facilities?
######### et seq.

With certain exceptions, the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107) requires that blind persons licensed by a State licensing agency under the provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Act be authorized to operate vending facilities on Federal property, including leased buildings. The Department of Education (ED) is responsible for the administration of the Randolph-Sheppard Act as set forth at 34 CFR part 395. The ED designates individual State licensing agencies with program administration responsibility. The Randolph-Sheppard Act and its implementing regulations require that Federal property managers give priority to and notify the State licensing agencies in writing of any opportunity.
