####### ยง 109-43.5002 Reviews to determine need for retaining items.

Procedures and practices shall require an initial review at the time the plant is placed in standby to determine which items can be made available for use elsewhere within the established start-up criteria; periodic reviews (no less than biennially) to determine need for continued retention of property; and special reviews when a change in start-up time is made or when circumstances warrant. Such procedures should recognize that:

(a) Equipment, spares, stores items, and materials peculiar to a plant should be retained for possible future operation of the plant;

(b) Where practicable, common-use stores should be removed and used elsewhere; and

(c) Uninstalled equipment and other personal property not required should be utilized elsewhere on-site or be disposed of as excess.
