####### Initiation of lawsuits by the Attorney General without referral from the Director.

(d)In addition to initiating lawsuits upon referral under this section, the Attorney General may, subject to approval by the Director, initiate independent investigations of contractors which he/she has reason to believe may be in violation of the Order or the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto. If, upon completion of such an investigation, the Attorney General determines that the contractor has in fact violated the Order or the rules and regulations issued thereunder, he/she shall make reasonable efforts to secure compliance with the contract provisions of the Order. He/she may do so by providing the contractor and any other respondent with reasonable notice of the Department of Justice's findings, its intent to file suit, and the actions that the Attorney General believes are necessary to obtain compliance with the contract provisions of the Order without contested litigation, and by offering the contractor and any other respondent a reasonable opportunity for conference and conciliation in an effort to obtain such compliance without contested litigation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the Attorney General may, upon approval by the Director, bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States requesting a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, and an order for such additional sanctions or equitable relief, including back pay, deemed necessary or appropriate to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights secured by the Order or any of the above in this paragraph (d).

(e) To the extent applicable, this section and part 60-30 of this chapter shall govern proceedings resulting from any Director's determinations under ยง 60-2.2(b) of this chapter.
