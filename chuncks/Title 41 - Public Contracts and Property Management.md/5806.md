###### ยง 201-1.200 Information sharing agency (ISA).

The Act requires the FASC to identify an appropriate executive agency-the FASC's information sharing agency (ISA)-to perform administrative information sharing functions on behalf of the FASC, as provided at 41 U.S.C. 1323(a)(3). The ISA facilitates and provides administrative support to a FASC supply chain and risk management Task Force, and serves as the liaison to the FASC on behalf of the Task Force, as the Task Force develops the processes under which the functions described in 41 U.S.C. 1323(a)(3) are implemented on behalf of the FASC. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acting primarily through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is named the appropriate executive agency to serve as the FASC's ISA. The ISA's administrative functions shall not be construed to limit or impair the authority or responsibilities of any other Federal agency with respect to information sharing.
