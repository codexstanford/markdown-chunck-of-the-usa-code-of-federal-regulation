######## ยง 102-42.15 Under what circumstances may an employee retain a foreign gift or decoration?

Employees, with the approval of their employing agencies, may accept and retain:

(a) Gifts of minimal value received as souvenirs or marks of courtesy. When a gift of more than minimal value is accepted, the gift becomes the property of the U.S. Government, not the employee, and must be reported.

(b) Decorations that have been offered or awarded for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance. If the employing agency disapproves retention of the decoration by the employee, the decoration becomes the property of the U.S. Government.
