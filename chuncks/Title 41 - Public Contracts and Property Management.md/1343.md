(a) In the programs involving the transfer of surplus property for airport, park or recreation, historic monument, wildlife conservation, or street widening purposes (§ 101-6.217(c), (d), (e), and (h)), the public generally is entitled to the use of the facility and to receive the services provided by the facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith, without segregation or any other discriminatory practices.

(b) In the program involving the loan of machine tools to nonprofit institutions or training schools (§ 101-6.217(o)), discrimination by the recipient in the admission of students or trainees or in the treatment of its students or trainees in any aspect of the educational process is prohibited. In the case of an institution of higher education, the prohibition applies to the entire institution.

In this and other illustrations the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the recipient.

(c) In the programs involving the donation of personal property to public bodies or the American National Red Cross (§ 101-6.217 (f) and (j)), discrimination in the selection or treatment of individuals to receive or receiving the benefits or services of the program is prohibited.
