####### ยง 101-5.104-2 Basis for determining economic feasibility.

(a) Whenever possible, determination of the economic feasibility of a proposed centralized service shall be based upon standard data on the relationship of the size of the Federal building, the number of occupants, location, and other factors pertinent to the type of centralized service being considered.

(b) In the absence of standard data on which a determination of economic feasibility can be based, or where such data must be supplemented by additional factual information, a formal feasibility study may be made by GSA or a CASU workgroup, in coordination with local agencies to be involved, prior to a final determination to proceed with the furnishing of a centralized service. Generally, a formal feasibility study will be made only if provision of the proposed centralized service would involve the pooling of staff, equipment, and space which occupying agencies otherwise would be required to use in providing the service for themselves. Examples of centralized services which may require formal studies include printing and duplicating plants and similar facilities.

(c) On the basis of experience under the centralized services program, GSA will develop criteria as to cost comparisons, production needs, building population, number of agencies involved, and other appropriate factors for consideration in determining the practicability of establishing various types of centralized services.
