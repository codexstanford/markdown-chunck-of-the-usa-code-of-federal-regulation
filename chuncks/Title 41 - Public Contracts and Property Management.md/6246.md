(b) Ensure that managers and supervisors are provided monthly delinquency and questionable charges report.

(c) Periodically, but at least once a year, verify that cardholders are still current employees.

(e) Work with the charge card contractor to block certain high-risk category codes (e.g., department stores, automobile dealerships, specialty stores), etc.

(f) Review ATM cash withdrawals for reasonableness and association with official travel.

(g) Implement a salary offset program. (See part 301-76 of this chapter).
