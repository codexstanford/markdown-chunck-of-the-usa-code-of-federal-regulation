####### ยง 302-12.116 What must we consider in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method?
######## Risk of alternative methods.

(a)Under a fixed fee contract, the relocation services company bears all risks not expressly contained in the contract. Under a cost-reimbursable contract, you must assume some or all risks and, therefore, must assume some management responsibilities under the contract as well. For example, under a fixed fee homesale program you are not directly liable for losses incurred if a residence does not sell immediately, while under a cost-reimbursable homesale program you assume some or all risks of selling the residence.
