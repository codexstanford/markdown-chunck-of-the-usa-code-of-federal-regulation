(2)-(a)Users of selection procedures other than those complying with section 15A(1) of this part should maintain and have available for each job records or other information showing whether the total selection process for that job has an adverse impact on any of the groups for which records are called for by section 4B of this part. Adverse impact determinations should be made at least annually for each such group which constitutes at least 2 percent of the labor force in the relevant labor area or 2 percent of the applicable workforce. Where a total selection process for a job has an adverse impact, the user should maintain and have available records or other information showing which components have an adverse impact. Where the total selection process for a job does not have an adverse impact, information need not be maintained for individual components except in circumstances set forth in subsection 15A(2)(b) of this section. If the determination of adverse impact is made using a procedure other than the "four-fifths rule," as defined in the first sentence of section 4D of this part, a justification, consistent with section 4D of this part, for the procedure used to determine adverse impact should be available.
