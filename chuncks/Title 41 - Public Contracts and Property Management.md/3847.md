######## ยง 102-83.110 When an agency's mission and program requirements call for the location in an urban area, are Executive agencies required to give first consideration to central business areas?

Yes, if an agency has a specific location need to be in an urban area, then Executive Orders 12072 and 13006 require that agencies should give first consideration to locating in a historic building in a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give consideration to locating in a non-historic building in a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give consideration to locating in a historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies should give consideration to locating in a non-historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area.
