(d) The Appropriate Authority will notify the current or former employee, the appropriate supervisor, and such other persons as circumstances may warrant, whether disclosure or production is authorized, and of any conditions or limitations to disclosure or production.

(e) Factors to be considered by the Appropriate Authority in responding to demands:

(1) Whether disclosure or production is appropriate under rules of procedure governing the proceeding out of which the demand arose;

(2) The relevance of the testimony or documents to the proceedings;

(3) The impact of the relevant substantive law concerning applicable privileges recognized by statute, common law, judicial interpretation or similar authority;

(4) The information provided by the issuer of the demand in response to requests by the Appropriate Authority pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section;

(5) The steps taken by the issuer of the demand to minimize the burden of disclosure or production on GSA, including but not limited to willingness to accept authenticated copies of material in lieu of personal appearance by GSA employees;

(6) The impact on pending or potential litigation involving GSA or the United States as a party;

(7) In consultation with the head of the GSA organizational component affected, the burden on GSA which disclosure or production would entail; and

(8) Any additional factors unique to a particular demand or proceeding.

(f) The Appropriate Authority shall not approve a disclosure or production which would:

(1) Violate a statute or a specific regulation;

(2) Reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified by the originating agency;

(3) Reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the investigative agency and the source or informant consent;

(4) Reveal records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes which would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures the effectiveness of which would be impaired;

(5) Reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential without prior consultation with the person from whom it was obtained; or

(6) Be contrary to a recognized privilege.

(g) The Appropriate Authority's determination, including any reasons for denial or limitations on disclosure or production, shall be made as expeditiously as possible and shall be communicated in writing to the issuer of the demand and appropriate current or former GSA employee(s). In proceedings in which GSA, its current or former employees, or the United States are represented by DOJ, the determination shall be coordinated with DOJ which may respond to the issuer of the subpoenas or demand in lieu of the Appropriate Authority.
