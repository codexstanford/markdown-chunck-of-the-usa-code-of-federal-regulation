###### Appendix to Part 102-83 - Memorandum of Understanding Between the Department Of Housing And Urban Development And the General Services Administration Concerning Low- And Moderate-Income Housing
####### Purpose.

The purpose of the memorandum of understanding is to provide an effective, systematic arrangement under which the Federal Government, acting through HUD and GSA, will fulfill its responsibilities under law, and as a major employer, in accordance with the concepts of good management, to assure for its employees the availability of low- and moderate-income housing without discrimination because of race, color, religion, or national origin, and to consider the need for development and redevelopment of areas and the development of new communities and the impact on improving social and economic conditions in the area, whenever Federal Government facilities locate or relocate at new sites, and to use its resources and authority to aid in the achievement of these objectives.

1. Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601) states, in section 801, that "It is the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States." Section 808(a) places the authority and responsibility for administering the Act in the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Section 808(d) requires all Executive departments and agencies to administer their programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes of title VIII (fair housing) and to cooperate with the Secretary to further such purposes. Section 808(e)(5) provides that the Secretary of HUD shall administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of title VIII.

2. Section 2 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1441) declares the national policy of "* * * the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family * * *." This goal was reaffirmed in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (sections 2 and 1601; 12 U.S.C. 1701t and 42 U.S.C. 1441a).

3. By virtue of the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended; the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended; and Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, the Administrator of General Services is given certain authority and responsibility in connection with planning, developing, and constructing Government-owned public buildings for housing Federal agencies, and for acquiring leased space for Federal agency use.

4. Executive Order 11512, February 27, 1970, sets forth the policies by which the Administrator of General Services and the heads of Executive agencies will be guided in the acquisition of both federally owned and leased office buildings and space.

5. While Executive Order No. 11512 provides that material consideration will be given to the efficient performance of the missions and programs of the Executive agencies and the nature and functions of the facilities involved, there are six other guidelines set forth, including:

- The need for development and redevelopment of areas and the development of new communities, and the impact a selection will have on improving social and economic conditions in the area; and

- The availability of adequate low- and moderate-income housing, adequate access from other areas of the urban center, and adequacy of parking.

6. General Services Administration (GSA) recognizes its responsibility, in all its determinations with respect to the construction of Federal buildings and the acquisition of leased space, to consider to the maximum possible extent the availability of low- and moderate-income housing without discrimination because of race, color, religion, or national origin, in accordance with its duty affirmatively to further the purposes of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and with the authorities referred to in paragraph 2 above, and the guidelines referred to in paragraph 5 above, and consistent with the authorities cited in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. In connection with the foregoing statement, it is recognized that all the guidelines must be considered in each case, with the ultimate decision to be made by the Administrator of General Services upon his determination that such decision will improve the management and administration of governmental activities and services, and will foster the programs and policies of the Federal Government.

7. In addition to its fair housing responsibilities, the responsibilities of HUD include assisting in the development of the Nation's housing supply through programs of mortgage insurance, home ownership and rental housing assistance, rent supplements, below market interest rates, and low-rent public housing. Additional HUD program responsibilities which relate or impinge upon housing and community development include comprehensive planning assistance, metropolitan area planning coordination, new communities, relocation, urban renewal, model cities, rehabilitation loans and grants, neighborhood facilities grants, water and sewer grants, open space, public facilities loans, Operation BREAKTHROUGH, code enforcement, workable programs, and others.

8. In view of its responsibilities described in paragraphs 1 and 7 above, HUD possesses the necessary expertise to investigate, determine, and report to GSA on the availability of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis and to make findings as to such availability with respect to proposed locations for a federally-constructed building or leased space which would be consistent with such reports. HUD also possesses the necessary expertise to advise GSA and other Federal agencies with respect to actions which would increase the availability of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis, once a site has been selected for a federally-constructed building or a lease executed for space, as well as to assist in increasing the availability of such housing through its own programs such as those described in paragraph 7 above.

9. HUD and GSA agree that:

(a) GSA will pursue the achievement of low- and moderate-income housing objectives and fair housing objectives, in accordance with its responsibilities recognized in paragraph 6 above, in all determinations, tentative and final, with respect to the location of both federally constructed buildings and leased buildings and space, and will make all reasonable efforts to make this policy known to all persons, organizations, agencies and others concerned with federally owned and leased buildings and space in a manner which will aid in achieving such objectives.

(b) In view of the importance to the achievement of the objectives of this memorandum of agreement of the initial selection of a city or delineation of a general area for location of public buildings or leased space, GSA will provide the earliest possible notice to HUD of information with respect to such decisions so that HUD can carry out its responsibilities under this memorandum of agreement as effectively as possible.
