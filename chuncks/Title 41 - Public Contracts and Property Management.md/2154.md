######### Disposal date,i.e.,

means the date that the disposing executive agency relinquishes responsibility for an aircraft, for example, when the agency transfers title in the case of an exchange/sale; returns the aircraft to the lessor or bailer; declassifies it (for FAIRS, declassification is considered a "disposal" action, even though the agency retains the property); or relinquishes custody to another agency (in the case of excess (transferred) or surplus (donated or sold) aircraft).
