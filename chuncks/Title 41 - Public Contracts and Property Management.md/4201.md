The GSA Transportation Audits Division

(a) Audits select TSP bills after payment;

(b) Audits select TSP bills before payment as needed to protect the Government's interest;

(c) Examines, settles, and adjusts accounts involving payment for transportation and related services for the account of agencies;

(d) Adjudicates and settles transportation claims by and against agencies;

(e) Offsets an overcharge by any TSP from an amount subsequently found to be due that TSP;

(f) Issues a Notice of Overcharge stating that a TSP owes a debt to the agency. This notice states the amount paid and the basis for the proper charge for the document reference number (DRN), and cites applicable contract, tariff, or tender, along with other data relied on to support the overcharge; and

(g) Issues a GSA Notice of Indebtedness when a TSP owes an ordinary debt to an agency. This notice states the basis for the debt, the TSP's rights, interest, penalty, and other results of nonpayment. The debt is due immediately and is subject to interest charges, penalties, and administrative cost under 31 U.S.C. 3717.
