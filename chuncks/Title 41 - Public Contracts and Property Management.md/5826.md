####### Submission of response by source and potential rescission of recommendation.

(c)Subject to any applicable procedures or processes developed by the FASC, and in accordance with any instructions provided to the source pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, a source may submit to the ISA information or argument in opposition to a FASC recommendation. If a source submits information or argument in opposition:

(1) The ISA will convey the source's submission to the FASC and any appropriate constituent bodies and to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence.

(2) Upon receipt of such information or argument in opposition, the FASC may rescind the recommendation if the FASC, consistent with the sole and unreviewable discretion provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section:

(i) Determines that the source has undertaken sufficient mitigation to reduce supply chain risk to an acceptable level; or

(ii) Decides that other grounds justify rescission.

(3) In the event that the FASC rescinds its recommendation, the ISA will communicate that decision to the source. The ISA will notify Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence of the rescission, and provide those officials with a summary of the FASC's reasoning.
