####### ยง 302-12.118 Under a homesale program, may we establish a maximum home value above which we will not pay for homesale services?

Yes, if a home exceeding the maximum value above which you will not pay is sold under your homesale program, the employee will be responsible for any additional costs. You must establish a maximum amount commensurate with your agency's experience. You may consider, among other factors, budgetary constraints, the value range of homes in areas where you have offices, and the value range of homes previously entered in your program.
