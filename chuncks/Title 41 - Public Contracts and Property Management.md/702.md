####### Rulings on admissibility; use of deposition.

(e)Subject to the provisions of this section, objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying. Any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice, in accordance with the following provisions:

(1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.

(2) The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or was designated to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership, association, or governmental agency which is a party may be used by the adverse party for any purpose.

(3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the administrative law judge finds: (i) That the witness is dead; or (ii) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (iii) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or (iv) upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable to allow the deposition to be used.

(4) If only part of a deposition is introduced in evidence by a party, any party may introduce any other parts by way of rebuttal and otherwise.
