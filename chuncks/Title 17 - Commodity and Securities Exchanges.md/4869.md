This authority to disclose shall be based on a determination that the transaction or market operation disrupts or tends to disrupt any market or is otherwise harmful or against the best interests of producers, consumers, or investors or that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the Act.

(b) Disclosure under this section shall only be made to a registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization official who is named in a list filed with the Commission by the chief executive officer of the registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization, which sets forth the official's name, business address and telephone number. The chief executive officer shall thereafter notify the Commission of any deletions or additions to the list of officials authorized to receive disclosures under this section. The original list and any supplemental list required by this paragraph shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, and a copy thereof shall also be filed with the Regional Coordinator for the region in which the registered entity, swap execution facility, or swap data repository is located or in which the registered futures association or self-regulatory organization has its principal office.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in any case in which a Commission employee delegated authority under this section believes it appropriate, he or she may submit to the Commission for its consideration the question of whether disclosure of information should be made.

(d) For purposes of this section, the term "official" shall mean any officer or member of a committee of a registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization who is specifically charged with market surveillance or audit or investigative responsibilities, or their duly authorized representative or agent, who is named on the list filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or any supplement thereto.

(e) For the purposes of this section, the term "self-regulatory organization" shall mean the same as that defined in section 3(a) (26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(f) Any registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization receiving information from the Commission under these provisions shall not disclose such information except that disclosure may be made in any self-regulatory action or proceeding.
