For Required Transactions as defined in § 37.9, a swap execution facility may demonstrate compliance with § 37.600 by setting and enforcing position limitations or position accountability levels only with respect to trading on the swap execution facility's own market. For Permitted Transactions as defined in § 37.9, a swap execution facility may demonstrate compliance with § 37.600 by setting and enforcing position accountability levels or sending the Commission a list of Permitted Transactions traded on the swap execution facility.
