###### secured demand note agreement

(v)(A) The termshall mean an agreement (including the related secured demand note) evidencing or governing the contribution of a secured demand note to a broker or dealer and the pledge of securities and/or cash with the broker or dealer as collateral to secure payment of such secured demand note. The secured demand note agreement may provide that neither the lender, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns shall be personally liable on such note and that in the event of default the broker or dealer shall look for payment of such note solely to the collateral then pledged to secure the same.

(B) The secured demand note shall be a promissory note executed by the lender and shall be payable on the demand of the broker or dealer to which it is contributed; provided, however, that the making of such demand may be conditioned upon the occurrence of any of certain events which are acceptable to the Commission and to the Examining Authority for such broker or dealer.

(C) If such note is not paid upon presentment and demand as provided for therein, the broker or dealer shall have the right to liquidate all or any part of the securities then pledged as collateral to secure payment of the same and to apply the net proceeds of such liquidation, together with any cash then included in the collateral, in payment of such note. Subject to the prior rights of the broker or dealer as pledgee, the lender, as defined herein, may retain ownership of the collateral and have the benefit of any increases and bear the risks of any decreases in the value of the collateral and may retain the right to vote securities contained within the collateral and any right to income therefrom or distributions thereon, except the broker or dealer shall have the right to receive and hold as pledgee all dividends payable in securities and all partial and complete liquidating dividends.

(D) Subject to the prior rights of the broker or dealer as pledgee, the lender may have the right to direct the sale of any securities included in the collateral, to direct the purchases of securities with any cash included therein, to withdraw excess collateral or to substitute cash or other securities as collateral, provided that the net proceeds of any such sale and the cash so substituted and the securities so purchased or substituted are held by the broker or dealer, as pledgee, and are included within the collateral to secure payment of the secured demand note, and provided further that no such transaction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the amount of any cash, plus the Collateral Value of the securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note would be less than the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note.

(E) Upon payment by the lender, as distinguished from a reduction by the lender which is provided for in (b)(6)(iii) or reduction by the broker or dealer as provided for in subparagraph (b)(7) of this appendix (D), of all or any part of the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note, a broker or dealer shall issue to the lender a subordinated loan agreement in the amount of such payment (or in the case of a broker or dealer that is a partnership credit a capital account of the lender) or issue preferred or common stock of the broker or dealer in the amount of such payment, or any combination of the foregoing, as provided for in the secured demand note agreement.
