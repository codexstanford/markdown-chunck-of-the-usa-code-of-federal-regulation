###### Transfer agent's standards and procedures.

(c)Every registered transfer agent shall establish:

(1) Written standards for the acceptance of guarantees of securities transfers from eligible guarantor institutions; and

(2) Procedures, including written guidelines where appropriate, to ensure that those standards are used in determining whether to accept or reject guarantees from eligible guarantor institutions. Such standards and procedures shall not establish terms and conditions (including those pertaining to financial condition) that, as written or applied, treat different classes of eligible guarantor institutions inequitably, or result in the rejection of a guarantee from an eligible guarantor institution solely because the guarantor institution is of a particular type specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)-(a)(2)(v) of this section.
