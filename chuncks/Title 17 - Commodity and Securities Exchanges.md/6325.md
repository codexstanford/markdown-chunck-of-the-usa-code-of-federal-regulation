###### Aggregating requests.

(8)If the Office of FOIA Services reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Office of FOIA Services may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Among the factors the Office of FOIA Services shall consider in deciding whether to aggregate are whether the requests were submitted close in time and whether the requests seek documents about related matters. The Office of FOIA Services may presume that multiple requests that involve related matters made by the same requester or a group of requesters within a 30 calendar day period have been made to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Office of FOIA Services will aggregate them only where it determines that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved.
