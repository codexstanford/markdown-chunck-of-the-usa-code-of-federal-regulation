(5)Any swap entity that, in accordance with a comparability determination issued under this section, complies with a foreign jurisdiction's standards, would be deemed to be in compliance with the Commission's corresponding requirements. Accordingly, if a swap entity has failed to comply with the foreign jurisdiction's standards or a comparability determination, the Commission may initiate an action for a violation of the Commission's corresponding requirements. All swap entities, regardless of whether they rely on a comparability determination, remain subject to the Commission's examination and enforcement authority.
