#### ยง 45.10 Reporting to a single swap data repository.
##### Clearing swaps.

(c)To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a given clearing swap, including clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap or that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, is reported to a single swap data repository:

(1) The derivatives clearing organization that is a counterparty to such clearing swap shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data for that clearing swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of an original swap for clearing, or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall transmit to the counterparty to each clearing swap the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.

(2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data and required swap continuation data for that clearing swap shall be reported by the derivatives clearing organization to the same swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

(3) For clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap, and for equal and opposite clearing swaps that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall report all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for such clearing swaps to a single swap data repository.
