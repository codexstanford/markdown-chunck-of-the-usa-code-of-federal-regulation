###### Notice.

(a)On the basis of information obtained by the Commission, the Commission may at any time give written notice to any applicant for registration or any registrant in any capacity under the Act that:

(1) The Commission alleges and is prepared to prove that the registrant or applicant is subject to one or more of the statutory disqualifications set forth in section 8a(2), 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act;

(2) The allegations set forth in the notice, if true, constitute a basis upon which registration may be denied, granted upon conditions, suspended, revoked or restricted;

(3) The applicant or registrant is entitled to file a response within thirty days of the date of service of the notice to challenge the evidentiary basis of the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice or show cause why, notwithstanding the accuracy of those allegations, registration should nevertheless be granted, or granted upon condition, or should not be conditioned, suspended, revoked or restricted; and

(4) If the applicant or registrant does not file a timely response to the notice:

(i) The applicant or registrant will be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on all issues and the facts stated in the notice shall be deemed to be true and conclusive for the purpose of finding that the applicant or registrant is subject to a statutory disqualification under sections 8a(2), 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act; and

(ii) A presiding officer may thereafter decide whether to issue an order of default in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section to deny, condition, suspend, revoke, or place restrictions upon registration based solely upon the facts set forth in the notice.
