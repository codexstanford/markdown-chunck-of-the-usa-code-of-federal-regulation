(2)Any entity seeking to register as a derivatives clearing organization shall submit to the Commission a completed Form DCO, which shall include a cover sheet, all applicable exhibits, and any supplemental materials, as provided in appendix A to this part (application). The Commission will not commence processing an application unless the applicant has filed the application as required by this section.

Upon its own initiative, an applicant may file with its completed application additional information that may be necessary or helpful to the Commission in processing the application.
