###### Net equity-separate capacities and calculations.

(a)(1) If a member of the clearing organization clears trades in commodity contracts through a commodity contract account carried by the debtor as a customer account for the benefit of the clearing member's public customers and separately through a house account, the clearing member shall be treated as having customer claims against the debtor in separate capacities with respect to the customer account and house account at the clearing organization, and by account class. A member shall be treated as part of the public customer class with respect to claims based on any commodity customer accounts carried as "customer accounts" by the clearing organization for the benefit of the member's public customers, and as part of the non-public customer class with respect to claims based on its house account.
