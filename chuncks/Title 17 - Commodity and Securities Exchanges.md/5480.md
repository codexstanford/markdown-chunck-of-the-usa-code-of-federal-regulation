This reason may be omitted from the disclosure table when: the institution does not have affiliates (or does not disclose personal information to its affiliates); the institution's affiliates do not use personal information in a manner that requires an opt-out; or the institution provides the affiliate marketing notice separately.

An institution not required to provide an opt-out under this subparagraph may elect to include this reason in the model form. Note: The CFTC's Regulations do not address the affiliate marketing rule.
