###### Nature and form of reports.

(e)The annual reports filed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section must be prepared and filed in accordance with the following requirements:

(1)(i) The broker or dealer is not required to engage an independent public accountant to provide the reports required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section if, since the date of the registration of the broker or dealer under section 15 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o) or of the previous annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this section:

(A) The securities business of the broker or dealer has been limited to acting as broker (agent) for a single issuer in soliciting subscriptions for securities of that issuer, the broker has promptly transmitted to the issuer all funds and promptly delivered to the subscriber all securities received in connection with the transaction, and the broker has not otherwise held funds or securities for or owed money or securities to customers; or

(B) The securities business of the broker or dealer has been limited to buying and selling evidences of indebtedness secured by mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien upon real estate or leasehold interests, and the broker or dealer has not carried any margin account, credit balance, or security for any securities customer.

(ii) A broker or dealer that files an annual report under paragraph (d) of this section that is not covered by a report prepared by an independent public accountant must include in the oath or affirmation required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section a statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon as a basis for exemption from the requirement that the annual report filed under paragraph (d) of this section be covered by reports prepared by an independent public accountant.

(2) The broker or dealer must attach to the financial report an oath or affirmation that, to the best knowledge and belief of the person making the oath or affirmation:

(i) The financial report is true and correct; and

(ii) Neither the broker or dealer, nor any partner, officer, director, or equivalent person, as the case may be, has any proprietary interest in any account classified solely as that of a customer. The oath or affirmation must be made before a person duly authorized to administer such oaths or affirmations. If the broker or dealer is a sole proprietorship, the oath or affirmation must be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; if a corporation, by a duly authorized officer; or if a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, manager, managing member, or those members vested with management authority for the limited liability company or limited liability partnership.

(3) The annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this section are not confidential, except that, if the Statement of Financial Condition in a format that is consistent with Part II or Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (ยง 249.617 of this chapter) is bound separately from the balance of the annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this section, and each page of the balance of the annual reports is stamped "confidential," then the balance of the annual reports will be deemed confidential to the extent permitted by law. However, the annual reports, including the confidential portions, will be available for official use by any official or employee of the U.S. or any State, by national securities exchanges and registered national securities associations of which the broker or dealer filing such a report is a member, by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and by any other person if the Commission authorizes disclosure of the annual reports to that person as being in the public interest. Nothing contained in this paragraph (e)(3) may be construed to be in derogation of the rules of any registered national securities association or national securities exchange that give to customers of a broker or dealer the right, upon request to the broker or dealer, to obtain information relative to its financial condition.

(4) The broker or dealer must file with SIPC a report on the SIPC annual general assessment reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms that contains such information and is in such format as determined by SIPC by rule and approved by the Commission.
