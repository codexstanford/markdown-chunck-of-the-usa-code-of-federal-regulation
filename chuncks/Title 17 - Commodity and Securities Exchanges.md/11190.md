###### Conditional registration.

(d)(1) An applicant that has submitted a complete Form SBSE-C (§ 249.1600c of this chapter) and a complete Form SBSE (§ 249.1600 of this chapter) or Form SBSE-A (§ 249.1600a of this chapter) or Form SBSE-BD (§ 249.1600b of this chapter), as applicable, in accordance with paragraph (c) within the time periods set forth in § 240.3a67-8 (if the person is a major security-based swap participant) or § 240.3a71-2(b) (if the person is a security-based swap dealer), and has not withdrawn its registration shall be conditionally registered.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an applicant that is a nonresident security-based swap dealer or nonresident major security-based swap participant (each as defined in § 240.15Fb2-4(a)) that is unable to provide the certification and opinion of counsel required by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1) shall instead provide a conditional certification and opinion of counsel as discussed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and upon the provision of such conditional certification and opinion of counsel, shall be conditionally registered, if the nonresident applicant submits a Form SBSE-C (§ 249.1600c of this chapter) and a Form SBSE (§ 249.1600 of this chapter), SBSE-A (§ 249.1600a of this chapter) or SBSE-BD (§ 249.1600b of this chapter), as applicable, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section within the time periods set forth in § 240.3a67-8 (if the person is a major security-based swap participant) or § 240.3a71-2(b) (if the person is a security-based swap dealer), that is complete in all respects but for the failure to provide the certification and the opinion of counsel required by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1), and has not withdrawn from registration.

(3) For purposes of this section, a conditional certification and opinion of counsel means a certification as required by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1)(i) and an opinion of counsel as required by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1)(ii) that identify, and are conditioned upon, the occurrence of a future action that would provide the Commission with adequate assurances of prompt access to the books and records of the nonresident security-based swap dealer or nonresident major security-based swap participant, and the ability of the nonresident security-based swap dealer or nonresident major security-based swap participant to submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. Such future action could include:

(i) Entry by the Commission and the foreign financial regulatory authority of the jurisdiction(s) in which the nonresident security-based swap dealer or nonresident major security-based swap participant maintains the books and records that are addressed by the certification and opinion of counsel required by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1) into a memorandum of understanding, agreement, protocol, or other regulatory arrangement providing the Commission with adequate assurances of:

(A) Prompt access to the books and records of the nonresident security-based swap dealer or nonresident major security-based swap participant; and

(B) The ability of the nonresident security-based swap dealer or nonresident major security-based swap participant to submit to onsite inspection or examination by the Commission; or

(ii) Issuance by the Commission of an order granting substituted compliance in accordance with § 240.3a71-6 to the jurisdiction(s) in which the nonresident security-based swap dealer or nonresident major security-based swap participant maintains the books and records that are addressed by the certification and opinion of counsel required by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1); or

(iii) Any other action that would provide the Commission with the assurances required by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1)(i) and by § 240.15Fb2-4(c)(1)(ii).
