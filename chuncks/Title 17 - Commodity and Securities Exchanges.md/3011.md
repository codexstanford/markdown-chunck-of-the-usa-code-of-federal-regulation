##### Guidance.

(a)The monitoring of trading activity in listed swaps should be designed to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the physical-delivery and cash settlement processes. The swap execution facility should have rules in place that allow it to intervene to prevent or reduce such market disruptions. Once a threatened or actual disruption is detected, the swap execution facility should take steps to prevent the market disruption or reduce its severity.
