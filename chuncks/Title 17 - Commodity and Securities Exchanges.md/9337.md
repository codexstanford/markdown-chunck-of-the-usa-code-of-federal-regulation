##### Provided,

(iii) Designating a new effective date for a previously filed post-effective amendment or registration statement for additional shares under paragraph (a) of this section, which has not yet become effective,that the new effective date shall be no earlier than the effective date designated in the previously filed amendment or registration statement under paragraph (a) of this section and no later than thirty days after that date;

(v) Making any non-material changes which the registrant deems appropriate;

(vi) Complying with ยง 230.415(a)(5) and (6); and

(vii) Any other purpose which the Commission shall approve.

(2) The registrant represents that the amendment is filed solely for one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that no material event requiring disclosure in the prospectus, other than one listed in paragraph (b)(1) or one for which the Commission has approved a filing under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section, has occurred since the latest of the following three dates:

(i) The effective date of the registrant's registration statement;

(ii) The effective date of its most recent post-effective amendment to its registration statement which included a prospectus; or

(iii) The filing date of a post-effective amendment or registration statement filed under paragraph (a) of this section which has not become effective; and

(3) The amendment or registration statement recites on the facing sheet thereof that the registrant proposes that the amendment or registration statement will become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.

(4) The representations of the registrant referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be made by certification on the signature page of the post-effective amendment or registration statement that the amendment or registration statement meets all of the requirements for effectiveness under paragraph (b) of this section. If counsel prepared or reviewed the post-effective amendment or registration statement filed under paragraph (b) of this section, counsel shall furnish to the Commission at the time the amendment or registration statement is filed a written representation that the amendment or registration statement does not contain disclosure which would render it ineligible to become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.
