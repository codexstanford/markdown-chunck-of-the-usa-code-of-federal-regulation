###### Requirements for guarantee agreement.

(j)(1) A guarantee agreement filed pursuant to this section must be signed in a manner sufficient to be a binding guarantee under local law by an appropriate person on behalf of the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer and the introducing broker, and each signature must be accompanied by evidence that the signatory is authorized to enter the agreement on behalf of the futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, or introducing broker and is such an appropriate person. For purposes of this paragraph (j), an appropriate person shall be the proprietor, if the firm is a sole proprietorship; a general partner, if the firm is a partnership; and either the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer, if the firm is a corporation; and, if the firm is a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, either the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the manager, the managing member, or those members vested with the management authority for the limited liability company or limited liability partnership.

(2) No futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer may enter into a guarantee agreement if:

(i) It knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital is less than the amount set forth in § 1.12(b) of this part or § 5.6(b) of this chapter, as applicable; or

(ii) There is filed against the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer an adjudicatory proceeding brought by or before the Commission pursuant to the provisions of sections 6(c), 6(d), 6c, 6d, 8a or 9 of the Act or § 3.55, 3.56 or 3.60 of this chapter.

(3) A retail foreign exchange dealer may enter into a guarantee agreement only with an introducing broker as defined in § 5.1(f)(1) of this chapter. A retail foreign exchange dealer may not enter into a guarantee agreement with an introducing broker as defined in § 1.3 of this part.

(4) A guarantee agreement filed in connection with an application for initial registration as an introducing broker in accordance with the provisions of § 3.10(a) of this chapter shall become effective upon the granting of registration or, if appropriate, a temporary license, to the introducing broker. A guarantee agreement filed other than in connection with an application for initial registration as an introducing broker shall become effective as of the date agreed to by the parties.

(5)(i) If the registration of the introducing broker is suspended, revoked, or withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the guarantee agreement shall expire as of the date of such suspension, revocation or withdrawal.

(ii) If the registration of the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer is suspended or revoked, the guarantee agreement shall expire 30 days after such suspension or revocation, or at such earlier time as may be approved by the Commission, the introducing broker, and the introducing broker's designated self-regulatory organization.

(6) A guarantee agreement may be terminated at any time during the term thereof:

(i) By mutual written consent of the parties, signed by an appropriate person on behalf of each party, with prompt written notice thereof, signed by an appropriate person on behalf of each party, to the Commission and to the designated self-regulatory organizations of the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer and the introducing broker;

(ii) For good cause shown, by either party giving written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement, signed by an appropriate person, to the other party to the agreement, to the Commission, and to the designated self-regulatory organizations of the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer and the introducing broker; or

(iii) By either party giving written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement, signed by an appropriate person, at least 30 days prior to the proposed termination date, to the other party to the agreement, to the Commission, and to the designated self-regulatory organizations of the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer and the introducing broker.

(7) The termination of a guarantee agreement by a futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer or an introducing broker, or the expiration of such an agreement, shall not relieve any party from any liability or obligation arising from acts or omissions which occurred during the term of the agreement.
