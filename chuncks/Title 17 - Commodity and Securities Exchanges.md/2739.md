## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 31 - LEVERAGE TRANSACTIONS
#### § 31.13 Financial reports of leverage transaction merchants.
##### Provided, however,

(h) The statements required by paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section may be presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the certified reports filed as of the close of the registrant's fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or accompanying the application for registration pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, rather than in the format specifically prescribed by these regulations:That the statement of financial condition is presented in a format as consistent as possible with the Form 2-FR and a reconciliation is provided reconciling such statement of financial condition to the statement of the computation of the minimum capital requirements pursuant to § 31.9. Such reconciliation must be certified by an independent public accountant in accordance with § 1.16 of this chapter.

(i) Attached to each Form 2-FR filed pursuant to this section must be an oath or affirmation that to the best knowledge and belief of the individual making such oath or affirmation the information contained in the Form 2-FR is true and correct. If the leverage transaction merchant is a sole proprietorship, then the oath or affirmation must be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; or, if a corporation, by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer.

(j) Any leverage transaction merchant wishing to establish a fiscal year other than the calendar year may do so by notifying the National Futures Association of its election of such fiscal year in writing, concurrently with the filing of Form 2-FR pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but in no event may such fiscal year end more than one year from the date of the Form 2-FR filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. A leverage transaction merchant which does not so notify the National Futures Association will be deemed to have elected the calendar year as its fiscal year. A leverage transaction merchant must continue to use its elected fiscal year, calendar or otherwise, unless a change in such fiscal year is approved upon written application to the designated self-regulatory organization.

(k) In the event any leverage transaction merchant finds that it cannot file its report for any period within the time specified in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section without substantial undue hardship, it may file with the designated self-regulatory organization an application for an extension of time to a specified date which may not be more than 90 days after the date as of which the financial report was to have been filed. The application must state the reasons for the requested extension and must contain an agreement to file the report on or before the specified date. The application must be received by the designated self-regulatory organization before the time specified in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section for filing the report. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the application for an extension of time, the designated self-regulatory organization shall: (1) Notify the leverage transaction merchant of the grant or denial of the requested extension; or (2) indicate that additional time is required to analyze the request, in which case the amount of time needed will be specified.

(l)(1) In the event a leverage transaction merchant finds that it cannot file its certified financial report and schedules for any year within the time specified in paragraph (b) of this section without substantial undue hardship, it may file with the designated self-regulatory organization an application for an extension of time to a specified date not more than 90 days after the date as of which the certified financial report and schedules were to have been filed. The application must be submitted by the leverage transaction merchant and must:

(i) State the reasons for the requested extension;

(ii) Indicate that the inability to make a timely filing is due to circumstances beyond the control of the leverage transaction merchant, if such is the case, and describe briefly the nature of such circumstances;

(iii) Be accompanied by the latest available formal computation of its adjusted net capital and minimum financial requirements computed in accordance with § 31.9;

(iv) Be accompanied by the latest available computation of required segregation and by a computation of the amount of leverage customer funds segregated pursuant to § 31.12 as of the date of the latest available computation;

(v) Be accompanied by the latest available computation of required cover and by a computation of cover provided pursuant to § 31.8 as of the date of the latest available computation;

(vi) Contain an agreement to file the report on or before the date specified by the leverage transaction merchant in the application;

(vii) Be received by the designated self-regulatory organization prior to the date on which the report is due; and

(viii) Be accompanied by a letter from the independent public accountant answering the following questions:

(A) What specifically are the reasons for the extension request?

(B) On the basis of that part of your audit to date, do you have any indication that may cause you to consider commenting on any material inadequacies in the accounting system, internal accounting controls or procedures for safeguarding customer or firm assets?

(C) Do you have any indication from the part of your audit completed to date that would lead you to believe that the firm was or is not meeting the minimum capital requirements specified in § 31.9 or the cover or segregation requirements of these regulations, or has any significant financial or recordkeeping problems?

(2) Within 10 calendar days after receipt of an application for extension of time, the designated self-regulatory organization shall:

(i) Notify the leverage transaction merchant of the grant or denial of the requested extension; or

(ii) Indicate that additional time is required to analyze the request, in which case the amount of time needed will be specified.

(3) On the written request of a leverage transaction merchant, or on its own motion, the designated self-regulatory organization may grant an extension of time or an exemption from any of the certified financial reporting requirements of this section either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions.

(m) The following portions of Form 2-FR filed pursuant to this section will be public: The statement of financial condition, the computation of the minimum capital requirements pursuant to § 31.9, the schedule of coverage requirements and cover provided, and the schedule of segregation requirements and funds on deposit in segregation. The other financial statements (including the statement of income (loss)), footnote disclosures and schedules of Form 2-FR, trade secrets and certain other commercial or financial information on such other statements and schedules, will be treated as nonpublic for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act and parts 145 and 147 of this chapter. All information on such other statements, footnote disclosures and schedules will, however, be available for official use by any official or employee of the United States or any State, by any self-regulatory organization of which the person filing such report is a member, by the National Futures Association in the case of an applicant, and by any other person to whom the Commission believes disclosure of such information is in the public interest. The independent public accountant's opinion filed pursuant to this section will be deemed to be public information.

(n)(1) Until such time as the Commission orders, otherwise, the Commission hereby delegates to the Director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight or his designee the authority to perform all functions reserved to the Commission in this section.
