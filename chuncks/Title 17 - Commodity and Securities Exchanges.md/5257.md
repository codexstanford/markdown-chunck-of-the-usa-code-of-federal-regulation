### PART 150 - LIMITS ON POSITIONS
#### ยง 150.9 Process for recognizing non-enumerated bona fide hedging transactions or positions with respect to Federal speculative position limits.
##### Timing of application.

(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the designated contract market or swap execution facility requires the applicant to submit an application and receive a notice of approval of such application from the designated contract market or swap execution facility prior to the date that the position for which such application was submitted would be in excess of the applicable Federal speculative position limits.

(ii) A designated contract market or swap execution facility may adopt rules that allow a person, due to demonstrated sudden or unforeseen increases in its bona fide hedging needs, to file an application with the designated contract market or swap execution facility to request a recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position within five business days after the person established the position that exceeded the applicable Federal speculative position limit.

(A) The designated contract market or swap execution facility must require that any application filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section include an explanation of the circumstances warranting the sudden or unforeseen increases in bona fide hedging needs.

(B) If an application filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is denied by the designated contract market, swap execution facility, or Commission, the applicant must bring its position within the applicable Federal speculative position limits within a commercially reasonable time as determined by the Commission in consultation with the applicant and the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility.

(C) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the designated contract market, swap execution facility, or Commission's review nor once a determination has been issued, so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the person complies with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
