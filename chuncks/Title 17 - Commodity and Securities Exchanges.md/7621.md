#### ยง 210.3-10 Financial statements of guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered.
##### Note 2 to paragraph (b)(2).

The phrase "set amount of interest" is not intended to mean "fixed amount of interest." Floating and adjustable rate securities, as well as indexed securities, may meet the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section as long as the payment obligation is set in the debt instrument and can be determined from objective indices or other factors that are outside the discretion of the obligor.

(3) A guarantee is "full and unconditional," if, when an issuer of a guaranteed security has failed to make a scheduled payment, the guarantor is obligated to make the scheduled payment immediately and, if it does not, any holder of the guaranteed security may immediately bring suit directly against the guarantor for payment of all amounts due and payable.
