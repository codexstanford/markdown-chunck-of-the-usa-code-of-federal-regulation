##### ยง 171.41 Petition for a stay of effective date of a member responsibility action pending a hearing by the National Futures Association.
###### Standards for granting petition for stay.

(d)In reviewing petitions to stay the effectiveness of the member responsibility action pending completion of further proceedings, the Commission shall consider:

(1) Whether, in the circumstances presented, the notice and opportunity for a hearing provided by the National Futures Association are consistent with principles of fundamental fairness; and

(2) The likelihood that the denial of the petition would result in irreparable harm to petitioner; and

(3) The effect a grant of the petition would have on the interests of the National Futures Association; and

(4) The effect a grant or denial of the petition would have on the public interest.

(e) If the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed by the National Futures Assocation in a member responsibility action is effective at the time a petition for a stay is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall not delay its decision on the petition to await the receipt of the National Futures Association's response. If the action is not effective at the time the petition is filed, the Commission will not act upon the petition prior to the receipt of a response from the National Futures Association unless, in its view, expedited action on the petition is necessary to protect petitioner's right to a meaningful determination of the right to a stay. If the Commission grants the petition prior to the receipt of the response of the National Futures Association, the association may seek reconsideration of the Commission's action within seven days of service of the decision.
