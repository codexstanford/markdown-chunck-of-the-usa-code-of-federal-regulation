##### Mirror swap

means a swap:

(1) To which-

(i) A prime broker is a counterparty; or

(ii) Both counterparties are prime brokers;

(2) That is executed contemporaneously with a corresponding trigger swap;

(3) That has identical terms and pricing as the contemporaneously executed trigger swap, except:

(i) That a mirror swap, but not the corresponding trigger swap, may include any associated prime brokerage service fees agreed to by the parties; and

(ii) As provided in paragraph (5) of this "mirror swap" definition;

(4) With respect to which the sole price forming event is the occurrence of the contemporaneously executed trigger swap; and

(5) The execution of which is contingent on, or is triggered by, the execution of the contemporaneously executed trigger swap. The contractually agreed payments and delivery amounts under a mirror swap may differ from those amounts of the corresponding trigger swap if:

(i) Under all such mirror swaps to which the prime broker that is a counterparty to the trigger swap is also a counterparty, the aggregate contractually agreed payments and delivery amounts shall be equal to the aggregate of the contractually agreed payments and delivery amounts under the corresponding trigger swap; and

(ii) The market risk and contractually agreed payments and delivery amounts of all such mirror swaps to which a prime broker that is not a counterparty to the corresponding trigger swap is a party will offset each other, resulting in such prime broker having a flat market risk position at the execution of such mirror swaps.
