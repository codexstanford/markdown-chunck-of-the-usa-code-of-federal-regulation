(2) Each swap data repository shall, at a minimum, make the following information available to the public and relevant authorities, including the Commission:

(i) The mission statement of the swap data repository;

(ii) The mission statement and/or charter of the board of directors, as well as of each committee of the swap data repository that has:

(B) The authority to amend or constrain actions of the board of directors;

(iii) The board of directors nomination process for the swap data repository, as well as the process for assigning members of the board of directors or other persons to any committee referenced in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section;

(iv) For the board of directors and each committee referenced in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the names of all members;

(v) A description of the manner in which the board of directors, as well as any committee referenced in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, considers an independent perspective in its decision-making process, as ยง 49.2(a) defines such term;

(vi) The lines of responsibility and accountability for each operational unit of the swap data repository to any committee thereof and/or the board of directors; and

(vii) Summaries of significant decisions impacting the public interest, the rationale for such decisions, and the process for reaching such decisions. Such significant decisions shall include decisions relating to pricing of repository services, offering of ancillary services, access to SDR data, and use of section 8 material, SDR information, and intellectual property (as referenced in ยง 49.16). Such summaries of significant decisions shall not require the swap data repository to disclose section 8 material or, where appropriate, information that the swap data repository received on a confidential basis from a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty.

(3) The swap data repository shall ensure that the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) to (vii) of this section is current, accurate, clear, and readily accessible, for example, on its Web site. The swap data repository shall set forth such information in a language commonly used in the commodity futures and swap markets and at least one of the domestic language(s) of the jurisdiction in which the swap data repository is located.

(4) Furthermore, the swap data repository shall disclose the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section in a sufficiently comprehensive and detailed fashion so as to permit the public and relevant authorities, including the Commission, to understand the policies or procedures of the swap data repository implicated and the manner in which the decision implements or amends such policies or procedures. A swap data repository shall not disclose minutes from meetings of its board of directors or committees to the public, although it shall disclose such minutes to the Commission upon request.
