## Chapter II - Securities and Exchange Commission
### PART 240 - GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
#### Capital, Margin and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
##### ยง 240.18a-7 Reports to be made by certain security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants.
###### Nature and form of reports.

(d)The annual reports filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section must be prepared and filed in accordance with the following requirements:

(1)(i) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must attach to each of the confidential and non-confidential portions of the annual reports separately bound under paragraph (d)(2) of this section a complete and executed Part III of Form X-17A-5 (ยง 249.617 of this chapter). The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must attach to the financial report an oath or affirmation that, to the best knowledge and belief of the person making the oath or affirmation:

(A) The financial report is true and correct; and

(B) Neither the registrant, nor any partner, officer, director, or equivalent person, as the case may be, has any proprietary interest in any account classified solely as that of a customer.

(ii) The oath or affirmation must be made before a person duly authorized to administer such oaths or affirmations. If the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is a sole proprietorship, the oath or affirmation must be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; if a corporation, by a duly authorized officer; or if a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, manager, managing member, or those members vested with management authority for the limited liability company or limited liability partnership.

(2) The annual reports filed under paragraph (c) of this section are not confidential, except that, if the Statement of Financial Condition is in a format that is consistent with Part II of Form X-17A-5 (ยง 249.617 of this chapter), and is bound separately from the balance of the annual reports filed under paragraph (c) of this section, and each page of the balance of the annual report is stamped "confidential," then the balance of the annual reports will be deemed confidential to the extent permitted by law. However, the annual reports, including the confidential portions, will be available for official use by any official or employee of the U.S. or any State, and by any other person if the Commission authorizes disclosure of the annual reports to that person as being in the public interest. Nothing contained in this paragraph (d)(2) may be construed to be in derogation of the right of customers of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, upon request to the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, to obtain information relative to its financial condition.
