###### Procedure for setting aside non-final default order.

(1)Any party or person who is the subject of a default order issued pursuant to these rules may, at any time before the order becomes final pursuant to ยง 12.22(c), file and serve a motion to set aside the default, which shall set forth reasons why the act or omission for which the party was defaulted was not willful, why there is a reasonable likelihood of success for the party's claim or defense if heard on the merits, and why no prejudice will be sustained by other parties if the default is set aside. A motion to set aside a default order filed pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1) shall be decided, in the first instance, by the official who issued the default order.
