### PART 45 - SWAP DATA RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
#### § 45.13 Required data standards.
##### Data validation acceptance message.

(b)(1) For each required swap creation data or required swap continuation data report submitted to a swap data repository, a swap data repository shall notify the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, or third-party service provider submitting the report whether the report satisfied the swap data validation procedures of the swap data repository. The swap data repository shall provide such notification as soon as technologically practicable after accepting the required swap creation data or required swap continuation data report. A swap data repository may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by transmitting data validation acceptance messages as required by § 49.10 of this chapter.

(2) If a required swap creation data or required swap continuation data report to a swap data repository does not satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository, the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, designated contract market, or derivatives clearing organization required to submit the report has not yet satisfied its obligation to report required swap creation or continuation data in the manner provided by paragraph (a) of this section within the timelines set forth in §§ 45.3 and 45.4. The reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, designated contract market, or derivatives clearing organization has not satisfied its obligation until it submits the required swap data report in the manner provided by paragraph (a) of this section, which includes the requirement to satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository, within the applicable time deadline set forth in §§ 45.3 and 45.4.
