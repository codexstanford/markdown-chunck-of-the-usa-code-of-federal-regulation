(ii) If the business is a related business (ยง 210.3-05(a)(3)), combined pre-acquisition financial statements of the group of related businesses for the fiscal year specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

(4) When a registrant, including a real estate investment trust, conducts a continuous offering over an extended period of time and applies the Item 20.D. Undertakings of Industry Guide 5, the income test condition does not apply, and the determination must be made for the investment test condition, when it is based on the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated, and the asset test condition, if applicable, using the following for the registrant:

(i) During the distribution period, total assets as of the date of acquisition or disposition plus the proceeds (net of commissions) in good faith expected to be raised in the registered offering over the next 12 months, except that for acquisitions total assets must exclude the acquired business; and

(ii) After the distribution period ends and until the next Form 10-K is filed, total assets as of the date of acquisition or disposition, except that for acquisitions total assets must exclude the acquired business; and

(iii) After that next Form 10-K is filed, the guidance in paragraph (b)(3).

(c) The pro forma effects of a business acquisition need not be presented pursuant to this section if separate financial statements of the acquired business are not included in the filing, except where the aggregate impact of businesses acquired or to be acquired is significant as determined by ยง 210.3-05(b)(2)(iv) or ยง 210.3-14(b)(2)(i)(C).

(d) For purposes of this rule, the term business should be evaluated in light of the facts and circumstances involved and whether there is sufficient continuity of the acquired entity's operations prior to and after the transactions so that disclosure of prior financial information is material to an understanding of future operations. A presumption exists that a separate entity, a subsidiary, or a division is a business. However, a lesser component of an entity may also constitute a business. Among the facts and circumstances which should be considered in evaluating whether an acquisition of a lesser component of an entity constitutes a business are the following:

(1) Whether the nature of the revenue-producing activity of the component will remain generally the same as before the transaction; or

(2) Whether any of the following attributes remain with the component after the transaction:

(i) Physical facilities,

(ii) Employee base,

(iii) Market distribution system,

(iv) Sales force,

(v) Customer base,

(vi) Operating rights,

(vii) Production techniques, or

(viii) Trade names.

(e) This rule does not apply to transactions between a parent company and its totally held subsidiary.
