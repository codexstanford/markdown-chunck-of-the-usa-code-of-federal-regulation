##### Maximum Price Fluctuation Limits.,1,2,3

(J)Designated contract markets may adopt price limits to: () Reduce or constrain price movements in a trading day that may not be reflective of true market conditions but might be caused by traders overreacting to news; () Allow additional time for the collection of margins in times of large price movements; and () Provide a "cooling-off" period for futures market participants to respond to bona fide changes in market supply and demand fundamentals that would lead to large cash and futures price changes. If price limit provisions are adopted, the limits should be set at levels that are not overly restrictive in relation to price movements in the cash market for the commodity underlying the futures contract.
