###### Preferential assignment among customer classes and account classes for clearing organization bankruptcies.

(iii)Section 190.18 is designed to support the interests of public customers of members of a debtor that is a clearing organization.

(A) Certain customer property is preferentially assigned to "customer property other than member property" instead of "member property" to the extent that there is a shortfall in funded balances for members' public customer claims. Moreover, to the extent that there are excess funded balances for members' claims in any customer class/account class combination, that excess is also preferentially assigned to "customer property other than member property" to the extent of any shortfall in funded balances for members' public customer claims.

(B) Where property is assigned to a particular customer class with more than one account class, it is assigned to the account class for which the funded balance percentage is the lowest until there are two account classes with equal funded balance percentages, then to both such account classes, keeping the funded balance percentage the same, and so forth following the analogous approach if the debtor has more than two account classes within the relevant customer class.
