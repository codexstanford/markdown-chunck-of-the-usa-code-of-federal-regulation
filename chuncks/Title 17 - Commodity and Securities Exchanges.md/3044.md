## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 37 - SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES
#### Appendix B to Part 37 - Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in, Compliance with Core Principles
##### Prorated expenses.

(2)The Commission recognizes that, in the normal course of a swap execution facility's business, there may be an expense (e.g., typically related to overhead) that is only partially attributable to a swap execution facility's ability to comply with the core principles set forth in section 5h of the Act and any applicable Commission regulations; accordingly, such expense may need to be only partially attributed to the swap execution facility's projected operating costs. For example, if a swap execution facility's office rental space includes marketing personnel and compliance personnel, the swap execution facility may exclude the prorated office rental expense attributable to the marketing personnel. In order to prorate an expense, a swap execution facility should:

(i) Maintain sufficient documentation that reasonably shows the extent to which an expense is partially attributable to an excludable expense;

(ii) Identify any prorated expense in the financial reports that it submits to the Commission pursuant to ยง 37.1306; and

(iii) Sufficiently explain why it prorated any expense. Common allocation methodologies that can be used include actual use, headcount, or square footage. A swap execution facility may provide documentation, such as copies of service agreements, other legal documents, firm policies, audit statements, or allocation methodologies to support its determination to prorate an expense.
