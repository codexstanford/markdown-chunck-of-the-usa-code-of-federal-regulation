###### Special rule for separately identifiable departments or divisions of banks for municipal advisory purposes.

(4)If a bank engages in municipal advisory activities through a separately identifiable department or division that meets the requirements of this paragraph (d)(4), the determination of whether those municipal advisory activities cause any person to be a municipal advisor may be made separately for such department or division. In such event, that department or division, rather than the bank itself, shall be deemed to be the municipal advisor.
