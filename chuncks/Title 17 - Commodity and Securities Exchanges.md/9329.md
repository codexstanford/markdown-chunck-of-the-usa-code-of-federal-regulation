(v) Making any non-material changes which the registrant deems appropriate;

(vi) In the case of a separate account registered as a unit investment trust, to make changes in the disclosure in the unit investment trust's registration statement to reflect changes to disclosure in the registration statement of the investment company in which the unit investment trust invests all of its assets; and

(vii) Any other purpose which the Commission shall approve.

(2) The registrant represents that the amendment is filed solely for one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that no material event requiring disclosure in the prospectus, other than one listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or one for which the Commission has approved a filing under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section, has occurred since the latest of the following three dates:

(i) The effective date of the registrant's registration statement;

(ii) The effective date of its most recent post-effective amendment to its registration statement which included a prospectus; or

(iii) The filing date of a post-effective amendment filed under paragraph (a) of this section which has not become effective.

(3) The amendment recites on its facing sheet that the registrant proposes that the amendment will become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.

(4) The representations of the registrant referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be made by certification on the signature page of the post-effective amendment that the amendment meets all the requirements for effectiveness under paragraph (b) of this section. If counsel prepared or reviewed the post-effective amendment filed under paragraph (b) of this section, counsel shall furnish to the Commission at the time the amendment is filed a written representation that the amendment does not contain disclosures that would render it ineligible to become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.
