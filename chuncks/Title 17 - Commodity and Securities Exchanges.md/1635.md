## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 11 - RULES RELATING TO INVESTIGATIONS
#### ยง 11.7 Rights of witnesses.
##### Immunity.

(2)If the Commission believes that the testimony or other information sought to be obtained from any individual may be necessary to the public interest and that individual has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, the Commission, with the approval of the Attorney General, may issue an order requiring the individual to give testimony or provide other information which he previously refused to give on the basis of self-incrimination. Whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in an investigation under this part, and the person presiding over the investigation communicates to the witness an order issued by the Commission requiring the witness to give testimony or provide other information, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination; but no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.
