(5)The Office of the General Counsel has the authority to grant or deny all appeals, in whole or in part. In appropriate cases the Office of the General Counsel may refer appeals to the Commission for determination. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing on appeal is provided. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Office of FOIA Services ordinarily will send the requester an acknowledgment letter that confirms receipt of the requester's appeal.
