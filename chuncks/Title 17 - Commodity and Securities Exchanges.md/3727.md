## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 40 - PROVISIONS COMMON TO REGISTERED ENTITIES
#### ยง 40.10 Special certification procedures for submission of rules by systemically important derivatives clearing organizations.
##### Materiality.

(b)The term "materially affect the nature or level of risks presented," when used to qualify determinations on a change to rules, procedures, or operations of a systemically important derivatives clearing organization, means matters as to which there is a reasonable possibility that the change could affect the performance of essential clearing and settlement functions or the overall nature or level of risk presented by the systemically important derivatives clearing organization. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes that materially affect financial resources, participant and product eligibility, risk management (including matters relating to margin and stress testing), daily or intraday settlement procedures, default procedures, system safeguards (business continuity and disaster recovery), and governance. If a systemically important derivatives clearing organization determines that a proposed change is not material and therefore does not file an advance notice under this ยง 40.10, but the Commission determines that the change is material, the Commission may require the systemically important derivatives clearing organization to withdraw the proposed change and provide notice pursuant to this section.
