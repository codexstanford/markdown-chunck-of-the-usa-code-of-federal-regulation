### PART 45 - SWAP DATA RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
#### ยง 45.10 Reporting to a single swap data repository.
##### Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market.

(a)To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market is reported to a single swap data repository:

(1) The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data for a swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit to both counterparties to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.

(2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to that same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
