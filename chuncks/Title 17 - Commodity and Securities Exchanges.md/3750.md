#### Appendix D to Part 40 - Submission Cover Sheet and Instructions
##### Other Requirements

(b)-A submission shall comply with all applicable filing requirements for proposed rules, rule amendments, or products. The filing of the submission cover sheet does not obviate the registered entity's responsibility to comply with applicable filing requirements (e.g., rules submitted for Commission approval under ยง 40.5 must be accompanied by an explanation of the purpose and effect of the proposed rule along with a description of any substantive opposing views).

(c) Checking the box marked "confidential treatment requested" on the Submission Cover Sheet does not obviate the submitter's responsibility to comply with all applicable requirements for requesting confidential treatment in ยง 40.8 and, where appropriate, ยง 145.9 of this chapter, and will not substitute for notice or full compliance with such requirements.
