() Ensure that the price discovery function of the underlying market is not disrupted;

(iii) Consider implementing safeguards to ensure that when granting spread transaction exemptions, especially during the spot period, the exchange is able to comply with all statutory and regulatory obligations, including the requirements of:

(A) DCM Core Principle 2 and SEF Core Principle 2, as applicable, to, among other things, prohibit abusive trading practices on its markets by members and market participants, and prohibit any other manipulative or disruptive trading practices prohibited by the Act or Commission regulations;

(B) DCM Core Principle 4 and SEF Core Principle 4, as applicable, to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the delivery or cash-settlement process through market surveillance, compliance, and enforcement practices and procedures;

(C) DCM Core Principle 5 and SEF Core Principle 6, as applicable, to implement exchange-set position limits in a manner that reduces the potential threat of market manipulation or congestion; and

(D) DCM Core Principle 12, as applicable, to protect markets and market participants from abusive practices committed by any party, including abusive practices committed by a party acting as an agent for a participant; and to promote fair and equitable trading on the contract market;

(iv) Ensure that any spread exemption transaction does not impede convergence or facilitate the formation of artificial prices; and

(v) Provide a cap or limit on the maximum size of all gross positions permitted under the spread transaction exemption.

(2) The Commission reminds market participants that when utilizing a spread transaction exemption, compliance with Federal speculative position limits or an exemption thereto does not confer any type of safe harbor or good faith defense to a claim that the participant has engaged in an attempted or perfected manipulation or willfully circumvented or evaded speculative position limits, consistent with the Commission's anti-evasion provision in ยง 150.2(i).
