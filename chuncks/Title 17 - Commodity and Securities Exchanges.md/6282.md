###### Referral.

(ii)When the Office of FOIA Services receives a request for a record (or a portion thereof) in its possession that originated with another Federal agency subject to the FOIA, the Office of FOIA Services will typically refer the record to that agency for direct response to the requester. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Office of FOIA Services and the originating agency jointly agree that the Office of FOIA Services is in the best position to make a disclosure determination regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation and processed by the Office of FOIA Services. Whenever the Office of FOIA Services refers a record to another Federal agency for direct response to the requester, the Office of FOIA Services shall notify the requester in writing of the referral and inform the requester of the name of the agency to which the record was referred.
