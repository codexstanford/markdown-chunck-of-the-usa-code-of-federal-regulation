(iii) Every broker or dealer that neither clears transactions nor carries customer accounts and that is not registered as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant under section 15F of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78-10) must file with the Commission an executed Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) within 17 business days after the end of each calendar quarter and within 17 business days after the end of the fiscal year of the broker or dealer where that date is not the end of a calendar quarter.

(iv) Upon receiving written notice from the Commission or the examining authority designated pursuant to section 17(d) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q(d)) ("designated examining authority"), a broker or dealer who receives such notice must file with the Commission on a monthly basis, or at such times as will be specified, an executed Part II or Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter), and such other financial or operational information as will be required by the Commission or the designated examining authority.

(2) The reports provided for in this paragraph (a) that must be filed with the Commission will be considered filed when received at the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC, and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the broker or dealer has its principal place of business. All reports filed pursuant to this paragraph (a) will be deemed to be confidential.

(3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply to a member of a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association if said exchange or association maintains records containing the information required by Part I, Part II, or Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter), as to such member, and transmits to the Commission a copy of the applicable parts of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) as to such member, pursuant to a plan, the procedures and provisions of which have been submitted to and declared effective by the Commission. Any such plan filed by a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association may provide that when a member is also a member of one or more national securities exchanges, or of one or more national securities exchanges and a registered national securities association, the information required to be submitted with respect to any such member may be submitted by only one specified national securities exchange or registered national securities association. For the purposes of this section, a plan filed with the Commission by a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association will not become effective unless the Commission, having due regard for the fulfillment of the Commission's duties and responsibilities under the provisions of the Act, declares the plan to be effective. Further, the Commission, in declaring any such plan effective, may impose such terms and conditions relating to the provisions of the plan and the period of its effectiveness as may be deemed necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or to carry out the Commission's duties and responsibilities under the Act.

(4) Every broker or dealer subject to this paragraph (a) must file Form Custody (§ 249.639 of this chapter) with its designated examining authority within 17 business days after the end of each calendar quarter and within 17 business days after the end of the fiscal year of the broker or dealer where that date is not the end of a calendar quarter. The designated examining authority must maintain the information obtained through the filing of Form Custody and must promptly transmit that information to the Commission at such time as it transmits the applicable part of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
