###### Multitrack processing.

(4)The Office of FOIA Services shall use a multitrack system for processing FOIA requests. The Office of FOIA Services shall designate one track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The Office of FOIA Services shall use two or more additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work and/or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the Office of FOIA Services may consider are the time to perform a search, the number of pages that must be reviewed in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. The Office of FOIA Services shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow the scope of their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.
