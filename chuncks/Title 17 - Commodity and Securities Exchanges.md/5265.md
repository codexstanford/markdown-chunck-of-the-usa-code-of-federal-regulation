### PART 150 - LIMITS ON POSITIONS
#### ยง 150.9 Process for recognizing non-enumerated bona fide hedging transactions or positions with respect to Federal speculative position limits.
##### Commission stay of pending applications and requests for additional information.

(5)The Commission may stay an application that requires additional time to analyze, and/or may request additional information to determine whether the position for which the application is submitted meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The Commission shall notify the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant of a Commission determination to stay the application and/or request any supplemental information, and shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to respond. The Commission will have an additional 45 days from the date of the stay notification to conduct the review and issue a determination with respect to the application. If the Commission stays an application and the applicant has not yet exceeded Federal speculative position limits, then the applicant may not exceed Federal speculative position limits unless the Commission approves the application. If the Commission stays an application and the applicant has already exceeded Federal speculative position limits, then the applicant may continue to maintain the position unless the Commission notifies the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant otherwise, pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
