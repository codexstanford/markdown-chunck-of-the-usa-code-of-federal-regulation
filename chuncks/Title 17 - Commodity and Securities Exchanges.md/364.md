(i) With respect to a Material Affiliated Person organized as a mutual insurance company or a non-public stock company, the futures commission merchant or such Material Affiliated Person maintains in accordance with § 1.14 copies of the annual statements with schedules and exhibits prepared by the Material Affiliated Person on forms prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or by a state insurance commissioner; and

(ii) With respect to a Material Affiliated Person organized as a public stock company, the futures commission merchant or such Material Affiliated Person maintains, in addition to the annual statements with schedules and exhibits required to be maintained pursuant to § 1.14, copies of the filings made by the Material Affiliated Person pursuant to sections 13 or 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

(4) No futures commission merchant shall be required to furnish to the Commission any examination report of any Federal banking agency or any supervisory recommendations or analyses contained therein with respect to a Material Affiliated Person that is subject to the regulation of a Federal banking agency. All information received by the Commission pursuant to this section concerning a Material Affiliated Person that is subject to examination by or the reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency shall be deemed confidential for the purposes of section 8 of the Act.

(5) The furnishing of any information or documents by a futures commission merchant pursuant to this section shall not constitute an admission for any purpose that a Material Affiliated Person is otherwise subject to the Act.
