(iii) The nature or date of the statutory disqualification,

(iv) The post-conviction modification of any record of conviction, or

(2)(i) In the response, if the person is not an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, the applicant or registrant shall also state whether he or she intends to show that registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the disqualification set forth in the notice. If the person is an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, the applicant or registrant shall also state whether he or she intends to show that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the disqualification set forth in the notice. If the person is an associated person or an applicant for registration as an associated person and intends to make such a showing, he or she must also submit a letter signed by an officer or general partner authorized to bind the sponsor whereby the sponsor agrees to sign a Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement and supervise compliance with any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed on the applicant or registrant as a result of a statutory disqualification proceeding under this section; if the person is a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in either capacity and intends to make such a showing, he or she must, in the case of a floor broker or applicant for registration as a floor broker, also submit a letter signed by his employer or if he or she has no employer by another floor broker or, in the case of a floor trader or applicant for registration as a floor trader, also submit a letter signed by an officer of the floor trader's clearing member, if such officer is a registrant or a principal of a registrant, or the chief operating officer of each contract market or swap execution facility that has granted trading privileges, whereby the employer or floor broker, appropriate registrant, principal or chief operating officer (on behalf of the contract market or swap execution facility) agrees to sign a Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement and supervise compliance with any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed on the applicant or registrant as a result of a statutory disqualification proceeding under this section; provided, that, with respect to such sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, supervising registrant or principal:

(A) An adjudicatory proceeding pursuant to the provisions of sections 6(c), 6(d), 6c, 6d, 8a or 9 of the Act is not pending; and

(B) In the case of a sponsor which is a futures commission merchant, a retail foreign exchange dealer or a leverage transaction merchant, the sponsor is not subject to the reporting requirements of § 1.12(b), § 5.6(b) or § 31.7(b) of this chapter, respectively; and

(C) Such person is not barred from service on self-regulatory organization governing boards or committees based on disciplinary history in accordance with § 1.63 of this chapter.

(ii) If, in the response, the applicant or registrant states that he intends to make the showing referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, he shall also, within fifteen days after filing his initial response under paragraph (b) of this section, file with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy on the Division of Enforcement a submission which includes a statement of the applicant, registrant or his attorney identifying and summarizing the testimony of each witness whom the applicant or registrant intends to have testify in support of facts material to his showing, and copies of all documents which the applicant or registrant intends to introduce to support facts material to his showing. The factors forming the basis for a disqualified applicant's or registrant's showing referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may include:

(A) Evidence mitigating the seriousness of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice;

(B) Evidence that the applicant or registrant has undergone rehabilitation since the time of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification; and

(C) If the person is an associated person, floor broker or floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, evidence that the applicant's or registrant's registration on a conditioned or restricted basis would be subject to supervisory controls likely both to detect future wrongdoing by the applicant or registrant and protect the public from any harm arising from the applicant's or registrant's future wrongdoing, including proposed conditions or restrictions.
