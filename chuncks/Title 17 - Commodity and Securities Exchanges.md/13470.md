##### Public disclosure.

(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an issuer shall make the "public disclosure" of information required by ยง 243.100(a) by furnishing to or filing with the Commission a Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) disclosing that information.

(2) An issuer shall be exempt from the requirement to furnish or file a Form 8-K if it instead disseminates the information through another method (or combination of methods) of disclosure that is reasonably designed to provide broad, non-exclusionary distribution of the information to the public.
