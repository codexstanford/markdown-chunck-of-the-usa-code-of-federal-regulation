### PART 150 - LIMITS ON POSITIONS
#### ยง 150.9 Process for recognizing non-enumerated bona fide hedging transactions or positions with respect to Federal speculative position limits.
##### Commission revocation of applications previously approved.

(f)(1) If a designated contract market or a swap execution facility limits, conditions, or revokes any recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position for purposes of the respective designated contract market's or swap execution facility's speculative position limits established under ยง 150.5(a), then such recognition will also be deemed limited, conditioned, or revoked for purposes of Federal speculative position limits.

(2) If the Commission determines, at any time, that a position that has been recognized as a bona fide hedging transaction or position for purposes of Federal speculative position limits is no longer consistent with section 4a(c)(2) of the Act or the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in ยง 150.1, the following applies:

(i) The Commission shall notify the person holding the position and the relevant designated contract market or swap execution facility. After providing such person and such designated contract market or swap execution facility an opportunity to respond, the Commission may, in its discretion, limit, condition, or revoke its determination for purposes of Federal speculative position limits and require the person to reduce the derivatives position within a commercially reasonable time as determined by the Commission in consultation with such person and such designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise come into compliance;

(ii) The Commission shall include in its notification a brief explanation of the nature of the issues raised and the specific provisions of the Act or the Commission's regulations with which the position or application is, or appears to be, inconsistent; and

(iii) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the Commission's review, nor once the Commission has issued its determination, provided the person submitted the application in good faith and reduces the position within a commercially reasonable time, as determined by the Commission in consultation with such person and the relevant designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise comes into compliance.
