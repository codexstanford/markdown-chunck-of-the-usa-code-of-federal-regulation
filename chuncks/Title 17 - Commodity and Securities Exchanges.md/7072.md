###### Requests for offset from other Federal agencies.

(d)Any Federal agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the Commission be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to such Federal agency by the debtor. The Commission shall initiate the requested offset only upon:

(1) Receipt of written certification from the crecitor agency that:

(i) The debtor owes the past due and legally enforceable debt; and

(ii) The debtor has been afforded the necessary due process rights.

(2) A determination by the Commission that collection by offset against funds payable by the Commission would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.
