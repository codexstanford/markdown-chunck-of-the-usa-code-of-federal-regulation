#### Appendix B to Part 162 - Interagency Guidelines on Identity Theft Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation

Section 162.30 requires each financial institution or creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as defined in ยง 162.30(b)(3), to develop and provide for the continued administration of a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing covered account. These guidelines are intended to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and maintenance of an Identity Theft Prevention Program that satisfies the requirements of ยง 162.30.

In designing its Identity Theft Prevention Program, a financial institution or creditor may incorporate, as appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements that control reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.
