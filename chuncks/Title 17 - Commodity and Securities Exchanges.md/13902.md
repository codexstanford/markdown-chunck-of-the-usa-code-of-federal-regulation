(d)(1) You may satisfy the initial notice requirements in §§ 248.4(a)(2), 248.7(b), and 248.7(c) for a consumer who is not a customer by providing a short-form initial notice at the same time as you deliver an opt out notice as required in § 248.7.

(i) Be clear and conspicuous;

(ii) State that your privacy notice is available upon request; and

(iii) Explain a reasonable means by which the consumer may obtain the privacy notice.
