###### Determinations on appeals.

(6)A determination on an appeal must be made in writing. A determination that denies an appeal, in whole or in part, shall include a brief explanation of the basis for the denial, identify the applicable FOIA exemptions asserted, and describe why the exemptions apply. As applicable, the determination will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4), and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Office of FOIA Services' determination is remanded or modified on appeal, the Office of the General Counsel will notify the requester of that determination in writing.
