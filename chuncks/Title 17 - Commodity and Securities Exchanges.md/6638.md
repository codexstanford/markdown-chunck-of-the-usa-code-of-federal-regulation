####### Length limitation.

(c)No motion (together with the brief in support of the motion), brief in opposition to the motion, or reply brief shall exceed 7,000 words, exclusive of any table of contents or table of authorities. The word limit shall not apply to any addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions or rules, or relevant exhibits. Requests for leave to file motions and briefs in excess of 7,000 words are disfavored. A motion or brief, together with any accompanying brief, that does not exceed 15 pages in length, exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, table of authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions, or rules and exhibits, but inclusive of pleadings incorporated by reference, is presumptively considered to contain no more than 7,000 words. Any motion or brief that exceeds these page limits must include a certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented party, stating that the document complies with the length limitation set forth in this paragraph and stating the number of words in the document. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word count of a word-processing program to prepare the document.
