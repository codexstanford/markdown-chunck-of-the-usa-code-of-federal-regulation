##### Third-party service providers.

(5)If a reporting counterparty informs a swap data repository that the reporting counterparty will utilize a third-party service provider to perform verification as required pursuant to ยง 45.14 of this chapter, the swap data repository will satisfy its requirements under this section by providing the third-party service provider with the same access to the mechanism and the relevant swap data for the reporting counterparty under this section, as if the third-party service provider was the reporting counterparty. The access for the third-party service provider shall be in addition to the access for the reporting counterparty required under this section. The access for the third-party service provider under this paragraph shall continue until the reporting counterparty informs the swap data repository that the third-party service provider should no longer have access on behalf of the reporting counterparty. The policies and procedures each swap data repository adopts under paragraph (c) of this section shall include instructions detailing how each reporting counterparty can successfully inform the swap data repository regarding a third-party service provider.
