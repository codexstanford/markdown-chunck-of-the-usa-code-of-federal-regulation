###### Use of depositions at hearing.

(g)(1) Any part or all of a deposition, to the extent admissible under rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying at the hearing, may be used against any party who had reasonable notice of the taking of the deposition, if the Administrative Law Judge finds that:

(i) The witness is dead;

(ii) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;

(iii) The witness is out of the United States at the time of the hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.

(2) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.

(3) Objection may be made at a hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.
