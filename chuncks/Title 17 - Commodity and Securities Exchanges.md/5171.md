### PART 150 - LIMITS ON POSITIONS
#### ยง 150.1 Definitions.
##### Speculative position limit

means the maximum position, either net long or net short, in a commodity derivative contract that may be held or controlled by one person absent an exemption, whether such limits are adopted for:

(1) Combined positions in all commodity derivative contracts in a particular commodity, including the spot month futures contract and all single month futures contracts (the spot month and all single month futures contracts, cumulatively, "all-months-combined");

(2) Positions in a single month of commodity derivative contracts in a particular commodity other than the spot month futures contract ("single month"); or

(3) Positions in the spot month of commodity derivative contacts in a particular commodity. Such a limit may be established under Federal regulations or rules of a designated contract market or swap execution facility. For referenced contracts other than core referenced futures contracts, single month means the same period as that of the relevant core referenced futures contract.
