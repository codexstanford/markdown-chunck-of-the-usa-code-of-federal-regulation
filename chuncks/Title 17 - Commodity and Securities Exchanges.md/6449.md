The Commission may exclude any person from attendance at any meeting whenever necessary to preserve decorum, or where appropriate or necessary for health or safety reasons, or where necessary to terminate behavior unauthorized by this paragraph (a). Any person desiring to sound-record an open Commission meeting shall notify the Commission's Secretary of his intention to do so at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting in question. Any person desiring to photograph or videotape the Commission's proceedings may apply to the Secretary for permission to do so at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting in question. The Commission's determination to permit photography or videotaping at any meeting is confined to its exclusive discretion, and will be granted only if such activities will not result in undue disruption of Commission proceedings.
