(3) Any electronic storage media that you use to store your records must:

The independent escrow agent must file an undertaking signed by a duly authorized person with the Commission and your ARA stating that:

(6) (i) If you use a third party to maintain or preserve some or all of the required records using electronic storage media or micrographic media, such third party shall file a written undertaking signed by a duly authorized person with the Commission and your ARA stating that:

(ii) Agreement with a third party to maintain your records shall not relieve you from the responsibility to prepare and maintain records as specified in this section or in § 240.17Ad-6.

(g) If the records required to be maintained and preserved by a registered transfer agent pursuant to the requirements of §§ 240.17Ad-6 and 240.17Ad-7 are maintained and preserved on behalf of the registered transfer agent by an outside service bureau, other recordkeeping service or the issuer, the registered transfer agent shall obtain, from such outside service bureau, other recordkeeping service or the issuer, an agreement, in writing, to the effect that:
