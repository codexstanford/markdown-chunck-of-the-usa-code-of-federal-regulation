#### ยง 5.10 Risk assessment recordkeeping requirements for retail foreign exchange dealers.
##### Location of records.

(e)A retail foreign exchange dealer required to maintain records concerning Material Affiliated Persons pursuant to this section may maintain those records either at the principal office of the Material Affiliated Person or at a records storage facility, provided that, except as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the records are located within the boundaries of the United States and the records are kept and available for inspection in accordance with ยง 1.31 of this chapter. If such records are maintained at a place other than the retail foreign exchange dealer's principal place of business, the Material Affiliated Person or other entity maintaining the records shall file with the Commission a written undertaking, in a form acceptable to the Commission, signed by a duly authorized person, to the effect that the records will be treated as if the retail foreign exchange dealer were maintaining the records pursuant to this section and that the entity maintaining the records will permit examination of such records at any time, or from time to time during business hours, by representatives or designees of the Commission and promptly furnish the Commission representative or its designee true, correct, complete and current hard copy of all or any part of such records. The election to maintain records at the principal place of business of the Material Affiliated Person or at a records storage facility pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall not relieve the retail foreign exchange dealer required to maintain and preserve such records from any of its responsibilities under this section or ยง 5.11 of this part.
