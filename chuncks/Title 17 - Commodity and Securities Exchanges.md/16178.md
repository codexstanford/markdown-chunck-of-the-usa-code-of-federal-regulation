###### Delivery or disposition of securities.

"(l)Nothing stated in this section shall be construed as affecting the absolute right of a customer of a government securities broker or dealer, unless otherwise agreed in writing, in the normal course of business operations following demand made on the broker or dealer, to receive the physical delivery of certificates if the securities are issued in certificated form, or to direct a transfer of or otherwise to exercise control over any securities if they are:

"(1) Fully-paid securities to which the customer is entitled;

"(2) Margin securities upon full payment by such customer to the broker or dealer of the customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer; or

"(3) Excess margin securities not reasonably required to collateralize such customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer.".

(k) Except with respect to a government securities interdealer broker subject to the financial responsibility requirements of § 402.1(e) and a registered government securities broker or dealer that is a futures commission merchant registered with the CFTC, § 240.15c3-3(e)(3) is modified for purposes of this section to read as follows:

"(3) Computations necessary to determine the amount required to be deposited as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be made weekly, as of the close of the last business day of the week, and the deposit so computed shall be made no later than 1 hour after the opening of banking business on the second following business day; provided, however, a government securities broker or dealer registered pursuant to section 15C(a)(1)(A) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5 (a)(1)(A)) which has a ratio of liquid capital to total haircuts (calculated in accordance with part 402 of this chapter) of 1.8 or greater and which carries aggregate customer funds (as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section), as computed at the last required computation pursuant to this section, not exceeding $1 million, may in the alternative make the computation monthly, as of the close of the last business day of the month, and, in such event, shall deposit not less than 105 percent of the amount so computed no later than 1 hour after the opening of banking business on the second following business day. If a registered government securities broker or dealer, computing on a monthly basis, has, at the time of any required computation, a ratio of liquid capital to total haircuts of less than 1.8, such broker or dealer shall thereafter compute weekly as aforesaid until four successive weekly computations are made, none of which were made at a time when its ratio of liquid capital to total haircuts was less than 1.8. Computations in addition to the computation required in this paragraph (3), may be made as of the close of any other business day, and the deposits so computed shall be made no later than 1 hour after the opening of banking business on the second following business day. The registered government securities broker or dealer shall make and maintain a record of each such computation made pursuant to this paragraph (3) or otherwise and preserve such record in accordance with § 240.17a-4.".

(l) Except with respect to a government securities interdealer broker subject to the financial responsibility requirements of § 402.1(e) and a registered government securities broker or dealer that is a futures commission merchant registered with the CFTC, Note E(5) of § 240.15c3-3a of this title is modified for purposes of this section to read as follows:

"(5) Debit balances in margin accounts (other than omnibus accounts) shall be reduced by the amount by which any single customer's debit balance exceeds 25% (to the extent such amount is greater than $50,000) of the government securities broker's or dealer's liquid capital unless such broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to credit items in the Reserve Formula. Related accounts (e.g., the separate accounts of an individual, accounts under common control or subject to cross guarantees) shall be deemed to be a single customer's accounts for purposes of this provision.".

(m) For purposes of this section, the suspension of § 240.15c3-3(m) of this title (38 FR 12103, May 9, 1973) is no longer effective and the paragraph is modified to read as follows: "(m) If a government securities broker or government securities dealer executes a sell order of a customer (other than an order to execute a sale of securities which the seller does not own, which for the purposes of this paragraph shall mean that the customer placing the sell order has identified the sale as a short sale to the government securities broker or dealer) and if for any reason whatever the government securities broker or government securities dealer has not obtained possession of the government securities, other than mortgage-backed securities, from the customer within 30 calendar days, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities within 60 calendar days, after the settlement date, the government securities broker or government securities dealer shall immediately thereafter close the transaction with the customer by purchasing, or otherwise obtaining, securities of like kind and quantity. For purposes of this paragraph (m), the term "customer" shall not include a broker or dealer who maintains a special omnibus account with another broker or dealer in compliance with section 4(b) of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.4(b)).
