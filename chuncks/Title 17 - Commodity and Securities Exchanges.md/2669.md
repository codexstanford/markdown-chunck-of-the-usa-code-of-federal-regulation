##### Additional contracts on previously-reviewed index:

(m)A new non-narrow-based security index futures contract may be offered or sold in the U.S. in reliance on a prior Foreign Security Index No-Action Letter or Commission certification, provided that the new contract is based on an index that was the subject of such Foreign Security Index No-Action Letter or Commission certification; and substantially identical to the contract overlying such index. In this context, the foreign board of trade may submit the contract to the Commission for an accelerated review of fifteen business days for confirmation that the subject contract is substantially identical to the existing contract. Unless the Commission notifies the foreign board of trade within those fifteen business days that the review will be conducted pursuant to either the full or expedited review procedure, the foreign board of trade may make available such contract for offer or sale within the U.S.
