#### Subpart A - Privacy and Opt Out Notices
##### § 160.6 Information to be included in privacy notices.
###### Short-form initial notice with opt out notice for non-customers.

(d)(1) You may satisfy the initial notice requirements in §§ 160.4(a)(2), 160.7(b) and 160.7(c) for a consumer who is not a customer by providing a short-form initial notice at the same time as you deliver an opt out notice as required in 160.7.

(2) A short-form initial notice must:

(i) Be clear and conspicuous;

(ii) State that your privacy notice is available upon request; and

(iii) Explain a reasonable means by which the consumer may obtain your privacy notice.

(3) You must deliver your short-form initial notice according to § 160.9. You are not required to deliver your privacy notice with your short-form initial notice. You instead may simply provide the consumer a reasonable means to obtain your privacy notice. If a consumer who receives your short-form notice requests your privacy notice, you must deliver your privacy notice according to § 160.9.
