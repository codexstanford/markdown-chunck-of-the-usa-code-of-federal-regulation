###### Government securities interdealer broker

(2)(i)means an entity engaged exclusively in business as a broker that effects, on an initially fully disclosed or identified group basis, transactions in government securities for counterparties that are government securities brokers or dealers who have registered or given notice pursuant to section 15C(a)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(1)), and that promptly transmits all funds and delivers all securities received in connection with its activities as a government securities interdealer broker and does not otherwise hold funds or securities for or owe money or securities to its counterparties and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, does not have or maintain any government securities in its proprietary or other accounts. For the purpose of this paragraph (e)(2)(i), "identified group basis" means that a counterparty has consented to the identity of the specific group of entities from which the other counterparty is chosen.

(ii) A government securities interdealer broker may have or maintain government securities in its proprietary or other accounts only as a result of:

(A) Engaging in overnight reverse repurchase or securities borrowed transactions solely for the purpose of facilitating the process of clearing government securities transactions;

(B) Engaging in overnight repurchase or securities loaned transactions solely for the purpose of reducing its financing expense in connection with the clearance of government securities transactions;

(C) Subordinated loans subject to satisfactory subordination agreements pursuant to § 240.l5c3-1(d) of this title;

(D) Collateral or depository requirements of a clearing corporation or association with which it participates in the clearance of government securities transactions; or

(E) The investment of its excess cash.

(3) In order to qualify to operate under this paragraph (e), a government securities interdealer broker shall at all times have and maintain net capital, as defined in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2) of this title with the modifications of this paragraph (e), of not less than $1,000,000.

(4) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities interdealer broker need not deduct loans to commercial banks for one business day of immediately available funds (commonly referred to as "sales of federal funds") held by the government securities interdealer broker in connection with the clearance of securities on the day the loan is made.

(5) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities interdealer broker need not deduct net pair-off receivables and money differences until the close of business of the third business day following the day the funds are due and give-up receivables outstanding no more than 30 days from the billing date, which shall be no later than the last day of the month in which they arise, as otherwise would be required under § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(B) of this title.

(6) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities interdealer broker shall deduct from net worthof 1 percent of the contract value of each government securities failed-to-deliver contract which is outstanding 5 business days or longer. Such deduction shall be increased by any excess of the contract price of the failed-to-deliver contract over the market value of the underlying security.

(7) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities interdealer broker may exclude from its aggregate indebtedness computation indebtedness adequately collateralized by government securities outstanding for not more than one business day and offset by government securities failed to deliver of the same issue and quantity. In no event may a government securities interdealer broker exclude any overnight bank loan attributable to the same government securities failed-to-deliver contract for more than one business day. A government securities interdealer broker need not deduct from net worth the amount by which the market value of securities failed to receive outstanding longer than thirty (30) calendar days exceeds the contract value of those failed to receive as required by § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(E) of this title.

(8)(i) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities interdealer broker shall deduct from net worth 5 percent of its net exposure to each counterparty.
