() Discuss the uncertainty in the estimates of inferred, indicated, and measured mineral resources, and explain the sources of uncertainty and how they were considered in the uncertainty estimates. The qualified person must consider all sources of uncertainty associated with each class of mineral resources. Sources of uncertainty that affect such reporting of uncertainty include sampling or drilling methods, data processing and handling, geologic modeling, and estimation. The qualified person must support the disclosure of uncertainty associated with each class of mineral resources with a list of all factors considered and explain how those factors contributed to the final conclusion about the level of uncertainty underlying the resource estimates. The qualified person is not required to use estimates of confidence limits derived from geostatistics or other numerical methods to support the disclosure of uncertainty surrounding mineral resource classification. If the qualified person chooses to use confidence limit estimates from geostatistics or other numerical methods, he or she should consider the limitations of these methods and adjust the estimates appropriately to reflect sources of uncertainty that are not accounted for by these methods;
