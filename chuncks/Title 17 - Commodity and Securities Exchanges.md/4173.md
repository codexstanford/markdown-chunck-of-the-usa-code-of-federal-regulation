### PART 45 - SWAP DATA RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
#### ยง 45.10 Reporting to a single swap data repository.
##### Procedure.

(2)After providing the notifications required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the reporting counterparty shall follow paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section to complete the change of swap data repository.

(i) The reporting counterparty shall report the change of swap data repository to the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty is currently reporting swap transaction and pricing data and swap data as a life cycle event for such swap pursuant to ยง 45.4.

(ii) On the same day that the reporting counterparty reports required swap continuation data as required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the reporting counterparty shall also report the change of swap data repository to the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data will be reported going forward as a life cycle event for such swap pursuant to ยง 45.4. The required swap continuation data report shall identify the swap using the same unique transaction identifier used to identify the swap at the previous swap data repository.

(iii) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to the same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty for the swap makes another change to the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
