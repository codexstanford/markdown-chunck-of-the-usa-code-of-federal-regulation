##### Non-reporting counterparties.

(2)Any non-reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error in the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap to which it is the non-reporting counterparty, shall notify the reporting counterparty for the swap of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but not later than three business days following discovery of the error.

Such notice from the non-reporting counterparty to the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty constitutes discovery under this section.
