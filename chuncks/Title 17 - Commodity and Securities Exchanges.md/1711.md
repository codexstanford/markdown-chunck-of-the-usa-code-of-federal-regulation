###### Determination not to forward complaint.

(b)The Director may, in their discretion, refuse to forward a complaint as to a particular respondent if it appears that the matters alleged therein are not cognizable in reparations, or that grounds exist pursuant to ยง 12.24(c) or (d) for refusing to forward the complaint. If the Director of the Office of Proceedings should determine not to forward the complaint to all registrants named in the complaint in accordance with this section, no proceeding shall be held thereon and the complainant shall be notified to that effect. If the Director determines to forward the complaint as to less than all of the registrants, the complainant shall be so notified. A termination of the complaint as to any registrant shall be regarded by the Commission as without prejudice to the right of the complainant to seek such alternative forms of relief as may be available.
