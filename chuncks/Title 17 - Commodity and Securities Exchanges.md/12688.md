##### Preliminary information statement.

(a)Five preliminary copies of the information statement shall be filed with the Commission at least 10 calendar days prior to the date definitive copies of such statement are first sent or given to security holders, or such shorter period prior to that date as the Commission may authorize upon a showing of good cause therefor. In computing the 10-day period, the filing date of the preliminary copies is to be counted as the first day and the 11th day is the date on which definitive copies of the information statement may be sent to security holders.

(1) The election of directors;

(2) The election, approval or ratification of accountant(s);

(3) A security holder proposal identified in the registrant's information statement pursuant to Item 4 of Schedule 14C (ยง 240.14c-101); and/or

(4) The approval or ratification of a plan as defined in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of Item 402 of Regulation S-K (ยง 229.402(a)(6)(ii) of this chapter) or amendments to such a plan.
