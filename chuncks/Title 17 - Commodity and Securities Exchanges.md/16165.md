### Subchapter A - Regulations Under Section 15C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
#### PART 402 - FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
##### § 402.2a Appendix A - Calculation of market risk haircut for purposes of § 402.2(g)(2).
###### Other securities haircut.

(b)The "other securities haircut" equals the sum of all deductions specified in § 240.15c3-1 (c)(2)(vi) and (c)(2)(viii) of this title and §§ 240.15c3-1a and 240.l5c3-1b of this title for long and short positions in securities, futures contracts, forward contracts, options, and other inventory which are not Treasury market risk instruments as defined in § 402.2(e).

(1) A registered government securities broker or dealer may elect to exclude from its calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut and include in its calculation of the other securities haircut long and short positions in Treasury market risk instruments if such positions form part of a hedge against long and short positions in securities, futures contracts, forward contracts, or options which are not Treasury market risk instruments. Only the portion of the total position in a Treasury market risk instrument that forms part of such hedge may be excluded from the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut and included in the calculation of the other securities haircut.

(2) For purposes of this paragraph (b), a gross long or short position in Treasury market risk instruments shall be considered part of a hedge if the inclusion of such position in the calculation of the other securities haircut would serve to reduce said haircut.

(3) For purposes of this paragraph (b) as it relates to § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(M) ("undue concentration"), references to "10 percent of the "net capital'" shall be understood to refer to 10 percent of the liquid capital and references to "Appendix (D) (17 CFR 240.15c3-1d)" shall be understood to refer to such section as modified by § 402.2d.
