###### Substantiation of request for confidential treatment.

(d)(1) If it is determined that records which are the subject of a request for access under the Freedom of Information Act are also the subject of a request for confidential treatment under this rule and no other grounds appear to exist which would justify the withholding of the records [e.g., Freedom of Information Act Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A)], the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer promptly shall so inform the person requesting confidential treatment or, in the case of a request made on behalf of a person other than the submitter, the person identified as able to provide substantiation, by telephone, facsimile or certified mail and require that substantiation of the request for confidential treatment be submitted in ten calendar days. Failure to submit a written substantiation within ten calendar days from the time of notification, or any extension thereof, may be deemed a waiver of the confidential treatment request and the confidential treatment requester's right to appeal an initial decision denying confidential treatment to the Commission's General Counsel as permitted by paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) Substantiation of a request for confidential treatment shall consist of a statement setting forth, to the extent appropriate or necessary for the determination of the request for confidential treatment, the following information regarding the request:

(i) The reasons, concisely stated and referring to specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, why the information should be withheld from access under the Freedom of Information Act;

(ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory provisions which govern or may govern the treatment of the information;

(iii) The existence and applicability of any prior determinations by the Commission, other Federal agencies, or a court, concerning confidential treatment of the information;

(iv) The adverse consequences to a business enterprise, financial or otherwise, that would result from disclosure of confidential commercial or financial information, including any adverse effect on the business' competitive position;

(v) The measures taken by the business to protect the confidentiality of the commercial or financial information in question and of similar information, prior to, and after, its submission to the Commission;

(vi) The ease or difficulty of a competitor's obtaining or compiling the commercial or financial information;

(vii) Whether the commercial or financial information was voluntarily submitted to the Commission and, if so, whether and how disclosure of the information would tend to impede the availability of similar information to the Commission;

(viii) The extent, if any, to which portions of the substantiation of the request for confidential treatment should be afforded confidential treatment; and

(ix) Such additional facts and such legal and other authorities as the requesting person may consider appropriate.
