##### ยง 229.1304 (Item 1304) Individual property disclosure.

(a)(1) A registrant must disclose the information specified in this section for each property that is material to its business or financial condition. When determining the materiality of a property relative to its business or financial condition, a registrant must apply the standards and other considerations specified in ยง 229.1301(c) to each individual property that it:

(i) Owns or in which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a direct or indirect economic interest;

(ii) Operates, or it is probable that it will operate, under a lease or other legal agreement that grants the registrant ownership or similar rights that authorize it, as principal, to sell or otherwise dispose of the mineral; or

(iii) Has, or it is probable that it will have, an associated royalty or similar right.

(2) A registrant that has a royalty, streaming or other similar right, but which lacks access to any of the information specified in this section about the underlying property or properties, may omit such information, provided that the registrant:

(i) Specifies the information to which it lacks access;

(ii) Explains that it does not have access to the required information because:

(A) Obtaining the information would result in an unreasonable burden or expense; or

(B) It requested the information from a person possessing knowledge of the information, who is not affiliated with the with the royalty company or similar registrant, and who denied the request; and

(iii) Provides all required information that it does possess or which it can acquire without incurring an unreasonable burden or expense.

(b) Disclose the following information for each material property specified in paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) A brief description of the property including:

(i) The location, accurate to within one mile, using an easily recognizable coordinate system. The registrant must provide appropriate maps, with proper engineering detail (such as scale, orientation, and titles). Such maps must be legible on the page when printed;

(ii) Existing infrastructure including roads, railroads, airports, towns, ports, sources of water, electricity, and personnel; and

(iii) A brief description, including the name or number and size (acreage), of the titles, claims, concessions, mineral rights, leases or options under which the registrant and its subsidiaries have or will have the right to hold or operate the property, and how such rights are obtained at this location, indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet in order to obtain or retain the property. If held by leases or options or if the mineral rights otherwise have termination provisions, the registrant must provide the expiration dates of such leases, options or mineral rights and associated payments.

(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the registrant holds a royalty or similar interest or will have an associated royalty or similar right, the disclosure must describe all of the information in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including, for example, the documents under which the owner or operator holds or operates the property, the mineral rights held by the owner or operator, conditions required to be met by the owner or operator, and the expiration dates of leases, options and mineral rights. The registrant must also briefly describe the agreement under which the registrant and its subsidiaries have or will have the right to a royalty or similar interest in the property, indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet in order to obtain or retain the royalty or similar interest, and indicating the expiration date.

(2) The following information, as relevant to the particular property:

(i) A brief description of the present condition of the property, the work completed by the registrant on the property, the registrant's proposed program of exploration or development, the current stage of the property as exploration, development or production, the current state of exploration or development of the property, and the current production activities. Mines should be identified as either surface or underground, with a brief description of the mining method and processing operations. If the property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature or the registrant has started extraction without determining mineral reserves, the registrant must provide a statement to that effect;

(ii) The age, details as to modernization and physical condition of the equipment, facilities, infrastructure, and underground development;

(iii) The total cost for or book value of the property and its associated plant and equipment;

(iv) A brief history of previous operations, including the names of previous operators, insofar as known; and

(v) A brief description of any significant encumbrances to the property, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.

(c) When providing the disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section:

(1) A registrant must identify an individual property with no mineral reserves as an exploration stage property, even if it has other properties in development or production. Similarly, a registrant that does not have reserves on any of its properties cannot characterize itself as a development or production stage company, even if it has mineral resources or exploration results, or even if it is engaged in extraction without first disclosing mineral reserves.

(2) A registrant should not include extensive description of regional geology. Rather, it should include geological information that is brief and relevant to property disclosure.

(d)(1) If mineral resources or reserves have been determined, the registrant must provide a summary of all mineral resources or reserves as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, which, for each property, discloses in tabular form, as provided in Table 1 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each class of mineral resources (measured, indicated, and inferred), together with total measured and indicated mineral resources, the estimated tonnages and grades (or quality, where appropriate), and as provided in Table 2 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each class of mineral reserves (proven and probable), together with total mineral reserves, the estimated tonnages, grades (or quality, where appropriate), cut-off grades, and metallurgical recovery, based on a specific point of reference selected by a qualified person pursuant to ยง 229.601(b)(96). The registrant must disclose the selected point of reference for each of Tables 1 and 2 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
