(ii)(A) Search fees shall be charged for all requests-other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media-subject to the limitations of paragraph (g)(4) of this section. The Office of FOIA Services may charge for time spent searching even if no responsive records are located or it is determined that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure. Search fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the search by agency employees.

(B) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate or identify responsive records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating and implementing such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

(C) For requests that require the retrieval of agency records stored at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration ("NARA"), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.
