(B) A swap dealer that uses internal models to compute market risk for its proprietary positions under § 240.18a-1(d) of this title must calculate the total market risk as the sum of the VaR measure, stressed VaR measure, specific risk measure, comprehensive risk measure, and incremental risk measure of the portfolio of proprietary positions in accordance with § 23.102 of this part and Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 23; and

(C) A swap dealer may recognize as a current asset, receivables from third-party custodians that maintain the swap dealer's initial margin deposits associated with uncleared swap and security-based swap transactions pursuant to the margin rules of the Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, a prudential regulator, as defined in section 1a(39) of the Act, or a foreign jurisdiction that has received a margin Comparability Determination under § 23.160 of this chapter.

(2)(i) A swap dealer that is "predominantly engaged in non-financial activities" as defined in § 23.100 of this part may elect to meet the minimum capital requirements in this paragraph (a)(2) in lieu of the capital requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(ii) A swap dealer that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and elects to meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) must maintain tangible net worth, as defined in § 23.100 of this part, equal to or in excess of the greatest of the following:

The swap dealer shall compute its market risk exposure requirement and credit risk exposure requirement for its swap positions in accordance with § 23.102 of this part if the swap dealer has obtained approval to use internal capital models. The swap dealer shall compute its market risk exposure requirement and credit risk exposure requirement in accordance with the standardized approach of paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of § 23.103 of this part if it has not been approved to use internal capital models;

(B) Eight percent of the amount of uncleared swap margin, as that term is defined in § 23.100 of this part, for each uncleared swap positions open on the books of the swap dealer, computed on a counterparty by counterparty basis pursuant to § 23.154 of this part; or

(C) The amount of capital required by a registered futures association of which the swap dealer is a member.

(3) A swap dealer that is subject to minimum capital requirements established by the rules or regulations of a prudential regulator pursuant to section 4s(e) of the Act is not subject to the regulatory capital requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

(4) A swap dealer that is a futures commission merchant is subject to the minimum capital requirements of § 1.17 of this title, and is not subject to the regulatory capital requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

In order to qualify for substituted compliance, a swap dealer's home country jurisdiction must receive from the Commission a Capital Comparability Determination under § 23.106 of this part. A swap dealer that is a registered futures commission merchant may not apply for a Capital Comparability Determination and must comply with the minimum capital requirements set forth in § 1.17 of this chapter.

(6) A swap dealer that elects to meet the capital requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), or (a)(2) of this section may not subsequently change its election without the prior written approval of the Commission. A swap dealer that wishes to change its election must submit a written request to the Commission and must provide any additional information and documentation requested by the Commission.

(b)(1) Every major swap participant for which there is not a prudential regulator must at all time have and maintain positive tangible net worth.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, a major swap participant that is a futures commission merchant is subject to the minimum capital requirements of § 1.17 of this chapter, and is not subject to the regulatory capital requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

(4) A major swap participant that is organized and domiciled outside of the United States, including a major swap participant that is an affiliate of a person organized and domiciled in the United States, may satisfy its requirements for capital adequacy under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section by substituted compliance with the capital adequacy requirement of its home country jurisdiction. In order to qualify for substituted compliance, a major swap participant's home country jurisdiction must receive from the Commission a Capital Comparability Determination under § 23.106 of this part. A major swap participant that is a registered futures commission merchant may not apply for a Capital Comparability Determination and must comply with the minimum capital requirements set forth in § 1.17 of this chapter.

(c)(1) Before any applicant may be registered as a swap dealer or major swap participant, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of a registered futures association of which it is a member, or applying for membership, one of the following:

(i) That the applicant complies with the applicable regulatory capital requirements in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), or (b)(2) of this section;
