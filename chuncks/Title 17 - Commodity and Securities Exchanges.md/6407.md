###### Misdirected written requests.

(2)The Commission cannot assure that a timely or satisfactory response will be given to written requests for information, access or amendment by an individual with respect to records pertaining to him that are directed to the Commission other than in a manner prescribed in §§ 200.303(a), 200.306(a), 200.308(a)(2), and 200.310 of this subpart. Any staff member who receives a written request for information, access or amendment should promptly forward the request to the Privacy Act Officer. Misdirected requests for records will be considered to have been received by the Commission only when they have been actually received by the Privacy Act Officer in cases under § 200.308(a)(2). The General Counsel will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with a misdirected request, unless it is clearly shown that the request was in fact received by the Privacy Act Officer.
