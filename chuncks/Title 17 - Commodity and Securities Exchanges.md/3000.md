##### Admission or failure to deny charges.

(7)The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that if a respondent admits or fails to deny any of the charges, a disciplinary panel may find that the violations alleged in the notice of charges for which the respondent admitted or failed to deny any of the charges have been committed. If the swap execution facility's rules so provide, then:

(i) The disciplinary panel should impose a sanction for each violation found to have been committed;

(ii) The disciplinary panel should promptly notify the respondent in writing of any sanction to be imposed pursuant to paragraph (7)(i) of this guidance and shall advise the respondent that it may request a hearing on such sanction within the period of time, which shall be stated in the notice;

(iii) The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that if a respondent fails to request a hearing within the period of time stated in the notice, the respondent will be deemed to have accepted the sanction.
