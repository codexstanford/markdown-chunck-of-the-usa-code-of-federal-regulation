#### Pro Forma Financial Information
##### § 210.11-02 Preparation requirements.
###### e.g.,

(ii) The number of shares used in the calculation of the pro forma per share amounts must be based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period adjusted to give effect to the number of shares issued or to be issued to consummate the transaction, or if applicable whose proceeds will be used to consummate the transaction as if the shares were outstanding as of the beginning of the period presented. Calculate the pro forma effect of potential common stock being issued in the transaction (a convertible security), or the proceeds of which will be used to consummate the transaction, on pro forma earnings per share in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS-IASB, as applicable, as if the potential common stock were outstanding as of the beginning of the period presented.

(10) If the transaction is structured in such a manner that significantly different results may occur, provide additional pro forma presentations which give effect to the range of possible results.

(11) The accompanying explanatory notes must disclose:

(i) Revenues, expenses, gains and losses and related tax effects which will not recur in the income of the registrant beyond 12 months after the transaction.

(ii) For Transaction Accounting Adjustments:

(A) A table showing the total consideration transferred or received including its components and how they were measured. If total consideration includes contingent consideration, describe the arrangement(s), the basis for determining the amount of payment(s) or receipt(s), and an estimate of the range of outcomes (undiscounted) or, if a range cannot be estimated, that fact and the reasons why; and

(B) The following information when the accounting is incomplete: A prominent statement to this effect; the items for which the accounting depicted is incomplete; a description of the information that the registrant requires, including, if material, the uncertainties affecting the pro forma financial information and the possible consequences of their resolution; an indication of when the accounting is expected to be finalized; and other available information that will enable a reader to understand the magnitude of any potential adjustments to the measurements depicted.

(iii) For each Autonomous Entity Adjustment, a description of the adjustment (including the material uncertainties), the material assumptions, the calculation of the adjustment, and additional qualitative information about the Autonomous Entity Adjustments, if any, necessary to give a fair and balanced presentation of the pro forma financial information.

(12) A registrant must not:

(i) Present pro forma financial information on the face of the registrant's historical financial statements or in the accompanying notes, except where such presentation is required by U.S. GAAP or IFRS-IASB, as applicable.

(ii) Present pro forma financial information, or summaries of such information, elsewhere in a filing that excludes material transactions for which pro forma effect is required to be given.

(iii) Present the pro forma amounts in paragraph (a)(7) of this section elsewhere in a filing without also presenting with equal or greater prominence the amounts specified in paragraph (a)(7) of this section to which they are required to be reconciled and a cross-reference to that reconciliation.

(iv) Give pro forma effect to the registrant's adoption of an accounting standard in pro forma financial information required by §§ 210.11-01 through 210.11-03.
