###### Instruction 1 to paragraph (d)(1)(ii):

To determine the date on which the registration fee must be paid, the first day of the 90-day period is the first calendar day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the registration fee is to be paid. If the last day of the 90-day period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the registration fee is due on the first business day thereafter.

(2) If a registrant elects to register an offering of an indeterminate amount of exchange-traded vehicle securities pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the securities sold will be considered registered, for purposes of section 6(a) of the Act, if the registration fee has been paid and a prospectus is filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) not later than the end of the 90-day period.

(3) A registration statement filed relying on the registration fee payment provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be considered filed as to the securities identified in the registration statement for purposes of this section and section 5 of the Act when it is received by the Commission, if it complies with all other requirements under the Act, including this part.

(4) For purposes of this section, if an issuer ceases operations, the date the issuer ceases operations will be deemed to be the end of its fiscal year. In the case of a liquidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets ("merger") of the issuer, the issuer will be deemed to have ceased operations for the purposes of this section on the date the merger is consummated; provided, however, that in the case of a merger of an issuer or a series of an issuer ("Predecessor Issuer") with another issuer or a series of an issuer ("Successor Issuer"), the Predecessor Issuer will not be deemed to have ceased operations and the Successor Issuer will assume the obligations, fees, and redemption credits of the Predecessor Issuer incurred pursuant to this section if the Successor Issuer:

(i) Had no assets or liabilities, other than nominal assets or liabilities, and no operating history immediately prior to the merger;

(ii) Acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities and obligations of the Predecessor Issuer; and

(iii) The merger is not designed to result in the Predecessor Issuer merging with, or substantially all of its assets being acquired by, an issuer (or a series of an issuer) that would not meet the conditions of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
