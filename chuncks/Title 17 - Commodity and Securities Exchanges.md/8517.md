### PART 229 - STANDARD INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING FORMS UNDER SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND ENERGY POLICY AND CONSERVATION ACT OF 1975 - REGULATION S-K
#### Subpart 229.1300 - Disclosure by Registrants Engaged in Mining Operations
##### ยง 229.1302 (Item 1302) Qualified person, technical report summary, and technical studies.
###### e.g.,

(iv) Environmental compliance and permitting (what are the required permits and corresponding agencies and whether significant obstacles exist to obtaining those permits); and

(v) Any other reasonably assumed technical and economic factors, including plans, negotiations, or agreements with local individuals or groups, which are necessary to demonstrate reasonable prospects for economic extraction.

(4)(i) A qualified person may include cash flow analysis in an initial assessment to demonstrate economic potential. If the qualified person includes cash flow analysis in the initial assessment, then operating and capital cost estimates must have an accuracy level of at least approximately +/-50% and a contingency level of no greater than 25%, as provided by Table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section. The qualified person must state the accuracy and contingency levels in the initial assessment.

(ii) If providing an economic analysis in the initial assessment, a qualified person may include inferred mineral resources in the economic analysis, provided that the qualified person:

(A) States with equal prominence to the disclosure of mineral resource estimates that the assessment is preliminary in nature, it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have modifying factors applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that this economic assessment will be realized;

(B) Discloses the percentage of the mineral resources used in the cash flow analysis that was classified as inferred mineral resources; and

(C) Discloses, with equal prominence, the results of the economic analysis excluding inferred mineral resources in addition to the results that include inferred mineral resources.

(e)(1) A registrant's disclosure of mineral reserves under this subpart must be based upon a qualified person's preliminary feasibility (pre-feasibility) study or feasibility study, each as defined in ยง 229.1300, which includes and supports the qualified person's determination of mineral reserves. The pre-feasibility or feasibility study must include the qualified person's detailed evaluation of all applicable modifying factors to demonstrate the economic viability of the mining property or project. For a material property, the technical report summary submitted by the qualified person to support a determination of mineral reserves must describe the procedures, findings and conclusions reached for the pre-feasibility or feasibility study, as required by ยง 229.601(b)(96).

(2) When determining mineral reserves, a qualified person must subdivide mineral reserves, in order of increasing confidence, into probable mineral reserves and proven mineral reserves, as defined in ยง 229.1300. The determination of probable or proven mineral reserves must be based on a qualified person's application of the modifying factors to indicated or measured mineral resources, which results in the qualified person's determination that part of the indicated or measured mineral resource is economically mineable.

(i) For a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person's confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality is lower than what is sufficient for a classification as a proven mineral reserve, but is still sufficient to demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The lower level of confidence is due to higher geologic uncertainty when the qualified person converts an indicated mineral resource to a probable reserve or higher risk in the results of the application of modifying factors at the time when the qualified person converts a measured mineral resource to a probable mineral reserve. A qualified person must classify a measured mineral resource as a probable mineral reserve when his or her confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors to the measured mineral resource is lower than what is sufficient for a proven mineral reserve.

(ii) For a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person must have a high degree of confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality.

(3) The pre-feasibility study or feasibility study, which supports the qualified person's determination of mineral reserves, must demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The study must establish a life of mine plan that is technically achievable and economically viable, which will be the basis of determining the mineral reserve.
