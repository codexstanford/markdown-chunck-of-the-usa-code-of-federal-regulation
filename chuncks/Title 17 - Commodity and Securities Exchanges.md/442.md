###### contractual commitments

(8) The termshall include underwriting, when issued, when distributed, and delayed delivery contracts; and the writing or endorsement of security puts and calls and combinations thereof; but shall not include uncleared regular way purchases and sales of securities. A series of contracts of purchase or sale of the same security, conditioned, if at all, only upon issuance, may be treated as an individual commitment.

(d) Each applicant or registrant shall have equity capital (inclusive of satisfactory subordination agreements which qualify under this paragraph (d) as equity capital) of not less than 30 percent of the debt-equity total, provided, an applicant or registrant may be exempted from the provisions of this paragraph (d) for a period not to exceed 90 days or for such longer period which the Commission may, upon application of the applicant or registrant, grant in the public interest or for the protection of investors. For the purposes of this paragraph (d):

(1) Equity capital means a satisfactory subordination agreement entered into by a partner or stockholder or limited liability company member which has an initial term of at least 3 years and has a remaining term of not less than 12 months if:

(i) It does not have any of the provisions for accelerated maturity provided for by paragraphs (h)(2)(ix)(A), (x)(A), or (x)(B) of this section, or the provisions allowing for special prepayment provided for by paragraph (h)(2)(vii)(B) of this section, and is maintained as capital subject to the provisions restricting the withdrawal thereof required by paragraph (e) of this section; or

(ii) The partnership agreement provides that capital contributed pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement as defined in paragraph (h) of this section shall in all respects be partnership capital subject to the provisions restricting the withdrawal thereof required by paragraph (e) of this section, and

(A) In the case of a corporation, the sum of its par or stated value of capital stock, paid in capital in excess of par, retained earnings, unrealized profit and loss, and other capital accounts.

(B) In the case of a partnership, the sum of its capital accounts of partners (inclusive of such partners' commodities, options and securities accounts subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section), and unrealized profit and loss.

(C) In the case of a sole proprietorship, the sum of its capital accounts of the sole proprietorship and unrealized profit and loss.

(D) In the case of a limited liability company, the sum of its capital accounts of limited liability company members, and unrealized profit and loss.

(2) Debt-equity total means equity capital as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section plus the outstanding principal amount of satisfactory subordination agreements.

(e) No equity capital of the applicant or registrant or a subsidiary's or affiliate's equity capital consolidated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, whether in the form of capital contributions by partners (including amounts in the commodities, options and securities trading accounts of partners which are treated as equity capital but excluding amounts in such trading accounts which are not equity capital and excluding balances in limited partners' capital accounts in excess of their stated capital contributions), par or stated value of capital stock, paid-in capital in excess of par or stated value, retained earnings or other capital accounts, may be withdrawn by action of a stockholder or partner or limited liability company member or by redemption or repurchase of shares of stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the payment of dividends or any similar distribution, nor may any unsecured advance or loan be made to a stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, limited liability company member, or employee if, after giving effect thereto and to any other such withdrawals, advances, or loans and any payments of payment obligations (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section) under satisfactory subordination agreements and any payments of liabilities excluded pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section which are scheduled to occur within six months following such withdrawal, advance or loan:

(1) Either adjusted net capital of any of the consolidated entities would be less than the greatest of:

(i) 120 percent of the appropriate minimum dollar amount required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section;

(ii) For a futures commission merchant or applicant therefor, 120 percent of the amount required by paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section;

(iii) 120 percent of the amount of adjusted net capital required by a registered futures association of which it is a member; or

(iv) For an applicant or registrant which is also a securities broker or dealer, the amount of net capital specified in Rule 15c3-1(e) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(e)); or

(2) In the case of any applicant or registrant included within such consolidation, if equity capital of the applicant or registrant (inclusive of satisfactory subordination agreements which qualify as equity under paragraph (d) of this section) would be less than 30 percent of the required debt-equity total as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.

(f)(1) Every applicant or registrant, in computing its net capital pursuant to this section must, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(4) of this section, consolidate in a single computation, assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which it guarantees, endorses, or assumes directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities. The assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or affiliate whose liabilities and obligations have not been guaranteed, endorsed, or assumed directly or indirectly by the applicant or registrant may also be so consolidated if an opinion of counsel is obtained as provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(2)(i) If the consolidation, provided for in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, of any such subsidiary or affiliate results in the increase of the applicant's or registrant's adjusted net capital or decreases the minimum adjusted net capital requirement, and an opinion of counsel called for in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section has not been obtained, such benefits shall not be recognized in the applicant's or registrant's computation required by this section.

(ii) Except as provided for in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, consolidation shall be permitted with respect to any subsidiaries or affiliates which are majority owned and controlled by the applicant or registrant, and for which the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the National Futures Association, or for which the registrant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission and the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, by an opinion of counsel, that the net asset values or the portion thereof related to the parent's ownership interest in the subsidiary or affiliate, may be caused by the applicant or registrant or an appointed trustee to be distributed to the applicant or registrant within 30 calendar days. Such opinion must also set forth the actions necessary to cause such a distribution to be made, identify the parties having the authority to take such actions, identify and describe the rights of other parties or classes of parties, including but not limited to customers, general creditors, subordinated lenders, minority shareholders, employees, litigants, and governmental or regulatory authorities, who may delay or prevent such a distribution and such other assurances as the National Futures Association, the Commission or the designated self-regulatory organization by rule or interpretation may require. Such opinion must be current and periodically renewed in connection with the applicant's or registrant's annual audit pursuant to ยง 1.10 or upon any material change in circumstances.

(3) In preparing a consolidated computation of adjusted net capital pursuant to this section, the following minimum and non-exclusive requirements shall be observed;

(i) Consolidated adjusted net capital shall be reduced by the estimated amount of any tax reasonably anticipated to be incurred upon distribution of the assets of the subsidiary or affiliate.

(ii) Liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate which are subordinated to the claims of present and future creditors pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement shall be deducted from consolidated adjusted net capital unless such subordination extends also to the claims of present or future creditors of the parent applicant or registrant and all consolidated subsidiaries.

(iii) Subordinated liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate which are consolidated in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section may not be prepaid, repaid, or accelerated if any of the entities included in such consolidation would otherwise be unable to comply with the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section.

(iv) Each applicant or registrant included within the consolidation shall at all times be in compliance with the adjusted net capital requirement to which it is subject.

(4) No applicant or registrant shall guarantee, endorse, or assume directly or indirectly any obligation or liability of a subsidiary or affiliate unless the obligation or liability is reflected in the computation of adjusted net capital pursuant to this section except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.

(g)(1) The Commission may by order restrict, for a period of up to twenty business days, any withdrawal by a futures commission merchant of equity capital, or any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder, partner, limited liability company member, sole proprietor, employee or affiliate if the Commission, based on the facts and information available, concludes that any such withdrawal, advance or loan may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the futures commission merchant, or may unduly jeopardize its ability to meet customer obligations or other liabilities that may cause a significant impact on the markets.

(2) The futures commission merchant may file with the Secretary of the Commission a written petition to request rescission of the order issued under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The petition filed by the futures commission merchant must specify the facts and circumstances supporting its request for rescission. The Commission shall respond in writing to deny the futures commission merchant's petition for rescission, or, if the Commission determines that the order issued under paragraph (g)(1) of this section should not remain in effect, the order shall be rescinded.
