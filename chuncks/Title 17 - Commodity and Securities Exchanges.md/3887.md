##### § 41.44 General provisions.
###### Separation and consolidation of accounts.

(b)(1) The requirements for security futures and related positions in one account may not be met by considering items in any other account, except as permitted or required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or applicable margin rules. If withdrawals of cash, securities or other assets deposited as margin are permitted under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), bookkeeping entries shall be made when such cash, securities, or assets are used for purposes of meeting requirements in another account.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the security futures intermediary shall consider all futures accounts in which security futures and related positions are held that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer to be a single account for purposes of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49). The security futures intermediary may combine such accounts with other futures accounts that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer for purposes of computing a customer's overall margin requirement, as permitted or required by applicable margin rules.
