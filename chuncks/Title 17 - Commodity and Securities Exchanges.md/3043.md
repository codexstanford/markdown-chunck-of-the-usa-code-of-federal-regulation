#### Appendix B to Part 37 - Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in, Compliance with Core Principles
##### Acceptable Practices,Reasonable calculation of projected operating costs.

(b)-(1)In connection with a swap execution facility calculating its projected operating costs, the Commission has determined that a reasonable calculation should include all expenses necessary for the swap execution facility to comply with the core principles set forth in section 5h of the Act and any applicable Commission regulations. This calculation should be based on the swap execution facility's current level of business and business model, and should take into account any projected modification to its business model (e.g., the addition or subtraction of business lines or operations or other changes), and any projected increase or decrease in its level of business over the next 12 months. The Commission believes, however, that it may be reasonable for a swap execution facility to exclude the following expenses ("excludable expenses") from its projected operating cost calculations:

(i) Costs attributable solely to sales, marketing, business development, product development, or recruitment and any related travel, entertainment, event, or conference costs;

(ii) Compensation and related taxes and benefits for swap execution facility personnel who are not necessary to ensure that the swap execution facility is able to comply with the core principles set forth in section 5h of the Act and any applicable Commission regulations;

(iii) Costs for acquiring and defending patents and trademarks for swap execution facility products and related intellectual property;

(iv) Magazine, newspaper, and online periodical subscription fees;

(v) Tax preparation and audit fees;

(vi) To the extent not covered by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this Core Principle 13 of Section 5h of the Act-Financial Resources, the variable commissions that a voice-based swap execution facility may pay to its SEF trading specialists (as defined under ยง 37.201(c)), calculated as a percentage of transaction revenue generated by the voice-based swap execution facility. Unlike fixed salaries or compensation, such variable commissions are not payable unless and until revenue is collected by the swap execution facility; and

(vii) Any non-cash costs, including depreciation and amortization.
