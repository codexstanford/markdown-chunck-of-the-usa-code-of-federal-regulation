### PART 240 - GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
#### Capital, Margin and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
##### ยง 240.18a-3 Non-cleared security-based swap margin requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants for which there is not a prudential regulator.
###### Threshold amount.,1

(H)() A security-based swap dealer may elect not to collect the initial margin amount required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section to the extent that the sum of that amount plus all other credit exposures resulting from non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps of the security-based swap dealer and its affiliates with the counterparty and its affiliates does not exceed $50 million. For purposes of this calculation, a security-based swap dealer need not include any exposures arising from non-cleared security based swap transactions with a counterparty that is a commercial end user, and non-cleared swap transactions with a counterparty that qualifies for an exception from margin requirements pursuant to section 4s(e)(4) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6s(e)(4)).
