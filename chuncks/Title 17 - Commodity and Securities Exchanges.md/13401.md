###### General policies and procedures.

(a)With respect to the receipt, reporting, and dissemination of data pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909, a registered security-based swap data repository shall establish and maintain written policies and procedures:

(1) That enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap that must be reported, which shall include, at a minimum, the data elements specified in § 242.901(c) and (d);

(2) That specify one or more acceptable data formats (each of which must be an open-source structured data format that is widely used by participants), connectivity requirements, and other protocols for submitting information;

(3) For specifying procedures for reporting life cycle events and corrections to previously submitted information, making corresponding updates or corrections to transaction records, and applying an appropriate flag to the transaction report to indicate that the report is an error correction required to be disseminated by § 242.905(b)(2), or is a life cycle event, or any adjustment due to a life cycle event, required to be disseminated by § 242.902(a);

(4) For:

(i) Identifying characteristic(s) of a security-based swap, or circumstances associated with the execution or reporting of the security-based swap, that could, in the fair and reasonable estimation of the registered security-based swap data repository, cause a person without knowledge of these characteristic(s) or circumstance(s), to receive a distorted view of the market;

(ii) Establishing flags to denote such characteristic(s) or circumstance(s);

(iii) Directing participants that report security-based swaps to apply such flags, as appropriate, in their reports to the registered security-based swap data repository; and

(iv) Applying such flags:

(A) To disseminated reports to help to prevent a distorted view of the market; or

(B) In the case of a transaction referenced in § 242.902(c), to suppress the report from public dissemination entirely, as appropriate;

(5) For assigning UICs in a manner consistent with § 242.903; and
