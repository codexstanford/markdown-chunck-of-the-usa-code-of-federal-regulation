##### ยง 162.4 Scope and duration of opt out.
###### Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships.

(5)A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph b of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.
