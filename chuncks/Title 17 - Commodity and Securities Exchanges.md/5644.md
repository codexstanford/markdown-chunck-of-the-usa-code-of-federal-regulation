### PART 165 - WHISTLEBLOWER RULES
#### ยง 165.7 Procedures for award applications in Commission actions and related actions, and Commission award determinations.
##### i.e.,

(a) Whenever a Commission judicial or administrative action results in monetary sanctions totaling more than $1,000,000 (a covered judicial or administrative action) the Commission will publish on the Commission's Web site a "Notice of Covered Action." Such Notice of Covered Action will be published subsequent to the entry of a final judgment or order that alone, or collectively with other judgments or orders previously entered in the Commission covered administrative or judicial action, exceeds $1,000,000 in monetary sanctions. The Commission will not contact whistleblower claimants directly as to Notices of Covered Actions; prospective claimants should monitor the Commission Web site for such Notices. A whistleblower claimant will have 90 days from the date of the Notice of Covered Action to file a claim for an award based on that action, or the claim will be barred.
