### PART 45 - SWAP DATA RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
#### ยง 45.10 Reporting to a single swap data repository.
##### Off-facility swaps that are not clearing swaps.

(b)To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for an off-facility swap that is not a clearing swap is reported to a single swap data repository:

(1) The reporting counterparty shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the other counterparty to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.

(2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to the same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
