(ii)The Commission will, by order, declare ineffective any Form ATS-N amendment filed pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section, no later than 30 calendar days from filing with the Commission, if the Commission finds that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors. A Form ATS-N amendment declared ineffective shall prohibit the NMS Stock ATS from operating pursuant to the ineffective Form ATS-N amendment. A Form ATS-N amendment declared ineffective does not prevent the NMS Stock ATS from subsequently filing a new Form ATS-N amendment.
