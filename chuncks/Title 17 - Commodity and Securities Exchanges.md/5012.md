### PART 145 - COMMISSION RECORDS AND INFORMATION
#### ยง 145.7 Requests for Commission records and copies thereof.
##### Expedited processing.

(j)A request may be given expedited processing if the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the requested records. For purposes of this provision, the term "compelling need" means: That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity. A requester who seeks expedited processing must demonstrate a compelling need by submitting a statement that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. The Compliance Staff will determine whether to provide expedited processing, and notice of the determination will be provided to requester, within ten days after the date of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal with the Office of General Counsel within ten days of the date of the denial by the Compliance Staff. The Office of General Counsel will respond to the appeal within ten days after the date of the appeal.
