## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 150 - LIMITS ON POSITIONS
#### Appendix C to Part 150 - Guidance Regarding the Definition of Referenced Contract

This appendix C provides guidance regarding the "referenced contract" definition in ยง 150.1, which provides in paragraph (3) of the definition of referenced contract that the term referenced contract does not include a location basis contract, a commodity index contract, a swap guarantee, a trade option that meets the requirements of ยง 32.3 of this chapter, a monthly average pricing contract, or an outright price reporting agency index contract. The term "referenced contract" is used throughout part 150 of the Commission's regulations to refer to contracts that are subject to Federal position limits. A position in a contract that is not a referenced contract is not subject to Federal position limits, and, as a consequence, cannot be netted with positions in referenced contracts for purposes of Federal position limits. This guidance is intended to clarify the types of contracts that would qualify as a location basis contract, commodity index contract, monthly average pricing contract, or outright price reporting agency index contract.

Compliance with this guidance does not diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of any person to comply with the regulations provided under this part, or any other part of the Commission's regulations. The guidance is for illustrative purposes only and does not state the exclusive means for a contract to qualify, or not qualify, as a referenced contract as defined in ยง 150.1, or to comply with any other provision in this part.
