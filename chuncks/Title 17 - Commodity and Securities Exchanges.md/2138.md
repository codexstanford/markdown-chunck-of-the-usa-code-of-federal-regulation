###### Guarantee

(9)means an arrangement pursuant to which one party to a swap has rights of recourse against a guarantor, with respect to its counterparty's obligations under the swap. For these purposes, a party to a swap has rights of recourse against a guarantor if the party has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right to receive or otherwise collect, in whole or in part, payments from the guarantor with respect to its counterparty's obligations under the swap. In addition, in the case of any arrangement pursuant to which the guarantor has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right to receive or otherwise collect, in whole or in part, payments from any other guarantor with respect to the counterparty's obligations under the swap, such arrangement will be deemed a guarantee of the counterparty's obligations under the swap by the other guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until December 31, 2027, a person may continue to classify counterparties based on:

(i) Representations that were made pursuant to the "guarantee" definition in ยง 23.160(a)(2) prior to the effective date of this section; or

(ii) Representations made pursuant to the interpretation of the term "guarantee" in the Interpretive Guidance and Policy Statement Regarding Compliance With Certain Swap Regulations, 78 FR 45292 (Jul. 26, 2013), prior to the effective date of this section.
