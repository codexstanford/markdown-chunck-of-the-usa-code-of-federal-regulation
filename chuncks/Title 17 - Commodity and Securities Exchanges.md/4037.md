##### 67-percent notional amount calculation.

(1)The Commission shall use the following procedure in determining the 67-percent notional amount calculation:

(i) For each relevant swap category, select all reliable SDR data for at least a one-year period;

(ii) Convert the notional amount to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data set;

(iii) Determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the trimmed data set;

(iv) Multiply the sum of the notional amount by 67 percent;

(v) Rank order the observations by notional amount from least to greatest;

(vi) Calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 67-percent notional amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section;

(vii) Select the notional amount associated with that observation;

(viii) Round the notional amount of that observation up to two significant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that observation is already significant to only two digits, increase that notional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant digits; and

(ix) Set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(viii) of this section.
