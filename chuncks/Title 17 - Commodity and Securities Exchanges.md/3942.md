## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 43 - REAL-TIME PUBLIC REPORTING
#### ยง 43.2 Definitions.
##### Publicly reportable swap transaction

means:

(1) Unless otherwise provided in this part-

(i) Any executed swap that is an arm's-length transaction between two parties that results in a corresponding change in the market risk position between the two parties; or

(ii) Any termination, assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, amendment, conveyance, or extinguishing of rights or obligations of a swap that changes the pricing of the swap.

(2) Examples of executed swaps that do not fall within the definition of publicly reportable swap may include:

(i) Internal swaps between one-hundred percent owned subsidiaries of the same parent entity;

(ii) Portfolio compression exercises; and

(iii) Swaps entered into by a derivatives clearing organization as part of managing the default of a clearing member.

(3) These examples represent swaps that are not at arm's length and thus are not publicly reportable swap transactions, notwithstanding that they do result in a corresponding change in the market risk position between two parties.
