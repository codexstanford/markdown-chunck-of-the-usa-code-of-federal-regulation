## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 9 - RULES RELATING TO REVIEW OF EXCHANGE DISCIPLINARY, ACCESS DENIAL OR OTHER ADVERSE ACTIONS
#### Subpart D - Commission Review of Disciplinary, Access Denial or Other Adverse Action
##### ยง 9.33 Final decision by the Commission.
###### Order of summary affirmance.

(b)If the Commission finds that the result reached in the decision of the exchange is substantially correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appellant raise important questions of law or policy, the Commission may, by appropriate order, summarily affirm the decision of the exchange without opinion, which will constitute the Commission's final decision. Unless the Commission expressly indicates otherwise in its order, an order of summary affirmance does not reflect a Commission determination to adopt the exchange final decision, including any rationale contained therein, as its opinion and order, and neither the exchange's final decision nor the Commission's order of summary affirmance will serve as a Commission precedent in other proceedings.
