##### ยง 171.43 Petition for a stay of the effective date of a final decision of the National Futures Association in a member responsibility action.
###### Expedited consideration.

(e)If the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed by the National Futures Association in a member responsibility action is effective at the time a petition for a stay is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall not delay its decision on the petition to await the receipt of the National Futures Association's response. If the decision is not effective at the time the petition is filed, the Commission will not act upon the petition prior to the receipt of a response from the National Futures Association unless, in its view, expedited action on the petition is necessary to protect petitioner's right to a meaningful determination of the right to a stay. If the Commission grants the petition prior to the receipt of the response of the National Futures Association, the association may seek reconsideration of the Commission's action within seven days of service of the decision.
