(4)(i) A swap dealer or major swap participant that is subject to the supervision of a foreign jurisdiction that has received a Capital Comparability Determination from the Commission must file a notice of its intent to comply with the capital adequacy and financial reporting requirements of the foreign jurisdiction with the Commission.

(ii) Any swap dealer or major swap participant that has filed the notice set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and has received confirmation from the Commission that it may comply with a foreign jurisdiction's capital adequacy and financial reporting requirements will be deemed to be in compliance with the Commission's corresponding capital adequacy and financial reporting requirements. Accordingly, if a swap dealer or major swap participant has failed to comply with the foreign jurisdiction's capital adequacy and financial reporting requirements, the Commission may initiate an action for a violation of the Commission's corresponding requirements. All swap dealers and major swap participants, regardless of whether they rely on a Capital Comparability Determination, remain subject to the Commission's examination and enforcement authority.
