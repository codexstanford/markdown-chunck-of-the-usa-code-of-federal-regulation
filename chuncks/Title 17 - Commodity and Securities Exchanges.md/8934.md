## Chapter II - Securities and Exchange Commission
### PART 230 - GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
#### Regulation D - Rules Governing the Limited Offer and Sale of Securities Without Registration Under the Securities Act of 1933
##### § 230.504 Exemption for limited offerings and sales of securities not exceeding $10,000,000.
###### Instruction to paragraph (b)(2):

If a transaction under § 230.504 fails to meet the limitation on the aggregate offering price, it does not affect the availability of this § 230.504 for the other transactions considered in applying such limitation. For example, if an issuer sold $10,000,000 of its securities on June 1, 2021, under this § 230.504 and an additional $500,000 of its securities on December 1, 2021, this § 230.504 would not be available for the later sale, but would still be applicable to the June 1, 2021, sale.
