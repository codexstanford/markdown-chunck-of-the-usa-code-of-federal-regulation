###### Requests for records about oneself or another individual.

(2)(i) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provisions set forth in subpart H of this part to obtain any documents that would not be available to the public under the FOIA.

(ii) For requests for records about another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by the individual permitting disclosure of his or her records or proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). The Office of FOIA Services can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
