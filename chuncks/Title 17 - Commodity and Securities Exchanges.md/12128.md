(3)A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must file a notice that must be received by the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which its principal place of business is located not more than 15 business days after:

(i) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has notified the independent public accountant that provided the reports the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant filed under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section for the most recent fiscal year that the independent public accountant's services will not be used in future engagements; or

(ii) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has notified an independent public accountant that was engaged to provide the reports required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section that the engagement has been terminated; or

(iii) An independent public accountant has notified the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that the independent public accountant would not continue under an engagement to provide the reports required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section; or

(iv) A new independent public accountant has been engaged to provide the reports required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section without any notice of termination having been given to or by the previously engaged independent public accountant.

(v) The notice must include:

(A) The date of notification of the termination of the engagement or of the engagement of the new independent public accountant, as applicable; and

(B) The details of any issues arising during the 24 months (or the period of the engagement, if less than 24 months) preceding the termination or new engagement relating to any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or procedure, or compliance with applicable rules of the Commission, which issues, if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former independent public accountant, would have caused the independent public accountant to make reference to them in the report of the independent public accountant. The issues required to be reported include both those resolved to the former independent public accountant's satisfaction and those not resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction. Issues contemplated by this section are those which occur at the decision-making level-that is, between principal financial officers of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant and personnel of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its report. The notice must also state whether the accountant's report filed under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section for any of the past two fiscal years contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or was qualified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting principles, and must describe the nature of each such adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or qualification. The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must also request the former independent public accountant to furnish the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether the independent public accountant agrees with the statements contained in the notice of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant and, if not, stating the respects in which the independent public accountant does not agree. The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must file three copies of the notice and the accountant's letter, one copy of which must be manually signed by the sole proprietor, or a general partner or a duly authorized corporate, limited liability company, or limited liability partnership officer or member, as appropriate, and by the independent public accountant, respectively.
