###### Leave to intervene-when granted.

(c)No person shall be admitted as a party to a proceeding by intervention unless the Administrative Law Judge is satisfied that (1) a substantial interest of the person seeking to intervene may be adversely affected by the matter to be considered in the proceeding; (2) that his intervention will not materially prejudice the rights of any party, through delay or otherwise; (3) that his participation as a party will otherwise be consistent with the public interest; and (4) that leave to be heard pursuant to ยง 10.34 would be inadequate for the protection of his interests.
