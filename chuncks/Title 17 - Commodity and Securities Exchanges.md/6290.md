###### Aggregating requests.

(6)The Office of FOIA Services may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably believes that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, together constitute a single request that would involve unusual circumstances, as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated. The Office of FOIA Services shall advise requesters, in writing, when it determines to aggregate multiple requests and comply with paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Aggregation of requests for this purpose will be conducted independent of aggregation requests for fee purposes under paragraph (g)(8) of this section.
