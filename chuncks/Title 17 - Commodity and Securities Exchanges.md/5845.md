###### Clearing organization bankruptcies: Member property and customer property other than member property.

(ii)For a clearing organization, "customer property" is divided into "member property" and "customer property other than member property." The term member property is used to identify the cash, securities, or property available to pay the net equity claims of clearing members based on their house account at the clearing organization. Thus, in the event of a proceeding under this part in which the debtor is a clearing organization, the classification of customers as public customers or non-public customers also is relevant, in that each member of the clearing organization will have separate claims against the clearing organization (by account class) with respect to:

(A) Commodity contract transactions cleared for its own account or on behalf of any of its non-public customers (which are cleared in a "house account" at the clearing organization); and

(B) Commodity contract transactions cleared on behalf of any public customers of the clearing member (which are cleared in accounts at the clearing organization that is separate and distinct from house accounts).
