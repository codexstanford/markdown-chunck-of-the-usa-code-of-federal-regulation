###### Notification of non-compliance or material weakness.

(g)If, during the course of preparing the independent public accountant's reports required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, the independent public accountant determines that:

(1) A security-based swap dealer is not in compliance with § 240.18a-1, § 240.18a-4, § 240.18a-9, or § 240.17a-13, as applicable, or the independent public accountant determines that any material weaknesses (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) exist, the independent public accountant must immediately notify the chief financial officer of the security-based swap dealer of the nature of the non-compliance or material weakness. If the notice from the accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a security-based swap dealer to provide a notification under § 240.18a-8, or if the notice concerns a material weakness, the security-based swap dealer must provide a notification in accordance with § 240.18a-8, as applicable, and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public accountant. If the independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one business day, or if the independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notification, then the independent public accountant must notify the Commission within one business day. The report from the accountant must, if the security-based swap dealer failed to file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification under § 240.18a-8 or any material weakness. If the security-based swap dealer filed a notification, the report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the security-based swap dealer with which the accountant does not agree; or

(2) A major security-based swap participant is not in compliance with § 240.18a-2, the independent public accountant must immediately notify the chief financial officer of the major security-based swap participant of the nature of the non-compliance. If the notice from the accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a major security-based swap participant to provide a notification under § 240.18a-8, the major security-based swap participant must provide a notification in accordance with § 240.18a-8 and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public accountant. If the independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one business day, or if the independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notification, then the independent public accountant must notify the Commission within one business day. The report from the accountant must, if the major security-based swap participant failed to file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification under § 240.18a-8. If the major security-based swap participant filed a notification, the report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the major security-based swap participant with which the accountant does not agree.
