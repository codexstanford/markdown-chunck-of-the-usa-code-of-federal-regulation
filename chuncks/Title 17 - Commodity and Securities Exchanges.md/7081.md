means the amount that remains from an employee's federal pay after required deductions for federal, state and local income taxes; Social Security taxes, including Medicare taxes; federal retirement programs; premiums for life and health insurance benefits; and such other deductions that are required by law to be withheld. (See 5 CFR 581.105(b) through (f) for items required by law to be withheld, and therefore excluded from disposable pay for the purposes of this regulation.)
