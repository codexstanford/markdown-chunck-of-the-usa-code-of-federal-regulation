## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 37 - SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES
#### Appendix B to Part 37 - Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in, Compliance with Core Principles
##### Expenses allocated among affiliates.

(3)The Commission recognizes that a swap execution facility may share certain expenses with affiliated entities, such as parent entities or other subsidiaries of the parent. For example, a swap execution facility may share employees (including employees on secondment from an affiliate) that perform similar tasks for the affiliated entities or may share office space with its affiliated entities. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it would be reasonable, for purposes of calculating its projected operating costs, for a swap execution facility to prorate any shared expense that the swap execution facility pays for, but only to the extent that such shared expense is actually attributable to the affiliate and for which the swap execution facility is reimbursed. Similarly, a reasonable calculation of a swap execution facility's projected operating costs must include the prorated amount of any expense paid for by an affiliated entity to the extent that the shared expense is attributable to the swap execution facility. In order to prorate a shared expense, the swap execution facility should:

(i) Maintain sufficient documentation that reasonably shows the extent to which the shared expense is attributable to and paid for by the swap execution facility and/or affiliated entity;

(ii) Identify any shared expense in the financial reports that it submits to the Commission; and

(iii) Sufficiently explain why it prorated any shared expense. A swap execution facility may provide documentation, such as copies of service agreements, other legal documents, firm policies, audit statements, or allocation methodologies, that reasonably shows how expenses are attributable to, and paid for by, the swap execution facility and/or its affiliated entities to support its determination to prorate an expense.
