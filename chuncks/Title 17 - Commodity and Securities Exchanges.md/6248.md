###### Commission affirmation of duty officer action.

(c)(1) Any action authorized by a duty officer pursuant to § 200.43(a) shall be either (i) circulated to the members of the Commission for affirmation pursuant to § 200.42; or (ii) scheduled for affirmation at a Commission meeting at the earliest practicable date consistent with the procedures in subpart I.

(2)(i) The Commission may, in its discretion, at any time review any unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer, either upon its own initiative or upon the petition of any person affected thereby. The vote of any one member of the Commission, including the duty officer, shall be sufficient to bring any such unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer before the Commission for review.

(ii) A person or party adversely affected by any unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer shall be entitled to seek review by the Commission of the duty officer's unaffirmed actions, but only in the event that the unaffirmed action by the duty officer (A) denies any request for action pursuant to sections 8(a) or 8(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, or the first sentence of section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (B) suspends trading in a security pursuant to section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (C) is pursuant to any provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in a case of adjudication, as defined in section 551 of Title 5, U.S. Code, not required by that Act to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in section 554(a) (1) through (6) of Title 5, United States Code).

(3) Affirmed or unaffirmed action taken by the duty officer shall be deemed to be, for all purposes, the action of the Commission unless and until the Commission directs otherwise. Rules 430 and 431 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, §§ 201.430 and 201.431 of this chapter, shall not apply to duty officer action.
