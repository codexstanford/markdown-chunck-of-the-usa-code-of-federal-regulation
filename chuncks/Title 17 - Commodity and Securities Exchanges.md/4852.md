After the Commission has formally reached a decision or taken other action on a matter, has agreed upon the language of the document which embodies the Commission decision or other action, including, but not limited to, a rule, regulation or order, and has directed that the document be issued, the Secretary of the Commission (or a person designated in writing by the Secretary) shall sign the document on behalf of the Commission.
