### PART 75 - PROPRIETARY TRADING AND CERTAIN INTERESTS IN AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH COVERED FUNDS
#### Appendix A to Part 75 - Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities
##### Description:

i.For purposes of this appendix, Transaction Volumes measures three exclusive categories of covered trading activity conducted by a trading desk. A banking entity is required to report the value and number of security and derivative transactions conducted by the trading desk with: (i) Customers, excluding internal transactions; (ii) non-customers, excluding internal transactions; and (iii) trading desks and other organizational units where the transaction is booked into either the same banking entity or an affiliated banking entity. For securities, value means gross market value. For derivatives, value means gross notional value. For purposes of calculating the Transaction Volumes quantitative measurement, do not include in the Transaction Volumes calculation for "securities" those securities that are also "derivatives," as those terms are defined under subpart A; instead, report those securities that are also derivatives as "derivatives."Further, for purposes of the Transaction Volumes quantitative measurement, a customer of a trading desk that relies on ยง 75.4(a) to conduct underwriting activity is a market participant identified in ยง 75.4(a)(7), and a customer of a trading desk that relies on ยง 75.4(b) to conduct market making-related activity is a market participant identified in ยง 75.4(b)(3).
