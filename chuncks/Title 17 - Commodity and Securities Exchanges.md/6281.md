###### Consultation.

(i)In instances where a record is requested that originated within a division or office within the Commission and another Federal agency has a significant interest in the record (or a portion thereof), the Office of FOIA Services will consult with that Federal agency before responding to a requester. When the Office of FOIA Services receives a request for a record (or a portion thereof) in its possession that originated with another entity within the Federal Government that is not subject to the FOIA, the Office of FOIA Services will typically consult with that entity prior to making a release determination.
