##### § 229.1302 (Item 1302) Qualified person, technical report summary, and technical studies.
###### affiliate,affiliated

(5) The registrant must state in the filed registration statement or report whether each qualified person who prepared the technical report summary is an employee of the registrant. If the qualified person is not an employee of the registrant, the registrant must name the qualified person's employer, disclose whether the qualified person or the qualified person's employer is affiliated with the registrant or another entity that has an ownership, royalty, or other interest in the property that is the subject of the technical report summary, and if affiliated, describe the nature of the affiliation. As used in this section,orhas the same meaning as in § 230.405 or § 240.12b-2 of this chapter.

(6)(i) A qualified person may include in the technical report summary information and documentation provided by a third-party specialist who is not a qualified person, as defined in § 229.1300, such as an attorney, appraiser, and economic or environmental consultant, upon which the qualified person has relied in preparing the technical report summary.

(ii) The qualified person may not disclaim responsibility for any information or documentation prepared by a third-party specialist upon which the qualified person has relied, or any part of the technical report summary based upon or related to that information and documentation.

(iii) A registrant is not required to file a written consent of any third-party specialist upon which a qualified person has relied pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.

(c)(1) A registrant may disclose an exploration target, as defined in § 229.1300, for one or more of its properties that is based upon and accurately reflects information and supporting documentation of a qualified person. The qualified person may include a discussion of an exploration target in a technical report summary.

(2) Any disclosure of an exploration target must appear in a separate section of the Commission filing or technical report summary that is clearly captioned as a discussion of an exploration target. That section must include a clear and prominent statement that:

(i) The ranges of potential tonnage and grade (or quality) of the exploration target are conceptual in nature;

(ii) There has been insufficient exploration of the relevant property or properties to estimate a mineral resource;

(iii) It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a mineral resource; and

(iv) The exploration target therefore does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve.

(3) Any disclosure of an exploration target must also include:

(i) A detailed explanation of the basis for the exploration target, such as the conceptual geological model used to develop the target;

(ii) An explanation of the process used to determine the ranges of tonnage and grade, which must be expressed as approximations;

(iii) A statement clarifying whether the exploration target is based on actual exploration results or on one or more proposed exploration programs, which should include a description of the level of exploration activity already completed, the proposed exploration activities designed to test the validity of the exploration target, and the time frame in which those activities are expected to be completed; and

(iv) A statement that the ranges of tonnage and grade (or quality) of the exploration target could change as the proposed exploration activities are completed.

(d)(1) A registrant's disclosure of mineral resources under this subpart must be based upon a qualified person's initial assessment, as defined in § 229.1300, which includes and supports the qualified person's determination of mineral resources.

(i) When determining the existence of a mineral resource, a qualified person must:

(A) Be able to estimate or interpret the location, quantity, grade or quality continuity, and other geological characteristics of the mineral resource from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling; and

(B) Conclude that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction of the mineral resource based on his or her initial assessment. At a minimum, the initial assessment must include the qualified person's qualitative evaluation of relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction to establish the economic potential of the mining property or project.

(ii) For a material property, the technical report summary submitted by the qualified person to support a determination of mineral resources must describe the procedures, findings and conclusions reached for the initial assessment, as required by § 229.601(b)(96).

(iii)(A) When determining mineral resources, a qualified person must subdivide mineral resources, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated, and measured mineral resources.

(B) For inferred mineral resources, a qualified person:
