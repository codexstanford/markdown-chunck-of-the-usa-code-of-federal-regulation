(5) Upon a determination by the Administrative Law Judge, certified to the Commission either in writing or on the record, that

(i) A ruling sought to be appealed involves a controlling question of law or policy;

(ii) An immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate resolution of the issues in the proceeding; and

(iii) Subsequent reversal of the ruling would cause unnecessary delay or expense to the parties.
