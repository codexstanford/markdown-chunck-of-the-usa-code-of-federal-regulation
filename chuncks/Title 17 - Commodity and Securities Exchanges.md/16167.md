(ii) May not consolidate in a single computation of liquid capital the assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which the parent broker or dealer guarantees, endorses, or assumes directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities if the parent broker or dealer has not obtained the opinion of counsel described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to such subsidiary or affiliate, but in that event, the parent broker or dealer shall compute its total haircuts by adding the total haircuts of each such subsidiary or affiliate computed in accordance with the provisions of § 402.2 to the haircuts of the parent broker or dealer computed separately in accordance with the provisions of § 402.2; and

(iii) May consolidate in its computation of liquid capital the assets and liabilities of any majority owned and controlled subsidiary or affiliate for which the parent broker or dealer does not guarantee, endorse or assume directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities if the parent broker or dealer has obtained the opinion of counsel described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to such subsidiary or affiliate.
