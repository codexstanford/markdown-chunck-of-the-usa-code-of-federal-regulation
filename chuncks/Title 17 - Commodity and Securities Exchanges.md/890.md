(a)(1) On the basis of information obtained by the Commission, the Commission may at any time serve written notice upon a registrant in any capacity under the Act that:

(i) The Commission alleges and is prepared to prove, by reference to an information, indictment or complaint authorized by a United States Attorney or an appropriate official of any State that the registrant is charged with the commission of or participation in a crime involving a violation of the Act or a violation of any other provision of Federal or State law that would reflect on the honesty or the fitness of the person to act as a fiduciary that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and that continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission;

(ii) An Administrative Law Judge shall make a determination, based upon written evidence and any oral hearing granted, as to whether the registrant is charged with the Commission of or participation in such a crime and whether the continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission; and

(iii) If the registrant is found to be charged with the commission of or participation in such a crime and it is found that the continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission, the registration of the registrant shall be suspended or modified.

(2) The notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall include a short and plain statement that the continued registration of the registrant may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission.
