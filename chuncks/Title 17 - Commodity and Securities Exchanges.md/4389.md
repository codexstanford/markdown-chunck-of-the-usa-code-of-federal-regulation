(a)Prior to a swap data repository providing access to swap data to any appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator, each as defined in ยง 49.17(b), the swap data repository shall receive from such appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator, pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Act, an executed confidentiality arrangement between the Commission and the appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator, as applicable, in the form set forth in appendix B to this part 49 or, in the Commission's discretion as set forth in ยง 49.17(d)(6), in a different form, provided that such confidentiality arrangement contains the elements required in paragraph (b) of this section. Such confidentiality arrangement must include, either as Exhibit A to the form set forth in appendix B of this part or similarly appended, a description of the appropriate domestic regulator's or appropriate foreign regulator's jurisdiction. Once a swap data repository is notified, in writing, that a confidentiality arrangement received from an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator no longer is in effect, the swap data repository shall not provide access to swap data to such appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator.
