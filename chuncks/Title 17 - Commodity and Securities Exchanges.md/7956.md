##### ยง 229.402 (Item 402) Executive compensation.
###### i.e.,

(iii) A registrant may include non-financial performance measures (performance measures other than those that fall within the definition of financial performance measures) used by the registrant to link compensation actually paid to the registrant's named executive officers, for the most recently completed fiscal year, to company performance in the Tabular List, if it determines that such measures are among its three to seven most important performance measures, and it has disclosed its most important three (or fewer, if the registrant only uses fewer) financial performance measures, in accordance with this paragraph (v)(6).

(iv) The Tabular List may include a maximum of seven performance measures, regardless of whether the registrant elects to include non-financial performance measures in the Tabular List.

(7) The disclosure provided pursuant to this paragraph (v), including, but not limited to, any disclosure provided pursuant to paragraphs (v)(3) and (6) of this section, must appear with, and in the same format as, the rest of the disclosure required to be provided pursuant to this section and, in addition, must be provided in an Interactive Data File in accordance with ยง 232.405 of this chapter and the EDGAR Filer Manual (referenced in ยง 232.301 of this chapter).

(8) A registrant that qualifies as a "smaller reporting company," as defined by ยง 229.10(f)(1) of this chapter, may provide the information required by this paragraph (v) for three years, instead of five years. A smaller reporting company may provide the disclosure required by this paragraph (v) for only two fiscal years in the first filing in which it provides this disclosure, and is not required to provide the disclosure required by paragraph (v)(2)(iv) or (v)(5) of this section with respect to the total shareholder return of any peer group, or the Company-Selected Measure disclosure required by paragraph (v)(2)(vi) of this section, or the Tabular List provided pursuant to paragraph (v)(6) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (v)(2)(iii) of this section with respect to smaller reporting companies, executive compensation actually paid must be the total compensation for the covered fiscal year for each named executive officer as provided in paragraph (n)(2)(x) of this section, adjusted to deduct the amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table pursuant to paragraphs (n)(2)(v) and (vi) of this section, and to add in their place the fair value of the amounts added in paragraph (v)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. Disclose in a footnote to the table required pursuant to paragraph (v)(1) of this section for the PEO and average remaining named executive officer compensation the amounts deducted from, and added to, the Summary Compensation Table pursuant to this instruction, the name of each named executive officer included as a PEO or in the calculation of the average remaining named executive officer compensation, and the fiscal years in which they are included. A smaller reporting company is required to comply with paragraph (v)(7) of this section in the third filing in which it provides the disclosure required by this paragraph (v).
