(ii) The next available opening price of the underlying security or securities.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, if a derivatives clearing organization registered under section 5b of the Act or a clearing agency exempt from registration pursuant to section 5b(a)(2) of the Act, to which the final settlement price of a security futures product is or would be reported determines, pursuant to its rules, that such final settlement price is not consistent with the protection of customers and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to buyers and sellers of the affected security futures product, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in such security futures product, and consistency of interpretation and practice, the clearing organization shall have the authority to determine, under its rules, a final settlement price for such security futures product.
