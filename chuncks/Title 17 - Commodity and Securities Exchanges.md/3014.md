#### Appendix B to Part 37 - Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in, Compliance with Core Principles
##### Cash-settled swaps.

(3)For cash-settled swaps, the swap execution facility should monitor for pricing abnormalities in the index or instrument used to calculate the reference price. If the swap execution facility computes its own reference price used for cash flows or settlement, it should promptly amend any methodologies that result, or are likely to result, in manipulation, price distortions, or market disruptions, or impose new methodologies to resolve the threat of disruptions or distortions. If the swap execution facility relies upon a third-party index or instrument, including an index or instrument traded on another venue for the swap reference price, it should conduct due diligence to ensure that the reference price is not susceptible to manipulation and that the terms and conditions of the swap continue to comply with ยง 37.300.
