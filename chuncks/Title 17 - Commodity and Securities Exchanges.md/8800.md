(5) An issuer paying the fee required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section or any portion thereof more than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer shall pay to the Commission interest on unpaid amounts, calculated based on the interest rate in effect at the time of the interest payment by reference to the "current value of funds rate" on the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service internet site ator by calling (202) 874-6995, and using the following formula: I = (X) (Y) (Z/365), where: I = Amount of interest due; X = Amount of registration fee due; Y = Applicable interest rate, expressed as a fraction; Z = Number of days by which the registration fee payment is late. The payment of interest pursuant to this paragraph (d)(5) shall not preclude the Commission from bringing an action to enforce the requirements of this paragraph (d).

(6) An immaterial or unintentional failure to comply with a requirement of this paragraph (d) will not result in a violation of section 6(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77f(a)), so long as:

(i) A good faith and reasonable effort was made to comply with the requirement; and

(ii) In the case of a late payment of a registration fee, the issuer pays the registration fee and any interest due thereon as soon as practicable after discovery of the failure to pay the registration fee.
