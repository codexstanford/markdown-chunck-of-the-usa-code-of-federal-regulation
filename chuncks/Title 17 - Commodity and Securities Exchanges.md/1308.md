## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 5 - OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
#### ยง 5.23 Notice of bulk transfers and bulk liquidations.
##### Notice and disclosure to retail forex customers of a bulk transfer.

(a)(1) A retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker must obtain the written prior and specific consent of its retail forex customer to the assignment of any position or transfer of any account of the retail forex customer to another retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker, unless made at the retail forex customer's request.

(2) Absent a request of the retail forex customer or the consent described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, assignments of positions and transfers of accounts of retail forex customers may be permitted under rules of the retail forex dealer's, futures commission merchant's, or introducing broker's designated self-regulatory organization that establish notice and other requirements with respect to the assignment of positions and transfers of accounts of retail forex customers. If such rules permit implied consent as a result of the failure of the retail forex customer to object after having received notice of the proposed assignment or transfer, such rules must provide that the notice must include a statement that the retail forex customer is not required to accept the proposed assignment or transfer and may direct the transferor firm to liquidate the positions of the retail forex customer or transfer the account to a firm of the retail forex customer's selection.

(3) For assignments and transfers made under this section, other than at the retail forex customer's request, the transferee retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker must provide to the retail forex customer the risk disclosure statements and forms of acknowledgment required by part 5 of this chapter and receive the required signed acknowledgments within sixty days of such assignments or transfers. This requirement shall not apply:

(i) If the transferee retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker has clear written evidence that the retail forex customer has received and acknowledged receipt of the required disclosure statements; or

(ii) If the transfer of accounts is made from one introducing broker to another introducing broker guaranteed by the same retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant pursuant to a guarantee agreement in accordance with the requirements of ยง 1.10(j) of this chapter and such retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant maintains the relevant acknowledgments required by part 5 of this chapter.
