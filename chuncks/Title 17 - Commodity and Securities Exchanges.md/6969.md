Notice of these adjusted penalty amounts will be published by the Commission in theon or before January 15 of each calendar year and will be available, along with the Commission's prior inflation adjustments, on the Commission's Web site atThe adjusted penalty amounts will apply to all penalties imposed after the effective date of the adjustment (for the first day the adjustment is effective, the prior year's penalty amounts shall apply), for violations that occurred after November 2, 2015. The adjusted penalty amount each year will be the larger of:

(1) The maximum penalty amount for the previous calendar year; or

(2) An amount adjusted for inflation, calculated by multiplying the maximum penalty amount for the previous calendar year by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the month of October preceding the current calendar year exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year two years prior to the current calendar year, adding that amount to the amount for the previous calendar year, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.
