###### Appropriateness of restitution as a remedy.

(a)In any proceeding in which an order requiring restitution may be entered, the Administrative Law Judge shall, as part of his or her initial decision, determine whether restitution is appropriate. In deciding whether restitution is appropriate, the Administrative Law Judge, in his or her discretion, may consider the degree of complexity likely to be involved in establishing claims, the likelihood that claimants can obtain compensation through their own efforts, the ability of the respondent to pay claimants damages that his or her violations have caused, the availability of resources to administer restitution and any other matters that justice may require.
