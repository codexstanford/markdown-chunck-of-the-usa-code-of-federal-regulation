###### Standards for granting petition for stay.

(d)The Commission will promptly determine whether to grant or deny a petition for stay and may act upon a petition at any time, without waiting for a response thereto. In determining whether to grant or deny the petition for stay, the Commission will consider, among other things, whether the petitioner has established:

(1) Petitioner's likelihood of success on the merits; and

(2) That denial of the stay would cause irreparable harm to the petitioner; and

(3) That granting the stay would not endanger orderly trading or otherwise cause substantial harm to the exchange or market participants; and

(4) That granting the stay would not be contrary to the Act, and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission thereunder or otherwise contrary to the public interest.
