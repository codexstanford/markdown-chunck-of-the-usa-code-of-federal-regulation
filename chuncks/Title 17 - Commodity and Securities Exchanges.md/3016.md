##### Risk controls for trading.

(5)An acceptable program for preventing market disruptions shall demonstrate appropriate trading risk controls, in addition to pauses and halts. Risk controls should be adapted to the unique characteristics of the trading platform and of the markets to which they apply and should be designed to avoid market disruptions without unduly interfering with that market's price discovery function. The swap execution facility may choose from among controls that include: pre-trade limits on order size, price collars or bands around the current price, message throttles, daily price limits, and intraday position limits related to financial risk to the clearing member, or design other types of controls, as well as clear error-trade and order-cancellation policies. Within the specific array of controls that are selected, the swap execution facility should set the parameters for those controls, so that the specific parameters are reasonably likely to serve the purpose of preventing market disruptions and price distortions. If a swap is fungible with, linked to, or a substitute for other swaps on the swap execution facility or on other trading venues, such risk controls should, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with any similar controls placed on those other swaps. If a swap is based on the level of an equity index, such risk controls should, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with any similar controls placed on national security exchanges.
