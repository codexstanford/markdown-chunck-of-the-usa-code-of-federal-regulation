###### Cut-off grade,i.e.,

is the grade (the concentration of metal or mineral in rock) that determines the destination of the material during mining. For purposes of establishing "prospects of economic extraction," the cut-off grade is the grade that distinguishes material deemed to have no economic value (it will not be mined in underground mining or if mined in surface mining, its destination will be the waste dump) from material deemed to have economic value (its ultimate destination during mining will be a processing facility). Other terms used in similar fashion as cut-off grade include net smelter return, pay limit, and break-even stripping ratio.
