###### Application for registration.

(a)(1) Application for registration as a floor broker or floor trader must be on Form 8-R, if as an individual, or Form 7-R, if as a non-natural person, and must be completed and filed with the National Futures Association in accordance with the instructions thereto. Each Form 7-R filed in accordance with this paragraph (a) must be accompanied by a Form 8-R, completed in accordance with the instructions thereto and executed by each individual who is a principal of the applicant, and each individual responsible for entry of orders from that applicant's own account. Each Form 8-R filed in accordance with this paragraph (a) must be accompanied by the fingerprints of the applicant on a fingerprint card provided for that purpose by the National Futures Association, except that a fingerprint card need not be filed by any applicant who has a current Form 8-R on file with the Commission or the National Futures Association.

(2) An applicant for registration as a floor broker or floor trader will not be registered or issued a temporary license as a floor broker or floor trader unless the applicant has been granted trading privileges by a board of trade designated as a contract market or registered as a swap execution facility by the Commission.

(3) When the Commission or the National Futures Association determines that an applicant for registration as a floor broker or floor trader is not disqualified from such registration or temporary license, the National Futures Association will notify the applicant and any contract market or swap execution facility that has granted the applicant trading privileges that the applicant's registration or temporary license as a floor broker or floor trader is granted.
