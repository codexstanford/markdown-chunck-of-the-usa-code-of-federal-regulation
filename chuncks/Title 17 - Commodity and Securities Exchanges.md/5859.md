(i) Thus, as noted in paragraph (2) of the definition ofin ยง 190.01, where open commodity contracts (and associated collateral) that would be attributable to one account class are, instead, commingled with the commodity contracts (and associated collateral) in a second account class (the "home field"), then the trustee must treat all such commodity contracts and collateral as part of, and consistent with the regulations applicable to, the second account class.

(ii) The concept in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, that the rules of the "home field" will apply, also pertains to securities positions that are, pursuant to an approved cross margining program, held in a commodities account class (in which case the rules of that commodities account class will apply) and to commodities positions that are, pursuant to an approved cross-margining program, held in a securities account (in which case, the rules of the securities account will apply, consistent with section 16(2)(b)(ii) of SIPA, 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(b)(ii)).
