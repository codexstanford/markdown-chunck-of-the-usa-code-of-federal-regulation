###### Trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information.

(2)If any party or person against whom an order to produce has been directed acting in good faith has reason to believe that any documents or other tangible thing ordered to be produced contains a trade secret, or commercially sensitive or other confidential information, the party or person may, in lieu of serving any such document, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, file and serve a written request for confidential treatment of such documents. Any such request for confidential treatment shall be accompanied by a verified statement identifying with particularity the information on those documents considered to be trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information, with reasons therefor, and indicating which portions, if any, of those documents may be served on other parties without disclosure of such information. Upon considering a request for confidential treatment in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2), the decisionmaking official may, if upon a finding that the information identified in the request warrants confidential treatment and is not probative of any material fact in controversy, make copies of the documents produced, delete such information from the copies, and serve the copies as modified upon the other parties, with or without an appropriate protective order limiting dissemination to the parties and their counsel, if any.
