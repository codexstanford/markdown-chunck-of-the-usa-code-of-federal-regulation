## Chapter I - Commodity Futures Trading Commission
### PART 146 - RECORDS MAINTAINED ON INDIVIDUALS
#### § 146.12 Exemptions.

(a) Investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, on the basis and to the extent that individual access to these files could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the Commission's regulatory and enforcement program. Materials exempted under this paragraph are contained in the system of records entitled "Exempted Investigatory Records" and/or in the system of records entitled "Exempted Closed Commission Meetings." Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no record which has served as a basis for denying an individual a right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be eligible, shall be maintained in this system, unless the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. For records of this type, if practicable, material identifying the confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a comparable nonexempted system of records.

(b) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment with the Commission are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent that it identifies a confidential source. This is done in order to encourage persons from whom information is sought to provide information to the Commission which, absent assurances of confidentiality, they would be unwilling to give. However, if practicable, material identifying a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a non-exempt system containing the same category of record. Materials exempted under this paragraph are included in the system of records entitled "Exempted Employee Background Investigation Material" and/or in the system of records entitled "Exempted Closed Commission Meetings."

(c) The systems set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are hereby exempted from the provisions of sections 552a(c), (3)(d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I) and (f) of title 5 of the U.S. Code (the Privacy Act of 1974), and are also exempted from the following sections of these rules: § 146.3 (requests for information and for access); § 146.5 (access to records); § 146.6(d) (accounting of disclosures to be made available to the individual); § 146.11(a) (7), (8), (9) (content of the system notice); and § 146.7(a) (relevancy of records).
