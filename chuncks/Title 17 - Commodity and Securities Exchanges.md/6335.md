##### ยง 200.80 Securities and Exchange Commission records and information.
###### The primary interest in disclosure:

(B)whether the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The Office of FOIA Services ordinarily shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

(iv) If only a portion of the requested records satisfies both the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction of fees will be granted for only that portion.

(v) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should address all the factors identified in paragraphs (g)(12)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

(vi) Denials of requests for a waiver or reduction of fees are adverse determinations (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section) and may be appealed to the General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
