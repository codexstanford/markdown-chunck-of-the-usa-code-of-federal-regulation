###### SSFA parameters.

(2)To calculate the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position using the SSFA, a swap dealer must have accurate information on the five inputs to the SSFA calculation described in paragraphs (n)(2)(i) through (n)(2)(v) of this appendix.

(i) Kis the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated for a swap dealer's credit risk. Kis expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent presents a value of Kequal to 0.08).

(ii) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (n)(2)(ii)(A) through (F) of this appendix to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:

(A) Ninety days or more past due;

(B) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

(C) In the process of foreclosure;

(D) Held as real estate owned;

(E) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on;
