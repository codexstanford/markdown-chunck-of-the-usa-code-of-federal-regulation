## Chapter II - Securities and Exchange Commission
### PART 240 - GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
#### Capital, Margin and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
##### ยง 240.18a-3 Non-cleared security-based swap margin requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants for which there is not a prudential regulator.
###### Model approach.

(2)(i) For security-based swaps other than equity security-based swaps, a security-based swap dealer may apply to the Commission for authorization to use and be responsible for a model to calculate the initial margin amount required by paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section subject to the application process in ยง 240.15c3-1e or ยง 240.18a-1(d), as applicable. The model must use a 99 percent, one-tailed confidence level with price changes equivalent to a ten business-day movement in rates and prices, and must use risk factors sufficient to cover all the material price risks inherent in the positions for which the initial margin amount is being calculated, including foreign exchange or interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk, and commodity risk, as appropriate. Empirical correlations may be recognized by the model within each broad risk category, but not across broad risk categories.

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, a security-based swap dealer that is not registered as a broker or dealer pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)), other than as an OTC derivatives dealer, may apply to the Commission for authorization to use a model to calculate the initial margin amount required by paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section for equity security-based swaps, subject to the application process and model requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; provided, however, the account of the counterparty subject to the requirements of this paragraph may not hold equity security positions other than equity security-based swaps and equity swaps.
