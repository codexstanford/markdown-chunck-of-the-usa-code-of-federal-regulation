####### Counterparty notification,provided, however,

(iv)In connection with the transaction, the registered entity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section notifies the counterparties of the non-U.S. person relying on this exception that the non-U.S. person is not registered with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer, and that certain Exchange Act provisions or rules addressing the regulation of security-based swaps would not be applicable in connection with the transaction, including provisions affording clearing rights to counterparties. Such notice shall be provided contemporaneously with, and in the same manner as, the arranging, negotiating, or executing activity at issue;that during a period in which a counterparty is neither a customer (as such term is defined in ยง 240.15c3-3) of the registered entity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (if such registered entity is a registered broker or dealer) nor a counterparty to a security-based swap with the registered entity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, such notice need only be provided contemporaneously with, and in the same manner as, the first such arranging, negotiating, or executing activity during such period. This disclosure will not be required if the identity of that counterparty is not known to that registered entity at a reasonably sufficient time prior to the execution of the transaction to permit such disclosure.
