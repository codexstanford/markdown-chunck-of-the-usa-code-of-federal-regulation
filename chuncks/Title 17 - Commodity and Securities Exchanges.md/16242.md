(2)(i) Where customer securities are maintained by a depository institution at another depository institution, including but not limited to a correspondent bank or a trust company ("custodian institution"), the depository institution shall be in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if:

(A) The depository institution notifies the custodian institution that such securities are customer securities;

(B) The custodian institution maintains such securities in an account that is designated for customers of the depository institution and that does not contain proprietary securities of the depository institution; and

(C) The depository institution instructs the custodian institution to maintain such securities free of any lien, charge, or claim of any kind in favor of such custodian institution or any persons claiming through it.
