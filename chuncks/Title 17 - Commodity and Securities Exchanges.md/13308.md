(v)(A) An initial Form CC filed by a competing consolidator will become effective, unless declared ineffective, no later than the expiration of the review period provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section and publication pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

(B) The Commission shall, by order, declare an initial Form CC ineffective if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors. If the Commission declares an initial Form CC ineffective, the competing consolidator shall be prohibited from operating as a competing consolidator. An initial Form CC declared ineffective does not prevent the competing consolidator from subsequently filing a new Form CC.
