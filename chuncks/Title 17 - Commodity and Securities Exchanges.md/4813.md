### PART 75 - PROPRIETARY TRADING AND CERTAIN INTERESTS IN AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH COVERED FUNDS
#### Appendix A to Part 75 - Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities

a. This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B ("proprietary trading restrictions"). Pursuant to ยง 75.20(d), this appendix applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities. These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to the CFTC regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports. The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entity's internal compliance program under ยง 75.20.

b. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and the CFTC in:

(1) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entity's covered trading activities;

(2) Monitoring the banking entity's covered trading activities;

(3) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions;

(4) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to ยง 75.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities;
