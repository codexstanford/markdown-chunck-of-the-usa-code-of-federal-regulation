###### Clarification of request.

(3)The Office of FOIA Services may seek clarification of a request (or a portion of a request) for records. The request for clarification generally should be in writing. The first time the Office of FOIA Services seeks clarification, the time for responding to the entire request (set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) is tolled until the requester responds to the clarification request. The tolled period will end when the Office of FOIA Services receives a response from the requester that reasonably describes the requested records. If the Office of FOIA Services asks for clarification and does not receive a written response from the requester within 30 calendar days from the date of the clarification request, the Office of FOIA Services will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the record(s) sought and notify the requester that any portion of the request as to which clarification was sought has been closed.
