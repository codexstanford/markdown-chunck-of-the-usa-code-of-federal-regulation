##### Notice of charges.

(4)If compliance staff authorized by a swap execution facility or a swap execution facility disciplinary panel determines, based upon reviewing an investigation report pursuant to ยง 37.203(f)(3), that a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation and adjudication is warranted, it should direct that the person or entity alleged to have committed the violation be served with a notice of charges and should proceed in accordance with this guidance. A notice of charges should adequately state the acts, conduct, or practices in which the respondent is alleged to have engaged; state the rule, or rules, alleged to have been violated (or about to be violated); advise the respondent that it is entitled, upon request, to a hearing on the charges; and prescribe the period within which a hearing on the charges may be requested. If the rules of the swap execution facility so provide, a notice may also advise:

(i) That failure to request a hearing within the period prescribed in the notice, except for good cause, may be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing; and

(ii) That failure to answer or to deny expressly a charge may be deemed to be an admission of such charge.
