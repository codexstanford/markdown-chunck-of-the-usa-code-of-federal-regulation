###### Requirements for resetting levels of position limits.

(vi)A designated contract market shall calculate estimated deliverable supply and six-month total trading volume no less frequently than semi-annually.

(A) If the estimated deliverable supply data supports a lower speculative limit for a security futures product, then the designated contract market shall lower the position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of ยง 41.24. If the data require imposition of a reduced position limit for a security futures product, the designated contract market may permit any trader holding a position in compliance with the previous position limit, but in excess of the reduced limit, to maintain such position through the expiration of the security futures contract; provided, that the designated contract market does not find that the position poses a threat to the orderly expiration of such contract.

(B) If the estimated deliverable supply or six-month total trading volume data no longer supports a position accountability rule in lieu of a position limit for a security futures product, then the designated contract market shall establish a position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of ยง 41.24.

(C) If the estimated deliverable supply data supports a higher speculative limit for a security futures product, as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, then the designated contract market may raise the position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of ยง 41.24.
