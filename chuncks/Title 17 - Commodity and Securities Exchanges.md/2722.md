### PART 31 - LEVERAGE TRANSACTIONS
#### § 31.9 Minimum financial requirements.

(a) Each leverage transaction merchant must at all times maintain adjusted net capital equal to or in excess of $2,500,000, plus 20 percent of the market value of the amount of physical commodities subject to leverage contracts entered into by the leverage transaction merchant which are uncovered, plus 2percent of the market value of the amount of physical commodities subject to short leverage contracts entered into by the leverage transaction merchant which are covered.

(1) For purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, each leverage transaction merchant must compute the market value of the physical commodities subject to leverage contracts which it has entered into by using the widely accepted and broadly disseminated commercial or retail cash price series submitted with the leverage transaction merchant's application for registration of the leverage commodity in accordance with § 31.6, and cannot include any mark-ups or discounts of the leverage transaction merchant.

(2) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be applicable if the applicant or registrant is a member of a designated self-regulatory organization and conforms to minimum financial standards and related reporting requirements set by such designated self-regulatory organization in its bylaws, rules, regulations or resolutions approved by the Commission pursuant to section 19 of the Act and § 31.28 of this part.

(3) No person applying for registration as a leverage transaction merchant shall be so registered unless such person affirmatively demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that it complies with the financial requirements of this section. Each leverage transaction merchant must be in compliance with this section at all times and must be able to demonstrate such compliance to the satisfaction of the Commission and/or the designated self-regulatory organization.

(4) A leverage transaction merchant who is not in compliance with this section, or is unable to demonstrate such compliance as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must immediately cease engaging in the business of offering to enter into, entering into, or confirming the execution of, any leverage contract until such time as the leverage transaction merchant is able to demonstrate such compliance. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing the Commission or the designated self-regulatory organization from taking action against a leverage transaction merchant for non-compliance with any of the provisions of this section. Any leverage transaction merchant required immediately to cease doing business under this paragraph shall remain liable on all leverage contracts previously entered into until all rights of and obligations owing to the customers thereunder have been fulfilled.
