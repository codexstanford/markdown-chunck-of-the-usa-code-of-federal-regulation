####### Application of major security-based swap participant tests in the cross-border context.

(b)For purposes of calculating a person's status as a major security-based swap participant as defined in section 3(a)(67) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)), and the rules and regulations thereunder, a person shall include the following security-based swap positions:

(1) If such person is a U.S. person, all security-based swap positions that are entered into by the person, including positions entered into through a foreign branch;

(2) If such person is a conduit affiliate, all security-based swap positions that are entered into by the person; and

(3) If such person is a non-U.S. person other than a conduit affiliate, all of the following types of security-based swap positions that are entered into by the person:

(i) Security-based swap positions that are entered into with a U.S. person; provided, however, that this paragraph (b)(3)(i) shall not apply to:

(A) Positions with a U.S. person counterparty that arise from transactions conducted through a foreign branch of the counterparty, when the counterparty is a registered security-based swap dealer; and

(B) Positions with a U.S. person counterparty that arise from transactions conducted through a foreign branch of the counterparty, when the transaction is entered into prior to 60 days following the earliest date on which the registration of security-based swap dealers is first required pursuant to the applicable final rules and regulations; and

(ii) Security-based swap positions for which the non-U.S. person's counterparty to the security-based swap has rights of recourse against a U.S. person; for these purposes a counterparty has rights of recourse against the U.S. person if the counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right, in whole or in part, to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, the U.S. person in connection with the security-based swap.
