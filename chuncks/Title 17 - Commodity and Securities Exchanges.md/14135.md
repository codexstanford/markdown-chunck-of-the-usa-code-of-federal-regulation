###### At the time of an in-person transaction.

(4)The opt out notice is provided to the consumer in writing at the time of an in-person transaction. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction, and is not permitted to complete the transaction without making a choice. There is a simple process that the consumer may use during the course of the in-person transaction to opt out, such as completing a form that requires consumers to write a "yes" or "no" to indicate their opt out preference or that requires the consumer to check one of two blank check boxes-one that allows consumers to indicate that they want to opt out and one that allows consumers to indicate that they do not want to opt out.
