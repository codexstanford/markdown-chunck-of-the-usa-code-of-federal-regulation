###### Description of records sought.,http://www.sec.gov

(3)A FOIA request must reasonably describe the agency records sought with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates, and subject matter to enable personnel within the divisions and offices of the Commission to locate them with a reasonable effort. Before submitting a request, a requester may contact the Office of FOIA Services' FOIA Public Liaisons to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records (contact information for these individuals is on the Commission's website,). If the Office of FOIA Services determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or how the request is insufficient. A requester who is attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss the request with the Office of FOIA Services' designated FOIA contact, its FOIA Public Liaisons, or a representative of the Office of FOIA Services, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. When a requester fails to provide sufficient information within 30 calendar days after having been asked to reasonably describe the records sought, the Office of FOIA Services shall notify the requester in writing that the request has not been properly made, that no further action will be taken, and that the FOIA request is closed. Such a notice constitutes an adverse determination under paragraph (e)(2) of this section for which the Office of FOIA Services shall follow the procedures for a denial letter under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. In cases where a requester has modified his or her request so that it reasonably describes the requested records, the date of receipt for purposes of the 20-day time limit of paragraph (d) of this section shall be the date of receipt of the modified request.
