(2)If any party to the proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, or at any part thereof, the non-appearing party shall to that extent be deemed to have waived the opportunity for an oral hearing in the proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge, for just cause, may take such action as is appropriate pursuant to ยง 12.35 against a party who fails to appear at the hearing. In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the party who is present may present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony, before the Administrative Law Judge.
