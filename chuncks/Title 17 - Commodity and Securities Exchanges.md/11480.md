###### Notification of non-compliance or material weakness.

(h)If, during the course of preparing the independent public accountant's reports required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section, the independent public accountant determines that the broker or dealer is not in compliance with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-13 or any rule of the designated examining authority of the broker or dealer that requires account statements to be sent to the customers of the broker or dealer, as applicable, or the independent public accountant determines that any material weaknesses (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) exist, the independent public accountant must immediately notify the chief financial officer of the broker or dealer of the nature of the non-compliance or material weakness. If the notice from the accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a broker or dealer to provide a notification under § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-11, or if the notice concerns a material weakness, the broker or dealer must provide a notification in accordance with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-11, as applicable, and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public accountant. If the independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one business day, or if the independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notification, then the independent public accountant must notify the Commission and the designated examining authority within one business day. The report from the accountant must, if the broker or dealer failed to file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification under § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-11, or any material weaknesses. If the broker or dealer filed a notification, the report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the broker or dealer with which the accountant does not agree.
