###### Index of withheld documents.

(4)When documents are made available for inspection and copying pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Division of Enforcement shall furnish the respondents with an index of all documents that are withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, except for any documents that are being withheld because they disclose information obtained from a domestic or foreign governmental entity or from a foreign futures authority on condition that the information not be disclosed or that it only be disclosed by the Commission or a representative of the Commission as evidence in an enforcement or other proceeding, in which case the Division shall inform the other parties of the fact that such documents are being withheld at the time it furnishes its index under this paragraph, but no further disclosures regarding those documents shall be required. This index shall describe the nature of the withheld documents in a manner that, to the extent practicable without revealing any information that itself is privileged or protected from disclosure by law or these rules, will enable the other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection claimed.
