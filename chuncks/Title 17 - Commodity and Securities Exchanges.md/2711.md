(c)A registered leverage transaction merchant must submit to the Commission for its review, at least forty-five (45) days before their effective date, any proposed changes in the specifications of the leverage commodity and the terms and conditions of the leverage contract from those submitted as part of the registration application unless such contract specifically provides that such terms and conditions are subject to change.
