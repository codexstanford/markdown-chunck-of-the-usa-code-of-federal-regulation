###### Other performance of commodity pool operator.

(2)(i)(A) Except as provided in § 4.25(a)(8), the commodity pool operator must disclose, for the period specified by § 4.25(a)(5), the performance of each other pool operated by the pool operator (and by the trading manager if the offered pool has a trading manager) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (C) through (H) and (a)(3) of this § 4.25, and the performance of each other account traded by the pool operator (and by the trading manager if the offered pool has a trading manager) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) (C) through (G) of this § 4.25. If the trading manager has been delegated complete authority for the offered pool's trading, and the trading manager's performance is not materially different from that of the pool operator, the performance of the other pools operated by and accounts traded by the pool operator is not required to be disclosed.

(B) In addition, if the pool operator, or if applicable, the trading manager, has not operated for at least three years any commodity pool in which seventy-five percent or more of the contributions to the pool were made by persons unaffiliated with the commodity pool operator, the trading manager, the pool's commodity trading advisors or their respective principals, the pool operator must also disclose the performance of each other pool operated by and account traded by the trading principals of the pool operator (and of the trading manager, as applicable) unless such performance does not differ in any material respect from the performance of the offered pool and the pool operator (and trading manager, if any) disclosed in the Disclosure Document.

(ii) If neither the pool operator or trading manager (if any), nor any of its trading principals has operated any other pools or traded any other accounts, the pool operator must prominently display the following statement: NEITHER THIS POOL OPERATOR (TRADING MANAGER, IF APPLICABLE) NOR ANY OF ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAS PREVIOUSLY OPERATED ANY OTHER POOLS OR TRADED ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS. If the commodity pool operator or trading manager, if applicable, is a sole proprietorship, reference to its trading principals may be deleted from the prescribed statement.
