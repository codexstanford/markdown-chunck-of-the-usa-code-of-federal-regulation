#### ยง 46.3 Data reporting for pre-enactment swaps and transition swaps.
##### Voluntary early submission of initial data report.

(c)For all pre-enactment and transition swaps required to be reported pursuant to this part, the reporting counterparty may make the initial data report required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the data report required by paragraph (b) of this section, prior to the applicable compliance date, if a swap data repository accepting swaps in the asset class in question is prepared to accept the report. The obligation to report continuation data as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to a swap for which a voluntary early submission is made commences on the applicable compliance date. However, the reporting counterparty may submit continuation data at any time after a voluntary early submission made pursuant to this paragraph, if the swap data repository is prepared to accept such continuation data, and if that repository has registered with the Commission as a swap data repository as of the applicable compliance date.
