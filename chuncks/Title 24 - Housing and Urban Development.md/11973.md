####### Step 4.

(iv)A PHA with covered developments having average incomes outside the Established Income Range may explain or justify the income profile for these developments as being consistent with and furthering two sets of goals: the goals of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing as specified by the statute (bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and vice versa); and the local goals and strategies contained in the PHA Annual Plan.

(A) The covered development or developments are subject to consent decrees or other resident selection and admission plans mandated by court action;

(B) The covered development or developments are part of PHA's programs, strategies or activities specifically authorized by statute, such as mixed-income or mixed-finance developments, homeownership programs, self-sufficiency strategies, or other strategies designed to deconcentrate poverty, promote income mixing in public housing, increase the incomes of public housing residents, or the income mix is otherwise subject to individual review and approval by HUD;

(C) The covered development's or developments' size, location, and/or configuration promote income deconcentration, such as scattered site or small developments;

(D) The income characteristics of the covered development or developments are sufficiently explained by other circumstances.
