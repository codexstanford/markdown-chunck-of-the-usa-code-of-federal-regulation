####### Eligibility for continued occupancy.

15.a. The Homebuyer shall cease to be eligible for continued occupancy with the aid of HUD annual contributions when the Authority determines the Homebuyer's adjusted monthly income has reached, and is likely to continue at, a level at which the Homebuyer's total payment equals or exceeds the monthly housing cost (see paragraph b of this section). In such an event, if the Authority determines, with HUD approval, that suitable financing is available, the Authority shall notify the Homebuyer that he or she must either: (1) Purchase the Home; or (2) move from the Development. If, however, the Authority determines that, because of special circumstances, the family is unable to find decent, safe and sanitary housing within the family's financial reach although making every reasonable effort to do so, the family may be permitted to remain for the duration of such a situation if it pays as rent a monthly payment consistent with its adjusted monthly income, in accordance with applicable HUD regulations prescribing rental payments for families in housing assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Such a monthly payment shall also be payable by the family if it continues in occupancy without purchasing the home because suitable financing is not available.

b. The term "monthly housing cost," as used in this section means the sum of: (1) The monthly debt service amount shown on the Purchase Price Schedule (except where the Homebuyer can purchase the Home by the method described in section 16 below); (2) one-twelfth of the annual real property taxes which the Homebuyer will be required to pay as a Homeowner; (3) one-twelfth of the annual premium attributable to fire and extended coverage insurance carried by the Authority with respect to the Home; (4) the current monthly per unit amount budgeted for routine maintenance (EHPA) and routine maintenance-common property; and (5) the current Authority and HUD approved monthly allowance for utilities paid for directly by the Homebuyer plus the monthly cost of utilities supplied by the Authority.
