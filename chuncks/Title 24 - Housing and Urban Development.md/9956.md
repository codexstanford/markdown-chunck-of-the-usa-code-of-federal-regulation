(a)Housing assisted under this part must meet the applicable housing quality standards (HQS) under ยง 982.401 of this title-except that ยง 982.401(j) of this title does not apply and instead part 35, subparts A, B, K and R of this title apply-and, for SRO under ยง 882.803(b) of this title. Before any assistance will be provided on behalf of a participant, the recipient, or another entity acting on behalf of the recipient (other than the owner of the housing), must physically inspect each unit to assure that the unit meets the HQS. Assistance will not be provided for units that fail to meet the HQS, unless the owner corrects any deficiencies within 30 days from the date of the lease agreement and the recipient verifies that all deficiencies have been corrected. Recipients must also inspect all units at least annually during the grant period to ensure that the units continue to meet the HQS.
