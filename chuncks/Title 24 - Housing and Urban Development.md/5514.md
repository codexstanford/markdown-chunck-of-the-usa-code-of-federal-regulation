######### reasonable rate

(4)(i) As used in this section,means a rate that is not in excess of the rate or advisory rate set by the principal State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, or if coverage is available under a FAIR Plan, the FAIR Plan rate.

(ii) If a State has neither a FAIR Plan nor a State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, the mortgagee must provide to the HUD Field Office having jurisdiction, information concerning the lowest rates available from an insurer for the types of coverage involved, with a request for a determination of whether the rate is reasonable. HUD will determine the rate to be reasonable if it approximates the rate assessed for comparable insurance coverage applicable to similarly situated properties in a State that offers a FAIR Plan or maintains a State-licensed rating organization.

(b) For mortgages insured under firm commitments issued on or after November 19, 1992, or under direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 19, 1992, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply and, in addition, if the property has been damaged during the time of the mortgagee's possession by events other than fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or if it was damaged notwithstanding reasonable action by the mortgagee as required by § 203.377 of this part, the mortgagee must provide notice of such damage to the Secretary and may not convey until directed to do so by the Secretary. The Secretary will either:

(1) Allow the mortgagee to convey the property damaged; or

(2) Require the mortgagee to repair the damage before conveyance, and the Secretary will reimburse the mortgagee for reasonable payments not in excess of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair, less any insurance recovery.

(c) In the event the damaged property is conveyed to the Secretary without prior notice or approval as provided in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary may:

(1) After notice, reconvey the property to the mortgagee and the mortgagee must reimburse the Secretary in accordance with §§ 203.363 and 203.364 of this part, or

(2) Require the mortgagee to reimburse the Secretary for the greater of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair or any insurance recovery.
