(i) A conditional commitment issued on or after November 30, 1983 or, as appropriate,

(ii) An application for mortgage insurance endorsement under the Single Family Direct Endorsement Program, as provided in ยง 203.255(b), where the property appraisal report was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 30, 1983.

(2) The requirements of this section shall also apply to any other mortgages subject to this subpart where the mortgagee elects to provide the notice to HUD required by paragraph (d) of this section.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the requirements of this section do not apply if the mortgaged property has been damaged as set out in ยง 203.378.

(c) Nothing in this section shall affect any rights or obligations arising under the procedures set forth in subpart C of this part.

(d) After initiating proceedings to foreclose an insured mortgage within the coverage of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by judicial, statutory, or other means authorized by the mortgage instrument, the mortgagee shall furnish notice of the foreclosure to the Commissioner, containing such information as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner, together with a copy of the notice of sale, on or before the date of first publication, posting, or other notice. The mortgagee foreclosing an insured mortgage subject to this subpart and within the coverage of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may elect to become subject to this section by providing such notices to the Commissioner in accordance with the preceding sentence.

(e) Where notice of the foreclosure sale is provided pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the Commissioner may elect to cause the mortgaged property to be appraised and to give written notice to the mortgagee, not less than five days prior to the date of the foreclosure sale, of the Commissioner's estimate of the fair market value of the mortgaged property, less adjustments as the Commissioner may deem appropriate (which may include, without limitation, the Commissioner's estimate of holding costs and resale costs that would be incurred if title to the mortgaged property were conveyed to the Commissioner). Such amount is referred to hereafter as the "Commissioner's adjusted fair market value."
