####### Interim Plan for Demolition/Disposition.

(2)(i) Before submission of the first Annual Plan, a PHA may submit an interim PHA Annual Plan solely for demolition/disposition. The interim plan must provide:

(B) A certification of consistency with the Consolidated Plan;

(C) A description of how the plan is consistent with the Consolidated Plan;

(D) A relocation plan that includes the availability of units in the area and adequate funding; and

(E) Confirmation that a public hearing was held on the proposed action and that the resident advisory board was consulted.

(ii) Interim plans for demolition/disposition are subject to PHA Plan procedural requirements in this part (see §§ 903.13, 903.15, 903.17, 903.19, 903.21, 903.23, 903.25), with the following exception. If a resident advisory board has not yet been formed, the PHA may seek a waiver of the requirement to consult with the resident advisory board on the grounds that organizations that adequately represent residents for this purpose were consulted.

(iii) The actual application for demolition or disposition may be submitted at the same time as submission of the interim plan or at a later date.
