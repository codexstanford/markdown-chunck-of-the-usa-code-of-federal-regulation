###### Procedural requirements.

(2)In the event the Secretary determines that a GSE's prior year's fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report or AHAR contain a material error, omission or discrepancy, the Secretary will provide the GSE with an initial letter containing written findings and determinations within 24 months of the end of the relevant GSE reporting year. The GSE shall have an opportunity, not to exceed 30 days from the date of receipt of the Secretary's initial letter, to respond in writing with supporting documentation, to contest the Secretary's initial determination that there was a material error, omission or discrepancy in a prior year's data. The Secretary shall then issue a final determination letter within 60 days of the date of HUD's receipt of the GSE's written response or, if no response is received, within 90 days of the date of the GSE's receipt of the Secretary's initial letter. The Secretary may extend the period for issuing a final determination letter by an additional 30 days and may grant the GSE an opportunity, for a period not to exceed 10 working days from the date of the GSE's receipt of the determination letter to request that the determination be reconsidered.

(3) If the Secretary determines that a GSE's prior year's fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report or AHAR contained a material error, omission or discrepancy, the Secretary may direct the GSE to correct the overstatement by purchasing mortgages to finance the number of units that HUD has determined were overstated in the prior year's goal performance (or, for the Special Affordable subgoal, the number or dollar amount, as applicable, of mortgage purchases that HUD has determined were overstated), or that equal the percentage of the overstatement in the prior year's goal or Special Affordable subgoal performance as applied to the most current year-end performance, whichever is less. Units or mortgages purchased to remedy an overstatement in the housing goals or the Special Affordable subgoal must be eligible to qualify under the same goal or Special Affordable subgoal that HUD has determined were overstated in the prior year.

(4) If a GSE does not purchase a sufficient amount or type of mortgages to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section as directed by the Secretary by no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the year in which the Secretary notifies the GSE of such overstatement (unless, upon written request from the GSE, the Secretary, in his or her discretion, determines that a grant of additional time is appropriate to correct or compensate for the overstatement) the Department may pursue any or all of the following remedies:

(i) Issue a notice that the GSE has failed a housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal in the prior year;

(ii) Seek additional enforcement remedies under paragraph (e) of this section;

(iii) Pursue any other civil or administrative remedies as are available to it.
