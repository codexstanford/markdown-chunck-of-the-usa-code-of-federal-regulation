######## Grant ineligibility of included units of general local government.

(e)(1) An included unit of general local government cannot become eligible for an entitlement grant as a metropolitan city during the period of qualification of the urban county (even if it becomes a principal city of a metropolitan area or its population surpasses 50,000 during that period). Rather, such a unit of general local government shall continue to be included as part of the urban county for the remainder of the urban county's qualification period, and no separate grant amount shall be calculated for the included unit.

(2) An included unit of general local government which is part of an urban county shall be ineligible to apply for grants under subpart F, or to be a recipient of assistance under subpart I, during the entire period of urban county qualification.
