######## Increased Mortgage Limits-High Cost Areas.

(f)(1)(i) The Assistant Secretary may increase the dollar amount limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

(A) By not to exceed 110 percent in any geographical area in which the Assistant Secretary finds that cost levels so require; and

(B) By not to exceed 140 percent where the Assistant Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis.

(ii) In no case, however, may any such increase exceed 90 percent, where the Assistant Secretary determines that there is involved a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in implementing its Special Assistance Functions under section 305 of the National Housing Act (as section 305 existed immediately before its repeal on November 30, 1983).

(2) If the Assistant Secretary finds that because of high costs in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii it is not feasible to construct dwellings without the sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability within the limitations of maximum loan amounts provided in this section, the principal amount of mortgages may be increased by such amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such costs, but not to exceed in any event the maximum, including high cost area increases, if any, otherwise applicable by more than one-half thereof.
