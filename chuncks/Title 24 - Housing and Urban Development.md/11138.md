(c)In order to assure that housing assistance payments will be increased on a timely basis to cover increases in Contract Rents or decreases in Family Incomes:

(1) A Project Account shall be established and maintained, in an amount as determined by the Secretary consistent with his responsibilities under section 8(c)(6) of the Act, out of amounts by which the maximum annual Contract commitment per year exceeds amounts paid under the Contract for any year. This account shall be established and maintained by HUD for each project as a specifically identified and segregated account, and payment shall be made therefrom only for the purposes of (i) housing assistance payments, and (ii) other costs specifically authorized or approved by the Secretary.

(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required housing assistance payments for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual Contract commitment, and would cause the amount in the Project Account to be less than an amount equal to 40 percent of such maximum annual Contract commitment, HUD shall, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the Act as may be necessary to carry out this assurance, including (as provided in that section of the Act) "the allocation of a portion of new authorizations for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts."
