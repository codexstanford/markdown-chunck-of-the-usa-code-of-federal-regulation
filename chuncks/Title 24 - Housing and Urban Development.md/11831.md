####### ACC.

(2)The ACC makes a PHA legally responsible for all public housing operations, except where DF-RMC assumes management operations.

(i) Because the PHA and not the RMC or AME is ultimately responsible to HUD under the ACC, the PHAS score of a PHA will be based on all of the projects covered by the ACC, including those with management operations assumed by an RMC or AME (including a court-ordered or administrative receivership agreement, if applicable).

(ii) A PHA's PHAS score will not be based on projects managed by a DF-RMC.

(3) This part does not apply to Moving-to-Work (MTW) agencies that are specifically exempted in their grant agreement.
