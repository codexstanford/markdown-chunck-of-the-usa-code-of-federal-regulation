######## Qualification as an urban county.

(b)(1) A county will qualify as an urban county if such county meets the definition at ยง 570.3(3). As necessitated by this definition, the Secretary shall determine which counties have authority to carry out essential community development and housing assistance activities in their included units of general local government without the consent of the local governing body and which counties must execute cooperation agreements with such units to include them in the urban county for qualification and grant calculation purposes.

(2) At the time of urban county qualification, HUD may refuse to recognize the cooperation agreement of a unit of general local government in an urban county where, based on past performance and other available information, there is substantial evidence that such unit does not cooperate in the implementation of the essential community development or housing assistance activities or where legal impediments to such implementation exist, or where participation by a unit of general local government in noncompliance with the applicable law in subpart K would constitute noncompliance by the urban county. In such a case, the unit of general local government will not be permitted to participate in the urban county, and its population or other needs characteristics will not be considered in the determination of whether the county qualifies as an urban county or in determining the amount of funds to which the urban county may be entitled. HUD will not take this action unless the unit of general local government and the county have been given an opportunity to challenge HUD's determination and to informally consult with HUD concerning the proposed action.
