####### Public services.

(e)Provision of public services (including labor, supplies, materials, and the purchase of personal property and furnishings) which are directed toward improving the community's public services and facilities, including but not limited to those concerned with employment, crime prevention, child care, health, drug abuse, education, fair housing counseling, energy conservation, welfare (but excluding the provision of income payments identified under ยง 1003.207(b)(4)), homebuyer downpayment assistance or recreational needs. To be eligible for ICDBG assistance, a public service must be either a new service, or a quantifiable increase in the level of an existing service above that which has been provided by or on behalf of the grantee through funds raised by the grantee, or received by the grantee from the Federal government in the twelve calendar months before the submission of the application for ICDBG assistance. (An exception to this requirement may be made if HUD determines that any decrease in the level of a service was the result of events not within the control of the grantee.) The amount of ICDBG funds used for public services shall not exceed 15 percent of the grant. Such projects must therefore be submitted with one or more other projects, which must comprise at least 85 percent of the total requested ICDBG grant amount.
