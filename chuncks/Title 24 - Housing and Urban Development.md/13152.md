####### Contractual requirements for insurance coverage.

(a)The Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) between PHAs and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires that PHAs maintain specified insurance coverage for property and casualty losses that would jeopardize the financial stability of the PHAs. The insurance coverage is required to be obtained under procedures that provide "for open and competitive bidding." The HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 provided that a PHA could purchase insurance coverage without regard to competitive selection procedures when it purchases it from a nonprofit insurance entity owned and controlled by PHAs approved by HUD in accordance with standards established by regulation. This section specifies the standards.
