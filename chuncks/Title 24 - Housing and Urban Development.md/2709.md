If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with all or any portion of a subpoena issued pursuant to this paragraph (f), the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved person may petition the Secretary to seek enforcement of the subpoena. A party's petition to the Secretary for enforcement of a subpoena in no way limits the sanctions that may be imposed by the ALJ on a party who fails to comply with a subpoena issued under this paragraph (f).
