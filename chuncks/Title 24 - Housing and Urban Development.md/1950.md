###### Worksite clearance.

(g)Clearance of only the worksite is permitted after work covered by §§ 35.930, 35.1330, 35.1335, or 35.1355, when containment is used to ensure that dust and debris generated by the work is kept within the worksite. Otherwise, clearance must be of the entire dwelling unit, common area, or outbuilding, as applicable. When clearance is of an interior worksite that is not an entire dwelling unit, common area, or outbuilding, dust samples shall be taken for paragraph (b) of this section as follows:

(1) Sample, from each of at least four rooms, hallways, stairwells, or common areas within the dust containment area:

(i) The floor (one sample); and

(ii) Windows (one interior sill sample and one trough sample, if present); and

(2) Sample the floor in a room, hallway, stairwell, or common area connected to the dust containment area, within five feet outside the area (one sample).
