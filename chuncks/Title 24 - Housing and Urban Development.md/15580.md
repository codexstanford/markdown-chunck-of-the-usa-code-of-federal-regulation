###### ยง 3280.402 Test procedures for roof trusses.
####### Roof load tests.

(a)This section provides the roof truss test procedure for vertical loading conditions. Where roof trusses act as support for other members, have eave or cornice projections, or support concentrated loads, roof trusses must also be tested for those conditions. These test procedures are required for new truss designs in all three wind zones and for existing truss designs used in Wind Zones II and III.
