######## Projects not covered by an insured or Secretary-held mortgage.

(h)In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, projects which are not covered by an insured project mortgage or by a Secretary-held mortgage and which have not been approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs for its guaranty, insurance, or direct loan programs shall meet the requirements of this paragraph. Except with the approval of the Commissioner for the purpose of constructing or converting the project in phases or stages, any special right of the declarant (as declarant and not as a unit owner) to do any or all of the following must have expired or must have been waived in a recorded instrument:

(1) Add land or units to the condominium;

(2) Convert common elements into additional units or limited common elements;

(3) Withdraw land from the condominium;

(4) Use easements through the common elements for the purpose of making improvements within the condominium or within any adjacent land; or

(5) Convert a unit into two or more units, common elements, or into two or more units and common elements.

(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, a loan on a single unit in an unapproved condominium project (spot loan) may qualify for mortgage insurance under this part.

(1) The project must meet the following criteria:

(i) All units, common elements, and facilities-including those that are part of any master association-must have been completed, and the project cannot be subject to additional phasing or annexation. The project must provide for undivided ownership of common areas by unit owners;

(ii) Control of the owners' association must have been turned over to the unit purchasers, and the unit purchasers must have been in control for at least one year;

(iii) At least 90 percent of the total units in the project must have been conveyed to the unit purchasers, and at least 51 percent of the total units in the project must have been conveyed to purchasers who are occupying the units as their principal residences or second homes. No single entity (the same individual, investor group, partnership, or corporation) may own more than 10 percent of the total units in the project;

(iv) The units in the project must be owned in fee simple or be an eligible leasehold interest, as described in ยง 234.65, and the unit owners must have sole ownership interest in, and right to the use of, the project's facilities, common elements, and limited common elements including parking, recreational facilities, etc.;

(v) The project must be covered by hazard, flood, and liability insurance acceptable to the Commissioner;

(vi) For projects with more than 30 units, no more than 10 percent of the total units in the project may be encumbered by FHA-insured mortgages. (If endorsement would result in more than 10 percent of the units in such a project being encumbered by FHA-insured mortgages, the condominium project must be approved under paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section.) For projects with between 5 and 30 units inclusive, no more than 20 percent of the total units may be encumbered by FHA-insured mortgages. For projects with four units, only one unit may be encumbered by an FHA-insured mortgage under the spot loan procedure of this paragraph (i); and

(vii) The assumability provisions of ยง 234.66 must be satisfied.

(2) Lenders must perform an underwriting analysis and certify that a project satisfies the eligibility criteria for a spot loan in a condominium project that has not been approved by FHA. Lenders may use information from the appraiser, the owners' association, the management company, the real estate broker, and the project developer, but the lender must ensure the accuracy of the information obtained from these sources.
