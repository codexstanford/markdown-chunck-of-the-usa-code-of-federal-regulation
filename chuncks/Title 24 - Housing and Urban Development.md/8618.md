######## Student stipend.

(A)The amount of the student stipend is based upon the prevailing hourly rate for initial entry positions in community building and the number of hours worked by the student at the work placement assignment, except that the hourly rate used should be sufficiently high to allow a student to earn the full stipend without working over 20 hours per week during the school year and 40 hours per week during the summer. The amount of the stipend the student receives may not exceed the actual amount earned, up to $9,000 per year.
