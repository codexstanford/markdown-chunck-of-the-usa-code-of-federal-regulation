(a) Housing assistance for non-low-income families requires HUD approval only as required in §§ 1000.108 and 1000.110.

(b) Assistance for essential families under section 201(b)(3) of NAHASDA does not require HUD approval but only requires that the recipient determine that the presence of that family on the reservation or Indian area is essential to the well-being of Indian families and that the family's housing needs cannot be reasonably met without such assistance.
