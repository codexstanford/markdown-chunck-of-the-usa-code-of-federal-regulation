######## Limited clientele activities.

(2)(i) An activity which benefits a limited clientele, at least 51 percent of whom are low and moderate income persons. The following kinds of activities may not qualify under paragraph (b)(2) of this section:

(A) Activities, the benefits of which are available to all the residents of an area;

(B) Activities involving the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of property for housing; or

(C) Activities where the benefit to low- and moderate-income persons to be considered is the creation or retention of jobs, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.

(ii) To qualify under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the activity must meet one or the following tests:

(A) It must benefit a clientele who are generally presumed to be principally low and moderate income persons. Activities that exclusively serve a group of persons in any one or a combination of the following categories may be presumed to benefit persons, 51 percent of whom are low and moderate income: abused children, battered spouses, elderly persons, adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of "severely disabled," homeless persons, illiterate adults, persons living with AIDS, and migrant farm workers; or

(B) It must require information on family size and income so that it is evident that at least 51 percent of the clientele are persons whose family income does not exceed the low and moderate income limit; or

(C) It must have income eligibility requirements which limit the activity exclusively to low and moderate income persons; or

(D) It must be of such a nature, and be in such a location, that it may be concluded that the activity's clientele will primarily be low and moderate income persons.

(iii) An activity that serves to remove material or architectural barriers to the mobility or accessibility of elderly persons or of adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of "severely disabled" will be presumed to qualify under this criterion if it is restricted, to the extent practicable, to the removal of such barriers by assisting:

(A) The reconstruction of a public facility or improvement, or portion thereof, that does not qualify under § 570.483(b)(1);

(B) The rehabilitation of a privately owned nonresidential building or improvement that does not qualify under § 570.483(b) (1) or (4); or

(C) The rehabilitation of the common areas of a residential structure that contains more than one dwelling unit and that does not qualify under § 570.483(b)(3).

(iv) A microenterprise assistance activity (carried out in accordance with the provisions of section 105(a)(23) of the Act or § 570.482(c) and limited to microenterprises) with respect to those owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises assisted under the activity who are low- and moderate-income persons. For purposes of this paragraph, persons determined to be low and moderate income may be presumed to continue to qualify as such for up to a three-year period.

(v) An activity designed to provide job training and placement and/or other employment support services, including, but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services, in which the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons assisted is less than 51 percent may qualify under this paragraph in the following limited circumstances:

(A) In such cases where such training or provision of supportive services is an integrally-related component of a larger project, the only use of CDBG assistance for the project is to provide the job training and/or supportive services; and

(B) The proportion of the total cost of the project borne by CDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of the total number of persons assisted who are low or moderate income.
