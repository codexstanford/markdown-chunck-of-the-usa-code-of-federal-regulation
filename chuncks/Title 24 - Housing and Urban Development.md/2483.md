##### ยง 81.2 Definitions.
###### Mortgages contrary to good lending practices

means a mortgage or a group or category of mortgages entered into by a lender and purchased by a GSE where it can be shown that a lender engaged in a practice of failing to:

(1) Report monthly on borrowers' repayment history to credit repositories on the status of each GSE loan that a lender is servicing;

(2) Offer mortgage applicants products for which they qualify, but rather steer applicants to high cost products that are designed for less credit worthy borrowers. Similarly, for consumers who seek financing through a lender's higher-priced subprime lending channel, lenders should not fail to offer or direct such consumers toward the lender's standard mortgage line if they are able to qualify for one of the standard products;

(3) Comply with fair lending requirements; or

(4) Engage in other good lending practices that are:

(i) Identified in writing by a GSE as good lending practices for inclusion in this definition; and

(ii) Determined by the Secretary to constitute good lending practices.
