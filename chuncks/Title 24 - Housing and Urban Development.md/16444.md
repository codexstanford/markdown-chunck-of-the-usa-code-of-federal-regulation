###### ยง 3285.302 Flood hazard areas.

In flood hazard areas, foundations, anchorings, and support systems must be capable of resisting loads associated with design flood and wind events or combined wind and flood events, and homes must be installed on foundation supports that are designed and anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. Manufacturer's installation instructions must indicate whether:

(a) The foundation specifications have been designed for flood-resistant considerations, and, if so, the conditions of applicability for velocities, depths, or wave action; or

(b) The foundation specifications are not designed to address flood loads.
