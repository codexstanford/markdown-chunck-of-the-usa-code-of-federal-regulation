###### Time of request.

(3)Failure to file with the Secretary a timely request or a reply is deemed a waiver of any objection regarding the decision on whether a document is to be disclosed. A party must make its request to file a document under seal at least 10 days before the commencement of the hearing. A request may be filed at any other time before or during the course of the hearing, but the requesting party's obligation to produce the document or parts of the document will not be affected by the party's pending request to the Secretary, unless the Secretary expressly directs the ALJ to treat the document as protected from disclosure until the Secretary makes a final written decision on whether the document should be filed under seal. If the Secretary's direction to the ALJ is made orally, that direction must be reduced to writing and filed with the ALJ within 3 working days of the making of the oral order or the document will then be subject to disclosure pending the Secretary's final written decision on disclosure.
