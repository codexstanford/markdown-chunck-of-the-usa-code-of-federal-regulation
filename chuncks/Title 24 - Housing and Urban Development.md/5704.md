######## Expected average mortgage interest rate

means the interest rate used to calculate the principal limit established at closing.

(1) For fixed interest rate HECMs, the expected average mortgage interest rate is the same as the fixed mortgage (Note) interest rate and is set simultaneously with the fixed interest (Note) rate.

(2) For adjustable interest rate HECMs, the expected average mortgage interest rate is the sum of the mortgagee's margin plus the weekly average yield for U.S. Treasury securities (CMT) adjusted to a constant maturity of 10 years or an additional SOFR index as approved by the Secretary. Commingling the index type used to calculate the expected average mortgage interest rate and the index type used to calculate the adjustable mortgage interest (Note) rate and adjustments is only permissible as provided for by the Secretary.

(3) Mortgagees, with the agreement of the borrower, may simultaneously lock in the expected average mortgage interest rate and the mortgagee's margin prior to the date of mortgage closing or simultaneously establish the expected average mortgage interest rate and the mortgagee's margin on the date of mortgage closing.
