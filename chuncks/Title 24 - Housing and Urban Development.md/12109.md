####### Transfer to homeowners association.

(d)The LHA shall be responsible for and shall retain custody of the operating reserve until the homeowners acquire voting control of the homeowners association (see §§ 904.118(c) and 904.119(f). When the homeowners acquire voting control, the homeowners association shall then assume full responsibility for management and maintenance of common property under a plan approved by HUD, and there shall be transferred to the homeowners association a portion of the operating reserve then held by the LHA. The amount of the reserve to be transferred shall be based upon the proportion that one-half of budgeted routine expense (used as a basis for determining the current maximum operating reserve-see paragraph (c) of this section) bears to the approved maximum operating reserve. Specifically, the portion of operating reserve to be transferred shall be computed as follows: Obtain a percentage by dividing one-half of budgeted routine expense by the approved maximum operating reserve; and multiply the actual operating reserve balance by this percentage.
