(iv)The adjustable interest rate mortgage initial contract interest rate shall be agreed upon by the mortgagee and the borrower. The first adjustment to the contract interest rate shall take place in accordance with the schedule set forth under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Thereafter, for all annual adjustable interest rate mortgages, the adjustment shall be made annually and shall occur on the anniversary date of the first adjustment, subject to the following conditions and limitations:

(A) For all annual adjustable interest rate HECMs, no single adjustment to the interest rate shall result in a change in either direction of more than two percentage points from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of two percentage points may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment for a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.

(B) At each adjustment date for annual adjustable interest rate HECMs, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, except that the mortgage may provide for minimum interest rate change limitations and for minimum increments of interest rate changes.
