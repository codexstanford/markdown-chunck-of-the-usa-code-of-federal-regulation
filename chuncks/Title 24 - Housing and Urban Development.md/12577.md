###### ยง 905.604 Mixed-finance development.
####### General.

(a)Mixed-finance development refers to the development (through new construction or acquisition, with or without rehabilitation) or modernization of public housing, where the public housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than a PHA. If the public housing units being developed are 100 percent owned by the PHA, the project is not a mixed-finance project and will be not be subject to mixed-finance development requirements. However, all other development requirements of part 905 are applicable, and, if the project includes both public housing funds and private funding for development, the project may be subject to other applicable program requirements; e.g., the Capital Fund Financing Program, Operating Fund Financing Program, Public Housing Mortgage Program, etc.
