####### Scoring.

(a)(1) Under the financial condition indicator, a score will be calculated for each project based on the values of financial condition subindicators and an overall financial condition score, as well as audit and internal control flags. Each financial condition subindicator has several levels of performance, with different point values for each level.

(2) The financial condition score for projects will be based on the annual financial condition information submitted to HUD for each project under 24 CFR 990.280 and 990.285. The financial condition score for PHAs will be based on a unit-weighted average of project scores.
