####### Scope.

(b)The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. Discovery shall be conducted as expeditiously and inexpensively as possible, consistent with the needs of all parties to obtain relevant evidence. Unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ, the parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceeding, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of documents or persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not grounds for objection that information sought will be inadmissible if the information appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
