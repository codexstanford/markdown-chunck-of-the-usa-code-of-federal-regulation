####### Low and moderate income beneficiary

means a family, household, or individual whose income does not exceed 80 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for smaller and larger households or families. However, HUD may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 percent of the median for the area on the basis of HUD's findings that such variations are necessary because of unusually high or low household or family incomes. In reporting income levels to HUD, the applicant must include and identify the distributions of tribal or village income to families, households, or individuals.
