######## One applicant for a Continuum.

(2)If a Continuum designates only one applicant for the geographic area, after awarding funds, HUD may enter into a grant agreement with that applicant for new awards, if any, and one grant agreement for renewals, Continuum of Care planning, and UFA costs, if any. These two grants will cover the entire geographic area. A default by the recipient under one of those grant agreements will also be a default under the other.
