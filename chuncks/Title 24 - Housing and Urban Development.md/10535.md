####### Reexamination of tenant income and composition.

(f)(1) The owner shall reexamine the income of each tenant household living in low-income units at least once a year. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995 the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 812 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 812 concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.

(2) If this reexamination indicates that the tenant no longer qualifies as a low-income household, the owner must take one of the following actions, as appropriate: (i) If the unit occupied by the tenant must be leased to a low- income household to maintain the percentage of low-income units specified in the grant agreement, the owner must notify the tenant that it must move when the current lease expires or six months after the date of the notification, whichever is later; (ii) If the owner can meet this percentage without the unit occupied by the tenant (for example, by designating another comparable unit as a low-income unit), the owner may continue to lease to that tenant, but is free to renegotiate the rent at the expiration of the current lease.

(3) For provisions related to termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR 812.9, and also 24 CFR 812.10 for provisions related to certain assistance to mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions related to deferral of termination of assistance.
