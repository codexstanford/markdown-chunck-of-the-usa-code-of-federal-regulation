###### ยง 1000.546 Are audit costs eligible program or administrative expenses?

Yes, audit costs are an eligible program or administrative expense. If the Indian tribe is the recipient then program funds can be used to pay a prorated share of the tribal audit or financial review cost that is attributable to NAHASDA funded activities. For a recipient not covered by the Single Audit Act, but which chooses to obtain a periodic financial review, the cost of such a review would be an eligible program expense.
