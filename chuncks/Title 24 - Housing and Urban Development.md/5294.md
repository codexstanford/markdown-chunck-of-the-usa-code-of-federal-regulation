######### Acceptable security.

(e)Any agreement by the Secretary to accept alternative security under paragraph (d)(3) of this section must contain provisions designed to ensure that the insurance of mortgages under this section has a neutral impact on the appropriate insurance funds. These provisions may require the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to make an initial deposit of funds with HUD and to maintain additional funds in reserve for subsequent deposits with HUD. The initial and subsequent deposits shall be used to pay obligations incurred by HUD in connection with the insurance of mortgages under this section and any associated costs, including refunds of insurance premiums to mortgagors. If the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands agrees to make deposits in amounts acceptable to HUD, then the Secretary may agree to use a portion of the premiums received for insurance of mortgages under this section solely for payment of such obligations and associated costs.
