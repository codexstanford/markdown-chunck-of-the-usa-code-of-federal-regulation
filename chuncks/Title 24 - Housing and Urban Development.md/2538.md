() The most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act if the lending institutions which have total assets no more than $250 million are identified as sellers that are presumed to have a primary business of originating mortgages on housing that qualifies under this Special Affordable Housing Goal and, therefore, are presumed to meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv) of this section.

(vii) Classes of institutions or organizations that are presumed have as their primary business originating mortgages on housing that qualifies under this Special Affordable Housing Goal and, therefore. are presumed in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv) of this section to meet the requirements are as follows: State housing finance agencies; affordable housing loan consortia; Federally insured credit unions that are:

(A) Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and meet the first-time homebuyer standard of the Community Support Program; or

(B) Community development credit unions; community development financial institutions; public loan funds; or non-profit mortgage lenders. HUD may determine that additional classes of institutions or organizations are primarily engaged in the business of financing affordable housing mortgages for purposes of this presumption, and if, so will notify the GSEs in writing.

(viii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, if the seller did not originate the mortgage loans, but the originator of the mortgage loans fulfills the requirements of either paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv), paragraph (e)(4)(vi) or paragraph (e)(4)(vii) of this section; and the seller has held the loans for six months or less prior to selling the loans to the GSE, HUD will consider that the seller has met the requirements of this paragraph (e)(4) and of 12 U.S.C. 4563(b)(1)(B).
