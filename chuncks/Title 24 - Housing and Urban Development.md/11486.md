## Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Housing and Urban Development
### Chapter VIII - Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, Department of Housing and Urban Development (Section 8 Housing Assistance Programs, Section 202 Direct Loan Program, Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program and Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program)
#### PART 891 - SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
##### Subpart A - General Program Requirements
###### ยง 891.185 Preemption of rent control laws.

The Department finds that it is necessary and desirable to assist project owners to preserve the continued viability of each project assisted under this part (except subpart E) as a housing resource for very low-income elderly persons or persons with disabilities. The Department also finds that it is necessary to protect the substantial economic interest of the Federal Government in those projects. Therefore, the Department concludes that it is in the national interest to preempt, and it does hereby preempt, the entire field of rent regulation by local rent control boards or other authority acting pursuant to state or local law as it affects those projects. Part 246 of this title applies to projects covered by subpart E of this part.
