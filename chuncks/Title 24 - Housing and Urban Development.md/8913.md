(b) Records demonstrating that each activity undertaken meets one of the criteria set forth in § 570.208. (Where information on income by family size is required, the recipient may substitute evidence establishing that the person assisted qualifies under another program having income qualification criteria at least as restrictive as that used in the definitions of "low and moderate income person" and "low and moderate income household" (as applicable) at § 570.3, such as Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) and welfare programs; or the recipient may substitute evidence that the assisted person is homeless; or the recipient may substitute a copy of a verifiable certification from the assisted person that his or her family income does not exceed the applicable income limit established in accordance with § 570.3; or the recipient may substitute a notice that the assisted person is a referral from a state, county or local employment agency or other entity that agrees to refer individuals it determines to be low and moderate income persons based on HUD's criteria and agrees to maintain documentation supporting these determinations.)
