####### Circumstances under which the conflict prohibition does not apply.

(e)(1) In instances where a person who might otherwise be deemed to be included under the conflict prohibition is a member of a group or class of beneficiaries of the assisted activity and receives generally the same interest or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class, the prohibition does not apply, except that if, by not applying the prohibition against conflict of interest, a violation of Tribal or State laws on conflict of interest would result, the prohibition does apply. However, if the assistance to be provided is housing rehabilitation (or repair) or new housing, a public disclosure of the nature of the assistance to be provided and the specific basis for the selection of the proposed beneficiaries must be made prior to the submission of an application to HUD. Evidence of this disclosure must be provided as a component of the application.
