(a)HUD will review the performance of each participating jurisdiction in carrying out its responsibilities under this part whenever determined necessary by HUD, but at least annually. In conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the participating jurisdiction's and, as appropriate, the State recipient's records and reports, findings from on-site monitoring, audit reports, and information generated from the disbursement and information system established by HUD. Where applicable, HUD may also consider relevant information pertaining to a participating jurisdiction's or State recipient's performance gained from other sources, including citizen comments, complaint determinations, and litigation. Reviews to determine compliance with specific requirements of this part will be conducted as necessary, with or without prior notice to the participating jurisdiction or State recipient. Comprehensive performance reviews under the standards in paragraph (b) of this section will be conducted after prior notice to the participating jurisdiction.
