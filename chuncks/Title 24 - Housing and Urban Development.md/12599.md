####### Preparation of an Alternative Management Plan.

(2)Should the PHA and the Owner Entity determine a need to deviate from the Public Housing Requirements, the PHA, on behalf of the Owner Entity, must submit an Alternative Management Plan to HUD for review and approval prior to implementation of any changes. The Plan must include the following:

(i) A statement describing the Owner Entity's reasons for deviating from the Public Housing Requirements;

(ii) An explanation of the Owner Entity's proposed remedies, including, but not limited to:

(A) How the Owner Entity will select the residents (including the number and income levels of the families proposed to be admitted to the public housing units) and units to be affected by the proposed change;

(B) The Owner Entity's timetable for implementing the Alternative Management Plan;

(C) The impact on existing residents. Note that for any resident who is unable to remain in the unit as a result of implementation of the Alternative Management Plan, the resident must be relocated to a public housing unit or given a Housing Choice Voucher by the PHA or by another entity as provided for in the contractual agreement between the PHA and the Owner Entity;

(iii) An amendment to the existing contractual agreement between the PHA and the Owner Entity that includes provisions which ensure that:

(A) An update on the Alternative Management Plan is submitted annually to HUD to ensure that implementation of the provisions of the Alternative Management Plan continue to be appropriate;

(B) The Owner Entity complies with the requirements of this subpart in its management and operation of the public housing units in accordance with the Alternative Management Plan;

(C) The Owner Entity provides the PHA any income that is generated by the public housing units in excess of the Owner Entity's expenses on behalf of those units, as a result of implementation of provisions in the Alternative Management Plan;

(D) The Owner Entity reinstates all Public Housing Requirements (including rent and income eligibility requirements) with respect to the original number of public housing units and number of bedrooms in the mixed-finance development, following the PHA's reinstatement of operating subsidies at the level originally agreed to in its contract with the Owner Entity; and

(iv) Additional evidence. The PHA must provide documentation that:

(A) The Owner Entity has provided copies of the Alternative Management Plan to residents of the project and provided the opportunity for review and comment prior to submission to HUD. The Owner Entity must have provided written notice to each of the public housing residents in the mixed-finance development of its intention to implement the Alternative Management Plan. Such notice must comply with all relevant federal, state, and local substantive and procedural requirements and, at a minimum, provide public housing residents 90 days advance notice of any proposal to increase rents or to relocate public housing residents to alternative housing;

(B) The revenues being generated by the public housing units (in combination with the reduced allocation of Operating Subsidy resulting primarily from a reduction in appropriations or changes in applicable law such that the PHA is unable to comply with its contractual obligations to the Owner Entity) are inadequate to cover the reasonable and necessary operating expenses of the public housing units. Documentation should include a financial statement showing actual operating expenses and revenues over the past 5 years and the projected expenses and revenues over the next 10 years;

(C) A demonstration that the PHA cannot meet its contractual obligation, and;

(D) The Owner Entity has attempted to offset with regard to the project, the impact of reduced operating subsidies or changes in applicable law by all available means; including the use of other public and private development resources, the use of cash flow from any nonpublic housing units, and funds from other operating deficient reserves.
