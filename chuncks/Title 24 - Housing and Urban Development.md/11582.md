######## Project occupancy requirements

means that eligible populations to be served under the Section 202 program are qualified individuals or families whose head of household or spouse is elderly, physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, or chronically mentally ill. Projects are designed to meet the special needs of the particular tenant population that the Borrower was selected to serve. Individuals from one eligible group may not be accepted for occupancy in a project designed for a different tenant group. However, a Sponsor can propose to house eligible tenant groups other than the one it was selected to serve, but must apply to the HUD field office for permission to do so, based on a plan that demonstrates that it can adequately serve the proposed tenant group. Upon review and recommendation by the field office, HUD Headquarters will approve or disapprove the request.
