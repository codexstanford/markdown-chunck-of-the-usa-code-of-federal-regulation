####### Review of program description.

(a)The responsible HUD Field Office will review an insular area's program description and will approve the description unless the insular area has failed to submit information sufficient to allow HUD to make the necessary determinations required for ยง 92.61 (b)(4), (b)(6), and (b)(7), or the guidelines under (b)(8) are not satisfactory to HUD, if applicable; or if the level of proposed projects or eligible activities is not within the management capability demonstrated by past performance in housing and community development programs. If the insular area has not submitted information on ยง 92.61 (b)(4), (b)(6), and (b)(7), or the guidelines under (b)(8) are not satisfactory to HUD, if applicable; or if the level of proposed projects or eligible activities is not within the management capability demonstrated by past performance in housing and community development programs, the insular area may be required to furnish such further information or assurances as HUD may consider necessary to find the program description and certifications satisfactory. The HUD Field Office shall work with the insular area to achieve a complete and satisfactory program description.
