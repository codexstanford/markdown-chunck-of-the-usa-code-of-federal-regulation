####### Voting control.

(d)The LHA shall not lose its majority voting interest in the association as soon as a majority of the homes have been conveyed, unless the law of the state requires control to be transferred at a particular time, or the LHA so desires. If permitted by state law, provision shall be made for each home owned by the LHA to carry three votes, while each home owned by a homeowner shall carry one vote. Under this weighted voting plan, the LHA shall continue to have voting control until 75 percent of the homes have been acquired by homeowners. However, at its discretion, the LHA may transfer voting control to the homeowners when at least 50 percent of the homes have been acquired by the homeowners.
