(B) The GSE assumes a credit risk in the transaction substantially equivalent to the risk that would have been assumed by the GSE if it had securitized the mortgages financed by such bonds; and

(C) Such dwelling units otherwise qualify under this part.

(ii) When a GSE provides a specific contractual obligation to ensure timely payment of amounts due under any mortgage originally insured by a public purpose mortgage insurance entity or fund, the GSE may, on a case-by-case basis, seek approval from the Secretary for such activities to count toward achievement of the housing goals.
