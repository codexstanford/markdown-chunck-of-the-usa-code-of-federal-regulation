######## Project assistance payment

means the payment made by HUD to the Borrower for assisted units as provided in the PAC. The payment is the difference between the contract rent and the tenant rent. An additional payment is made to a family occupying an assisted unit in an independent living complex when the utility allowance is greater than the total tenant payment. A project assistance payment, known as a "vacancy payment," may be made to the Borrower when an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) is vacant, in accordance with the terms of the PAC.
