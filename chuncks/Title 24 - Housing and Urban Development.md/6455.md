(a)The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation of not in excess of eighty-five percent (85%) for a profit motivated borrower (ninety percent (90%) for a private nonprofit borrower) of the Commissioner's estimate of the value of the project, including major movable equipment to be used in its operation and any repairs and improvements. The Commissioner's estimate of value shall result from consideration of:

(3) Total estimated replacement cost of the Project.

In the event the mortgage is secured by a leasehold estate rather than a fee simple estate, the value of the property described in the mortgage shall be the value of the leasehold estate (as determined by the Commissioner) which shall in all cases be less than the value of the property in fee simple.
