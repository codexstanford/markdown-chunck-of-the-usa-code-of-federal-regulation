####### Units not decent, safe, and sanitary.

(d)If HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) notifies the Owner that he has failed to maintain a dwelling unit in Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition and the Owner fails to take corrective action within the time prescribed in the notice, HUD (or the PHA) may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the Contract, including abatement of housing assistance payments, even if the Family continues to occupy the unit. If, however, the Family wishes to be rehoused in another dwelling unit with Section 8 assistance and HUD (or the PHA) does not have other Section 8 funds for such purposes, HUD (or the PHA) may use the abated housing assistance payments for the purpose of rehousing the Family in another dwelling unit. Where this is done, the Owner shall be notified that he will be entitled to resumption of housing assistance payments for the vacated dwelling unit if:

(1) The unit is restored to Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition;

(2) The Family is willing to and does move back to the restored dwelling unit; and

(3) A deduction is made for the expenses incurred by the Family for both moves.
