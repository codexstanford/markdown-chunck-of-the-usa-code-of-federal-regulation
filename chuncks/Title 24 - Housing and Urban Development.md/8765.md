(2)The underwriting guidelines are designed to provide the recipient with a framework for financially underwriting and selecting CDBG-assisted economic development projects which are financially viable and will make the most effective use of the CDBG funds. Where appropriate, HUD's underwriting guidelines recognize that different levels of review are appropriate to take into account differences in the size and scope of a proposed project, and in the case of a microenterprise or other small business to take into account the differences in the capacity and level of sophistication among businesses of differing sizes. Recipients are encouraged, when they develop their own programs and underwriting criteria, to also take these factors into account. These underwriting guidelines are published as appendix A to this part. The objectives of the underwriting guidelines are to ensure:

(i) That project costs are reasonable;

(ii) That all sources of project financing are committed;

(iii) That to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are not substituted for non-Federal financial support;

(iv) That the project is financially feasible;

(v) That to the extent practicable, the return on the owner's equity investment will not be unreasonably high; and

(vi) That to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are disbursed on a pro rata basis with other finances provided to the project.
