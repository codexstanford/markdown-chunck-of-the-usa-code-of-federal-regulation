######## HFA right to informal hearing.

(d)(1) Any sanction imposed by a designated office in writing will be immediately effective, will state the grounds for the action, and provide for the HFA's right to an informal hearing before the designated office representative or designee in the designated office. The HFA may request an informal hearing within 10 working days of receipt of the suspension or withdrawal action and the Designated Office shall give the HFA an opportunity to be heard within 10 working days of receipt of the HFA's request. The HFA may be represented by counsel. The Designated Office Representative, or his or her designee, will advise the HFA in writing of the decision within 10 working days of the informal hearing, which decision will constitute final HUD action.
