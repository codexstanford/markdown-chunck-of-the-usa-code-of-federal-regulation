###### ยง 883.308 Adjustments to reflect changes in terms of financing.
####### Increase of Contract Rents.

(e)This paragraph (e) applies only if the HFA is using its set-aside for the project and it is processed under subpart D. If the actual debt service to the owner under the permanent financing is higher than the anticipated debt service on which the Contract Rents are based, the initial Contract Rents or the Contract Rents currently in effect may, if sufficient contract and budget authority is available, be increased commensurately based on the certification submitted under paragraph (c) of this section. The amount of this increase may not exceed the amount of the Financing Cost Contingency (FCC) authorized but not reserved for the project at the time the proposal is approved. The adjustment must not exceed the amount necessary to reflect an increase in debt service (based on the difference between the projected and actual terms of the permanent financing) resulting from an increase over the projected interest rate of not more than:

(1) One and one-half percent if the projected override was three-fourths of one percent or less, or

(2) One percent if such projected override was more than three-fourths of one percent but not more than one percent, or

(3) One-half of one percent if such projected override was more than one percent.
