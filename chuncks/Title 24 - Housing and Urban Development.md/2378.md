(4) The phrasemeans that in determining whether the fee described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be deemed "nominal", the amount of the fee must be judged in the context of what paid workers doing the same work would earn in the particular locality involved. For example, a "payment" made to a "homeless" volunteer in an amount which covers basic necessities but nonetheless represents an insignificant amount when compared with local cost of living and real wages may be determined to be nominal for purposes of qualifying as a volunteer, provided the payment is not in fact a substitute for compensation and is not tied in any way to productivity.
