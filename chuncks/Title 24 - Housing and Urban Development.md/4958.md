######## Hazard insurance.

(b)No manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan shall be eligible for insurance under this part unless hazard insurance on the manufactured home is obtained by the borrower and the lender is named as a loss payee of insurance benefits. Such insurance shall be maintained by the borrower for the full term of the loan or until the property is repossessed or foreclosed by the lender, and in an amount at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan, except that the amount of insurance coverage shall be not less than the actual cash value of the home where State law precludes a higher amount. If the borrower fails to maintain such insurance, the lender shall obtain it at the borrower's expense. If the home is not insured against hazards and sustains damage which would normally be covered by such insurance during the borrower's ownership, the appraised value of the home for claim purposes will be adjusted in accordance with ยง 201.51(b)(3). Upon acquiring title to the property through repossession or foreclosure, the lender shall maintain hazard insurance upon the property in the amount prescribed above until its disposition and sale.
