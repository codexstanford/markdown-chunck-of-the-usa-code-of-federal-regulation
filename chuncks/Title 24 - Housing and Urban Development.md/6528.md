######## Definition.

(a)Excess Income consists of cash collected as rent from the residents by the mortgagor, on a unit-by-unit basis, that is in excess of the HUD-approved unassisted Basic Rent. The unit-by-unit requirement necessitates that, if a unit has Excess Income, the Excess Income must be returned to HUD. It is not permissible to do an aggregate calculation of the Excess Income for all occupied rent-paying units, and then to offset or subtract from that figure any unpaid rent from occupied or vacant units, before remitting Excess Income to HUD.
