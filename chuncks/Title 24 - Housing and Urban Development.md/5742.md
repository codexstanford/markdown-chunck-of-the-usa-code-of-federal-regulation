(B)For subsequent year property charges, the mortgagee's estimate of withholding amount shall be based on the best information available as to probable payments which will be required to be made for property charges in the coming year. If actual disbursements during the preceding year are used as the basis, the resulting estimate may deviate from those disbursements by as much as ten percent. The mortgagee may not require the withholding of amounts in excess of the current estimated total annual requirement, unless expressly requested by the borrower. Each month's withholding for property charges shall equal one-twelfth of the annual amounts as reasonably estimated by the mortgagee.
