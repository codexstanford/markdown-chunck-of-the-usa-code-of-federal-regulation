####### Methods of purchase.

(c)(1) The homebuyer may achieve ownership when the amount in his EHPA, plus such portion of the NRMR as he wishes to use for the purchase, is equal to the purchase price as shown at that time on his Purchase Price Schedule plus all Incidental Costs (Incidental Costs mean the costs incidental to acquiring ownership, including, but not limited to, the costs for a credit report, field survey, title examination, title insurance, and inspections, the fees for attorneys other than the LHA's attorney, mortgage application and organization, closing and recording, and the transfer taxes and loan discount payment, if any). If for any reason title to the home is not conveyed to the homebuyer during the month in which such circumstances occur, the purchase price shall be fixed at the amount specified for such month and the homebuyer shall be refunded (i) the net additions, if any, credited to his EHPA subsequent to such month, and (ii) such part of the monthly payments made by the homebuyer after the purchase price has been fixed which exceeds the sum of the break-even amount attributable to the unit and the interest portion of the debt service shown in the Purchase Price Schedule.

(2) Where the sum of the purchase price and Incidental Costs is greater than the amounts in the homebuyer's EHPA and NRMR as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the homebuyer may achieve ownership by obtaining financing for or otherwise paying the excess amount. The purchase price shall be the amount shown on his Purchase Price Schedule for the month in which the settlement date for the purchase occurs.

(d) The maximum period for achieving ownership shall be 30 years, but depending upon increases in the homebuyers income and the amount of credit which the homebuyer can accumulate through maintenance and voluntary payments, the period may be shortened accordingly.
