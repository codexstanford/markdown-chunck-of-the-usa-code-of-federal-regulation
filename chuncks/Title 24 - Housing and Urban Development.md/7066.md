######## Related Party.

An entity that, either directly or indirectly, is wholly or partially owned or controlled by the owner of the project being transferred under subpart B of this part, is under whole or partial common control with such owner, or has any financial interest in such owner or in which such owner has any financial interest. However, this shall not prohibit a nonprofit organization from buying out the interest of its limited dividend or for-profit partners in connection with the sale of eligible low income housing under subpart B of this part, as long as the sale is made on an arm's length basis and the partners who sell their interest completely divest themselves of any input in the continued operation of the project. The purchaser and the owner shall not be deemed related parties on the basis that financing is provided to the purchaser by the seller, or a management company affiliated with the seller, as long as:

(1) Only a loan, and not a grant, is provided;

(2) The financing is provided for the acquisition of the project, the rehabilitation of the project, or both;

(3) In the case of financing for the acquisition of the project, the sum of the principal amount of the loan, plus the amount of the acquisition loan under section 241(f) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-6(f)), and any Federal grant to cover acquisition of the project, does not exceed the sum of the sales price and the expenses associated with the acquisition, loan closing and implementation of the plan of action; and in the case of financing for the rehabilitation of the project, the principal amount of the loan does not exceed the equity requirements applicable to the rehabilitation loan or capital improvement loan obtained by the purchaser under part 241 or part 219 of this chapter;

(4) The loan is not a condition of accepting a bona fide offer or entering into a sales contract;

(5) The seller has no input in the continued operation of the project as a result of the loan; and

(6) In the case of a loan provided by a management company that is affiliated with the seller, the execution of a management contract between the purchaser and the management company is not a condition of the loan. This rule does not bar an owner, or former owner, from membership on a nonprofit organization's board of directors, as long as the owner, or former owner, participates only in his or her personal capacity, without compensation, and holds a nonvoting membership. The purchaser and the owner shall not be deemed related parties solely by reason of the purchaser's retention of a property management entity of a company that is owned or controlled by the owner or a principal thereof, if retention of the management company is neither a condition of sale nor part of consideration paid for the project and the property management contract is negotiated by the qualified purchaser on an arm's length basis.
