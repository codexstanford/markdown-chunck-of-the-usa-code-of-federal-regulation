###### Loud impulsive sounds.

(b)On an interim basis, when loud impulsive sounds, such as explosions or sonic booms, are experienced at a site, the day-night average sound level produced by the loud impulsive sounds alone shall have 8 decibels added to it in assessing the acceptability of the site (see appendix I to this subpart). Alternatively, the C-weighted day-night average sound level (L) may be used without the 8 decibel addition, as indicated in ยง 51.106(a)(3). Methods for assessing the contribution of loud impulsive sounds to day-night average sound level at a site and mathematical expressions for determining whether a sound is classed as "loud impulsive" are provided in the appendix I to this subpart.
