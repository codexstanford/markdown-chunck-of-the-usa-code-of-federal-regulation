(a)(1) Anyone, including a purchaser from a transferor of a property pursuant to §§ 291.90(a) and 291.200, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, age, or disability may offer to buy a HUD-owned property, except that:

(i) No member of or delegate to Congress is eligible to buy or benefit from a purchase of a HUD-owned property; and

(ii) No nonoccupant mortgagor (whether an original mortgagor, assumptor, or a person who purchased "subject to") of an insured mortgage who has defaulted, thereby causing HUD to pay an insurance claim on the mortgage, is eligible to repurchase the same property.

(2) Neither HUD nor any transferor pursuant to §§ 291.90(a) or 291.200 will offer former mortgagors in occupancy who have defaulted on the mortgage the right of first refusal to repurchase the same property.

(3) HUD will offer tenants accepted under the occupied conveyance procedures outlined in 24 CFR 203.670 through 203.685 the right of first refusal to purchase the property only if:

(i) The tenant has a recognized ability to acquire financing and a good rent-paying history, and has made a request to HUD to be offered the right of first refusal; or

(ii) State or local law requires that tenants be offered the right of first refusal.
