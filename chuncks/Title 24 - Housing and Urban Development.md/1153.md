## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development
### PART 16 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
#### ยง 16.4 Requests for access; requirements.
##### In person.

(1)Each individual making a request in person shall be required to present satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, in the order of preference and priority, are:

(i) A document bearing the individual's photograph (for example, passport or military or civilian identification card);

(ii) A document bearing the individual's signature (for example, driver's license, social security card, unemployment insurance book, employer's identification card, national credit card and professional, craft or union membership card); and

(iii) A document bearing neither the photograph nor the signature of the individual (for example, a Medicaid card). In the event the individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, the Department will require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3). That penalty provision also appears at ยง 16.13(a). In order to avoid any unwarranted disclosure of an individual's records, the Department reserves the right to determine to its satisfaction whether proof of identity offered by any individual is adequate.
