####### Applicability of other Federal requirements.

(n)The proceeds of the Capital Fund financing are subject to all laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to the use of Capital Fund grants made under 24 CFR part 905, unless otherwise approved by HUD in writing. PHAs undertaking CFFP transactions shall be subject to the following requirements, which shall be further enumerated in a Capital Fund Financing Amendment to the Annual Contributions Contract (CFF ACC Amendment):

(1) Amounts payable to the PHA by HUD pursuant to the CFFP and pledged to the payment of debt service by the PHA shall be used exclusively for debt service in accordance with the debt service schedule approved by HUD and shall not be available for any other purpose;

(2) The financing does not constitute a debt or liability of HUD or the United States, the full faith and credit of the United States are not pledged to the payment of debt service, and debt service is not guaranteed by HUD or the United States;

(3) Nothing in this CFF ACC Amendment or 24 CFR part 905 is intended to diminish HUD's authority to administer, monitor, and regulate the public housing program, including HUD's authority to exercise any administrative sanction or remedy provided by law; provided, however, that except as required by law, HUD will not assert any claim or right under the ACC, including the exercise of administrative sanctions and remedies, if and to the extent that the effect of such claim or right would be to reduce the payment of Capital Fund moneys to the PHA below the level necessary to pay debt service or delay the time for payment of such moneys such that required amounts would not be available to pay debt service when due;

(4) The financing is subject to mandatory prepayment prior to the obligation end date and expenditure end date of the Capital Fund financing proceeds to the extent necessary for the Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds to comply with section 9(j) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(j)). Bond and loan documents shall include appropriate provisions such that prepayment shall be made by the lender, trustee, or appropriate third-party servicer approved by HUD, without any action by HUD post-approval;

(5) HUD agrees, subject to the availability of appropriations, to approve immediately upon receipt from the PHA (subject to any legal requirements or constraints applicable at the time), a CFP Plan document (as described in 24 CFR 905.505(h)) and/or an annual CFF ACC Amendment, to the extent and in an amount sufficient to make the applicable debt service payment;

(6) Prior to cumulatively reducing its inventory of public housing units by more than 5 percent of the Stabilized Base Unit Count, if, after the removal of units from inventory, the Debt Coverage Percentage under ยง 905.505(i)(1) would constitute more than 33 percent of future Capital Funds, the PHA shall prepay the financing such that the reduction in inventory shall not cause the Debt Coverage Percentage to increase. If the reduction in inventory is required by law or public housing requirements, the prepayment is not required to be made prior to the reduction in inventory, but instead shall be made as soon as possible after the PHA becomes aware of the requirement of law or public housing requirements, but only to the extent that Capital Funds are not otherwise needed by the PHA to address the health and safety issues or other requirements of law in the PHA's public housing portfolio, all as determined by HUD. For PHAs that size their loans based upon the projected receipt of RHF funds, prior to undertaking an activity that will reduce its RHF units below the number of units projected in the Capital Fund Financing Proposal as required by ยง 905.505(i)(3), the PHA shall prepay its loan such that debt service does not exceed 100 percent of projected RHF after accounting for the reduction in RHF units, all as determined by HUD.
