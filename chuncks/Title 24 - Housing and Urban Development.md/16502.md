####### Use of ultimate anchor loads to establish the working load design value.

(10)(i) The working load design value is the lowest ultimate anchor load determined by testing, divided by a 1.5 factor of safety.

(ii) The working load design value, for each installation method and soil classification, shall be stated in the ground anchor assembly listing or certification. An anchor tested in a given soil classification number must not be approved for use in a higher/weaker soil classification number. For example an anchor tested in soil classification 3 must not be approved for soil classification 4A or 4B unless it is also tested in those soils. The 500 pound pre-tension is included in the ultimate anchor load.
