####### PHA affiliate.

(4)An affiliate is an entity, other than an instrumentality, formed by a PHA and in which a PHA has a financial or ownership interest or participates in its governance. The PHA has some measure of control over the assets, operations, or management of the affiliate, but such control does not rise to the level of control to qualify the entity as an instrumentality. For the purposes of development, ownership of public housing units by an affiliate would be considered mixed-finance development.
