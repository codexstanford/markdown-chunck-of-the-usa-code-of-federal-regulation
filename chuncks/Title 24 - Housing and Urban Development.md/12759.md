###### ยง 943.130 What are the responsibilities of participating PHAs?
####### Responsibilities, generally.

(a)Despite participation in a consortium, each participating PHA remains responsible for its own obligations under its ACC with HUD. This means that the PHA has an obligation to assure that all program funds, including funds paid to the lead agency for administration by the consortium, are used in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements, and that the PHA program is administered in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements. Any breach of program requirements with respect to a program covered by the consortium agreement is a breach of the ACC with each of the participating PHAs, so each PHA is responsible for the performance of the consortium.
