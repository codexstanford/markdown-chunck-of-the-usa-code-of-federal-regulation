####### Obligation.

(a)A PHA shall obligate each Capital Fund grant, including formula grants, Replacement Housing Factor (RHF) grants, Demolition and Disposition Transitional Funding (DDTF) grants, and natural disaster grants, no later than 24 months after, and emergency grants no later than 12 months after, the date on which the funds become available to the PHA for obligation, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. However, a PHA with unobligated funds from a grant shall disregard this requirement for up to not more than 10 percent of the originally allocated funds from that grant. The funds become available to the PHA when HUD executes the CF ACC Amendment. With HUD approval, and subject to the availability of appropriations, the PHA can accumulate RHF grants for up to 5 years or until it has adequate funds to undertake replacement housing. The PHA shall obligate 90 percent of the RHF grant within 24 months from the date that the PHA accumulates adequate funds, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
