###### § 1003.207 Ineligible activities.

The general rule is that any activity that is not authorized under the provisions of §§ 1003.201 through 1003.206 is ineligible to be assisted with ICDBG funds. This section identifies specific activities that are ineligible and provides guidance in determining the eligibility of other activities frequently associated with housing and community development.

(a) The following activities may not be assisted with ICDBG funds:

(1) Buildings or portions thereof used for the general conduct of government as defined at § 1003.4 cannot be assisted with ICDBG funds. This does not include, however, the removal of architectural barriers under § 1003.201(c) involving any such building. Also, where acquisition of real property includes an existing improvement which is to be used in the provision of a building for the general conduct of government, the portion of the acquisition cost attributable to the land is eligible, provided such acquisition meets the primary objective described in § 1003.208.
