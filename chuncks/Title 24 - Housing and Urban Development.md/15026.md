####### Definition of displaced person.,displaced person

(h)(1) For purposes of this section, the termmeans any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this part. The term "displaced person" includes, but is not limited to:

(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of an application for financial assistance that is later approved.

(ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, that either HUD or the grantee determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.

(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently, after the execution of the agreement between the grantee and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:

(A) The tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or

(B) 30 percent of gross household income.

(iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:

(A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or

(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.

(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:

(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or

(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a "displaced person" (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

(i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application for financial assistance to HUD, but, before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a "displaced person" or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project;

(ii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).

(iii) The grantee determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.

(3) A grantee may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.
