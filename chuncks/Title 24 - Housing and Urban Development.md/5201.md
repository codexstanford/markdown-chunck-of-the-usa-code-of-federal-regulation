(2)(i) A single family mortgage insured under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701), except for mortgages for manufactured housing and mortgages under paragraph (c) of this section, that has an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable mortgage, as of the date the interest rate is set, by more than the combined annual mortgage insurance premium and 1.15 percentage points for a first-lien mortgage is a rebuttable presumption qualified mortgage that is presumed to comply with the ability to repay requirements in 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a).

(ii) To rebut the presumption of compliance, it must be proven that the mortgage exceeded the points and fees limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or that, despite the mortgage having been endorsed for insurance under the National Housing Act, the mortgagee did not make a reasonable and good-faith determination of the mortgagor's repayment ability at the time of consummation, by failing to evaluate the mortgagor's income, credit, and assets in accordance with HUD underwriting requirements.
