####### Payments for vacancies after initial occupancy.

(d)If an eligible family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the owner may receive housing assistance payments for so much of the month in which the Family vacates the unit as the unit remains vacant. Should the unit remain vacant, the Owner may receive from HUD a housing assistance payment in the amount of 80 percent of Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding an additional month. However, if the owner collects any of the family's share of the rent for this period, the payment must be reduced to an amount which, when added to the family's payments, does not exceed 80 percent of the Contract Rent. Any such excess shall be reimbursed by the Owner to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also ยง 886.315.) The owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph unless he or she: (1) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (2) has made and continues to make a good faith effort to fill the vacancy, including but not limited to, contacting applicants on the waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the unit, and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant, except for good cause acceptable to HUD.
