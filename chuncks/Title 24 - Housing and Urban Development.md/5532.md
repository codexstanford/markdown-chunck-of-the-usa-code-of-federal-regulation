(b)(1) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid amount equal to the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value and the mortgagee elects to retain title as provided in § 203.368(g)(2), or if the mortgagee acquires title pursuant to a bid in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value (see § 203.368(g)(4)), the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the amount bid at the sale from the original principal balance of the mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of institution of the foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in § 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in § 203.403; provided however, that appropriate adjustment shall be made for any such items covered by proceeds of the foreclosure sale.

(2) If a party other than the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale not less in amount than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the proceeds of the foreclosure sale distributed to the mortgagee from the original principal balance of the mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of the foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in § 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in § 203.403; provided, however, that appropriate adjustment shall be made for any such items covered by the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.

(3) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid not less in amount than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, and the mortgagor or another party redeems the property, the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the amount paid to redeem the property and received by the mortgagee from the original principal balance of that mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in § 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in § 203.403; provided however, that appropriate adjustments shall be made for any such items covered by that amount paid by the mortgagor or other party to redeem the property.
