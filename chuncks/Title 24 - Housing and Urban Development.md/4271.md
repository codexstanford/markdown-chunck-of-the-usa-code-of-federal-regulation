####### Objections to admissibility.

(b)Except as provided in this paragraph, objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part of a deposition for any reason that would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were present and testifying.

(1) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the basis of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.

(2) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless reasonable objection is made at the taking of the deposition.
