#### Subchapter I - HUD-Owned Properties
##### PART 291 - DISPOSITION OF HUD-ACQUIRED AND -OWNED SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY
###### Subpart D - Sale of HUD-Held Single Family Mortgage Loans
####### ยง 291.302 Purpose and general policy.

This subpart sets forth HUD's policy and procedures for the sale of HUD-held single family mortgage loans. In general, HUD will sell both performing and nonperforming HUD-held single family mortgage loans. HUD will sell all mortgage loans without recourse and without FHA insurance. HUD will package pools of single family mortgage loans for sale to the general public on a competitive basis; however, HUD may sell mortgage loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) on a negotiated basis. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to prevent HUD from packaging single family mortgage loans with other types of HUD assets for sale. The Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying pool of mortgage loans for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered pool of mortgage loans from sale. However, when HUD offers a qualifying mortgage loan for sale, the procedures set out in this subpart and in the bid package will govern the sale of HUD-held single family mortgage loans.
