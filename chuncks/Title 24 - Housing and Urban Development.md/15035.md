####### Factors to be considered for exceptions:

(2)In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the grantee has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HUD shall consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:

(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or essential expert knowledge to the program or project which would otherwise not be available;

(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;

(iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or from the decision-making process, with reference to the specific assisted activity in question;

(iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b) of this section;

(v) Whether undue hardship will result, either to the grantee or to the person affected, when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict;

(vi) Any other relevant considerations.
