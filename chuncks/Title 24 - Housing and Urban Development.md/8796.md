() The percentage of the total costs of the system paid for by CDBG funds does not exceed the percentage of low and moderate income persons in the service area of the system. The unit of general local government must include a description of the boundaries of the service area of the system; the census tracts or enumeration districts within the boundaries; the total number of persons and the total number of low and moderate income persons in each census tract or enumeration district, and the percentage of low and moderate income persons in the service area; and the total cost of the system.

(B) The certifications of the state must be submitted along with a brief statement describing the factual basis upon which the certifications were made.

(iv) Activities meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section may be considered to qualify under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(v) HUD will consider activities meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section to qualify under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, provided that the area covered by the strategy meets one of the following criteria:

(A) The area is in a Federally-designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community;

(B) The area is primarily residential and contains a percentage of low and moderate income residents that is no less than 70 percent;

(C) All of the census tracts (or block numbering areas) in the area have poverty rates of at least 20 percent, at least 90 percent of the census tracts (or block numbering areas) in the area have poverty rates of at least 25 percent, and the area is primarily residential. (If only part of a census tract or block numbering area is included in a strategy area, the poverty rate shall be computed for those block groups (or any part thereof) which are included in the strategy area.)

(D) Upon request by the State, HUD may grant exceptions to the 70 percent low and moderate income or 25 percent poverty minimum thresholds on a case-by-case basis. In no case, however, may a strategy area have both a percentage of low and moderate income residents less than 51 percent and a poverty rate less than 20 percent.
