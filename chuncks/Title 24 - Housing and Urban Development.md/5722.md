####### ยง 206.3 Definitions.
######## Principal limit

means the maximum amount calculated, taking into account the age of the youngest borrower or Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse, the expected average mortgage interest rate, and the maximum claim amount. The principal limit is calculated for the first month that a mortgage could be outstanding using factors provided by the Commissioner. It increases each month thereafter at a rate equal to one-twelfth of the mortgage interest rate in effect at that time, plus one-twelfth of the annual mortgage insurance rate. For an adjustable interest rate HECM, the principal limit increase may be made available to the borrower each month thereafter except that the availability during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period may be restricted. Although the principal limit of a fixed interest rate HECM will continue to increase at the rate provided by the Commissioner, no further funds may be made available for the borrower to draw against after closing. The principal limit may decrease because of insurance or condemnation proceeds applied to the outstanding loan balance under ยง 206.209(b).
