######## Variation procedures.

(ii)Variations from the requirements of any standard with which the Department requires compliance shall be made in the following ways:

(A) For a particular design or construction method to be used on a single case or project, the decision is the responsibility of the Field Office. Headquarters concurrence is not required.

(B) Where a variation is intended to be on a repetitive basis, a recommendation for a Local Acceptable Standard, substantiating data, and background information shall be submitted by the Field Office to the Director, Office of Manufactured Housing and Regulatory Functions.

(iii) Variances which require individual analysis and decision in each instance are not considered as repetitive variances even though one particular standard is repeatedly the subject of variation. Such variances are covered by paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
