######## List price.

(b)The list price, or "asking price," assigned to the property is based upon one or more evaluation tools (e.g., appraisal, Broker Price Opinion, Automated Valuation Model). An appraisal, when used, must be conducted by an independent real estate appraiser who meets all of the requirements of 24 CFR part 200, subpart G, and is in good standing on the appraiser roster established under that section. The appraiser must provide an opinion of the "as-is" market value using a valuation method that is commonly employed in the industry and that is consistent with FHA appraisal requirements.
