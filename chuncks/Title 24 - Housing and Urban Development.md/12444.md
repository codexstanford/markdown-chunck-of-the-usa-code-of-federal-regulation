####### TDC limit.

(c)(1) Public housing funds, including Capital Funds, may not be used to pay for HCC and Community Renewal Costs in excess of the TDC limit, as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, HOPE VI grantees will be eligible to request a TDC exception for public housing and HOPE VI funds awarded in FFY 1996 and prior years. PHAs may also request a TDC exception for integrated utility management, capital planning, and other capital and management activities that promote energy conservation and efficiency. HUD will examine the request for TDC exceptions to ensure that they would be cost-effective, so as to ensure that up-front expenditures subject to the exceptions would be justified by future cost savings.
