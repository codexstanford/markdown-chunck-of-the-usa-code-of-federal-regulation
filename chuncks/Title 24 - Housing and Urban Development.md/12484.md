####### PHAs with 250 or more units in FFY 1999, except the New York City and Chicago Housing Authorities.

(d)The estimates of the existing modernization needs for these PHAs shall be based on the following:

(1) Objective measurable data concerning the following PHA, community, and project characteristics applied to each project:

(i) The average number of bedrooms in the units in a project (Equation coefficient 4604.7);

(ii) The total number of units in a project (Equation coefficient: 10.17);

(iii) The proportion of units in a project in buildings completed in 1978 or earlier. In the case of acquired projects, HUD will use the DOFA unless the PHA provides HUD with the actual date of construction completion. When the PHA provides the actual date of construction completion, HUD will use that date (or, for scattered sites, the average dates of construction of all the buildings), subject to a 50-year cap. (Equation coefficient: 4965.4);

(iv) The cost index of rehabilitating property in the area (Equation coefficient: -10608);

(v) The extent to which the units of a project were in a nonmetropolitan area as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) during FFY 1996 (Equation coefficient: 2703.9);

(vi) The PHA is located in the Southern census region, as defined by the Census Bureau (Equation coefficient: -269.4);

(vii) The PHA is located in the Western census region, as defined by the Census Bureau (Equation coefficient: -1709.5);

(viii) The PHA is located in the Midwest census region as defined by the Census Bureau (Equation coefficient: 246.2); and

(2) An equation constant of 13851.
