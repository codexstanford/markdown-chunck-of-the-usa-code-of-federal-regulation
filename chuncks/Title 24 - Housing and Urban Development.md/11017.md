####### Vacancies after rent-up.

(c)(1) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days; provided, however, That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period in an amount which, when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also ยง 884.115). The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph (c)(1) unless he: (i) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD or the PHA, as the case may be, of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (ii) has taken and continues to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.

(2) If the Owner evicts an Eligible Family, he shall not be entitled to any payment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless the request for such payment is supported by a certification that: (i) He gave such Family a written notice of the proposed eviction, stating the grounds and advising the Family that it had 10 days within which to present its objections to the Owner in writing or in person and (ii) the proposed eviction was not in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law.
