(B) A PHA must make the determination, within one year before expiration of a PBC HAP contract, that renewal of the contract under the PBV program is appropriate to continue providing affordable housing for low-income families.

(C) The renewal of PBC assistance as PBV assistance is effectuated by the execution of a PBV HAP contract addendum as prescribed by HUD and a PBV HAP contract for existing housing.
