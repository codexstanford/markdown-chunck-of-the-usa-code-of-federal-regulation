####### ยง 891.720 Leasing to eligible families.
######## Availability of assisted units for occupancy by eligible families.

(a)During the term of the PAC, a Borrower shall make all units (or residential spaces in a group home) available for eligible families. For purposes of this section, making units or residential spaces available for occupancy by eligible families means that the Borrower:

(1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with ยง 891.740(a);

(2) Has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units or residential spaces to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) Has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the Borrower is temporarily unable to lease all units or residential spaces to eligible families, one or more units or residential spaces may, with the prior approval of HUD, be leased to otherwise eligible families that do not meet the income requirements of part 813 of this chapter, as modified by ยง 891.505. Failure on the part of the Borrower to comply with these requirements is a violation of the PAC and grounds for all available legal remedies, including an action for specific performance of the PAC, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units (or in the case of group homes, reduction of the number of residential spaces) under the PAC as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
