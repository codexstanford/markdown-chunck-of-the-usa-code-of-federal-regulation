###### ยง 5.852 What discretion do I have in screening and eviction actions?
####### Consideration of rehabilitation.

(c)(1) In determining whether to deny admission or terminate tenancy for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, you may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, you may require the applicant or tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.

(2) If rehabilitation is not an element of the eligibility determination (see ยง 5.854(a)(1) for the case where it must be considered), you may choose not to consider whether the person has been rehabilitated.
