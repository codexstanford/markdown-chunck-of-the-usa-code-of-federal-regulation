###### Major systems.,e.g.,

(ii)Major systems are: structural support; roofing; cladding and weatherproofing (windows, doors, siding, gutters); plumbing; electrical; and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. For rental housing, the grantee's standards must require the grantee to estimate (based on age and condition) the remaining useful life of these systems, upon project completion of each major system. For multifamily housing projects of 26 units or more, the grantee's standards must require the grantee to determine the useful life of major systems through a capital needs assessment of the project. For rental housing, if the remaining useful life of one or more major system is less than the applicable period of affordability, the grantee's standards must require the grantee to ensure that a replacement reserve is established and monthly payments are made to the reserve that are adequate to repair or replace the systems as needed. For homeownership housing, the grantee's standards must require, upon project completion, each of the major systems to have a remaining useful life for a minimum of 5 years or for such longer period specified by grantee, or the major systems must be rehabilitated or replaced as part of the rehabilitation work.
