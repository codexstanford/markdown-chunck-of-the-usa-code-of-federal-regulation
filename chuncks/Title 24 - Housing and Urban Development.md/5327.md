(2) Improvements or repairs made under this section must be designed to meet cost-effective energy conservation standards prescribed by the Secretary.

(e) The loan transaction shall be an acceptable risk as determined by the Commissioner.

(f) The loan may not exceed an amount which, when added to any outstanding indebtedness of the borrower that is secured by the property, creates an outstanding indebtedness in excess of the lesser of:

(g) The loan limitation prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section shall not be applicable where a unit of local government demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that:

(1) The property is located within an area which is subject to a community sponsored program of concentrated redevelopment or revitalization, and,

(2) The loan limitation prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, prevents the utilization of the program to accomplish rehabilitation in the subject area, and,

(3) The interests of the mortgagor and the Commissioner are adequately protected.

(h) Insurance may be available for advances made during rehabilitation or upon completion of rehabilitation, according to the procedures in § 203.5, 203.6, or 203.7 (as applicable).

(i) Rehabilitation loans which do not involve the insurance of advances, the refinancing of outstanding indebtedness or the purchase of the property need not be a first lien on the property but shall not be junior to any lien other than a first mortgage. The provisions of §§ 203.15, 203.19, 203.23, 203.24, 203.26, and 203.43j shall not be applicable to such loans.

(2) The mortgagor and the mortgagee shall execute a rehabilitation loan agreement, approved by the Commissioner, setting forth the terms and conditions under which advances will be made.

(3) The advances shall be made as provided in the reliabilitation loan agreement.

(5) The loan shall bear interest at the rate prescribed in § 203.20 on the amount advanced to the mortgagor or its creditors, and the amount held in an account or trust for the benefit of the mortgagor.

(6) If paragraph (k) of this section applies, the rehabilitation loan agreement shall restrict advancement to the mortgagor, or to creditors other than the mortgagee, so that any loan proceeds in excess of the 85 percent set forth in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section shall not be advanced until the property is sold to a purchaser described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.

(k) In the case of a dwelling (1) to be occupied neither as a principal residence nor as a secondary residence and (2) where the loan is approved for a limit higher than the 85 percent set forth in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, the eligible non-occupant mortgagor (as defined in § 203.18(f)(3)) shall certify to the Commissioner that:

(1) The mortgagor will not rent (except for a rental term of not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days), sell (except where the insured mortgage is paid in full as an incident of the sale), or occupy the property before a due date approved by the Commissioner, except with the prior written approval of the Commissioner;

(2) The mortgagor agrees that, if the property is not sold before a due date approved by the Commissioner to a purchaser, acceptable to the Commissioner, who will occupy the property, assume personal liability, and agree to pay the mortgage indebtedness, any amount held in escrow, trust, or special account under paragraph (j) of this section will be applied in reduction of the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage as of the due date approved by the Commissioner;

(3) The mortgagee agrees that any portion of the fund held in escrow, trust, or special account, not applied to the mortgage in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (k), shall be deducted from the amount of the insurance benefits to which the mortgagee would otherwise be entitled if a claim for insurance benefits is filed.
