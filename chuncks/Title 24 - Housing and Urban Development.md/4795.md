######## Warranty.

(d)The manufacturer shall provide, at no cost, a full five-year warranty against defects in material or workmanship, on the absorber plate, cooling passages, and the collector (excluding any glass), running from the date of installation of the solar water heating system. The warranty also shall include the full costs of field inspection, parts, and labor required to remedy the defects, and will include the cost of replacement at the site if required. This warranty is not required to cover defects resulting from exposure to harmful materials, fire, flood, lightning, hurricane, tornado, hailstorms, earthquakes, or other acts of God, vandalism, explosions, harmful chemicals or other fluids, fumes or vapors. This exclusion will apply to the operation of the collector under excessive pressures or excessive flow rates, misuse, abuse, negligence, accidents, alterations, falling objects or other causes beyond the control of the manufacturer. Following the initial five years, the manufacturer shall provide a limited no-cost five-year warranty for collector parts on a prorata allowance basis.
