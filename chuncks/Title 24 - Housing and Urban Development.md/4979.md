######## Partial payments.

(b)The lender shall accept any partial payment (inclusive of late charges) under an executed modification agreement or an acceptable repayment plan, and either apply it to the borrower's account or hold it in a trust account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, they shall be applied to the borrower's account, thus advancing the date of the oldest unpaid installment. If a partial payment is received more than 60 days after the date of default and was not submitted under a repayment plan or a modification agreement, the partial payment may be returned to the borrower, with a letter of explanation.
