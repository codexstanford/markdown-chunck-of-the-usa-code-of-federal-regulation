######### Feasibility letter.

(2)The issuance of a feasibility letter indicates approval of the preliminary work write-up and outline specifications and completion of technical processing involving the estimated rehabilitation cost of the project, the "as is" value of the site, the detailed estimates of operating expenses and taxes, the specific unit rents, the vacancy allowance, and the estimated mortgage amount. The issuance of a feasibility letter is not a commitment to insure a mortgage for the proposed project and does not bind the Commissioner to issue a firm commitment to insure. Determinations found in a feasibility letter are not to be binding upon the Department and may be changed in whole or in part at any later point in time. The letter may even be unilaterally terminated by the Commissioner if found necessary.
