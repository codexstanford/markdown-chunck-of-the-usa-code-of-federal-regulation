() National Electrical Code or

(D) The codes included in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) in connection with the One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code, or

(E) Any combination of the codes included in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), (C), and (D), that is approved by the Secretary, including combinations using the National Standard Plumbing Code published by the National Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors (PHCC), or

(F) Any other building code accepted by the Secretary as a nationally recognized model building code, or

(ii) Any local code or State or local modular building code accepted as generally equivalent to the codes included under paragraph (b)(3)(i), (the Secretary will consider the manufacturer's certification under paragraph (c) of this section to constitute a certification that the code to which the structure is built is generally equivalent to the referenced codes. This certification of equivalency is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section) or

(iii) The minimum property standards adopted by the Secretary pursuant to title II of the National Housing Act; and

(4) To the manufacturer's knowledge, the structure is not intended to be used other than on a site-built permanent foundation.

(c) When a manufacturer makes a certification provided for under paragraph (b) of this section, the certification shall state as follows:

(d) This certification shall be affixed in a permanent manner near the electrical panel, on the inside of a kitchen cabinet door, or in any other readily accessible and visible location.

(e) As part of this certification, the manufacturer shall identify each certified structure by a permanent serial number placed on the structure during the first stage of production. If the manufacturer also manufactures manufactured homes that are certified under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c), the series of serial numbers for structures certified under this section shall be distinguishable on the structures and in the manufacturer's records from the series of serial numbers for the manufactured homes that are certified under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c).

(1) If a manufacturer wishes to certify a structure as a manufactured home under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c) after having applied a serial number identifying it as exempted under this section, the manufacturer may do so only with the written consent of the Production Inspection Primary Inspection Agency (IPIA) after thorough inspection of the structure by the IPIA at at least one stage of production and such removal or equipment, components, or materials as the IPIA may require to perform inspections to assure that the structure conforms to the Federal manufactured home standards. The manufacturer shall remove the original serial number and add the serial number required by § 3280.6.

(2) A manufacturer may not certify a structure under this section after having applied the manufactured home serial number under § 3280.6.

(f) All certifications made under this section are subject to investigation by the Secretary to determine their accuracy. If a certification is false or inaccurate, the certification for purposes of this section is invalid and the structures that have been or may be the subject of the certification are not excluded from the coverage of the Act, the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, or these Regulations.

(1) If the Secretary has information that a certification may be false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice of the nature of this information by certified mail and the procedure of this subparagraph will be followed.

(i) The manufacturer must investigate this matter and report its findings in writing as to the validity of this information to the Secretary within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice.

(ii) If a written report is received within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will review this report before determining whether a certification is false or inaccurate. If a report is not received within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice, the Secretary will make the determination on the basis of the information presented.

(iii) If the Secretary determines that a certification is false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice and the reasons for this determination by certified mail.

(2) The Secretary may seek civil and criminal penalties provided for in section 611 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 5410, if the party in question in the exercise of due care has reason to know that such certification is false or misleading as to any material fact.
