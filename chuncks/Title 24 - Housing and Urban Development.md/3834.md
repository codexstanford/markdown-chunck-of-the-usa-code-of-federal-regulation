(i) Preparing and following a schedule of actions for carrying out the affected activities, consisting of schedules, timetables, and milestones necessary to implement the affected activities;

(ii) Establishing and following a management plan that assigns responsibilities for carrying out the remedial actions;

(iii) Canceling or revising activities likely to be affected by the performance deficiency, before expending HTF funds for the activities;

(iv) Reprogramming HTF funds that have not yet been expended from affected activities to other eligible activities;

(v) Reimbursing its HTF account in any amount not used in accordance with the requirements of this part;

(vi) Suspending disbursement of HTF funds for affected activities; and

(vii) Establishing procedures to ensure compliance with HTF requirements;

(2) HUD may also change the method of payment from an advance to reimbursement basis and may require supporting documentation to be submitted for HUD review for each payment request before payment is made; determine the grantee to be high risk and impose special conditions or restrictions on the allocation in accordance with 2 CFR 200.207 or 200.338; and take other remedies that may be legally available.
