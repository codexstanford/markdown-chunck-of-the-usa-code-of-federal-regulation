######### Amount of payment; assignment of mortgage.

(b)If the mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner, the insurance benefits shall be paid in an amount determined as follows:

(1) By adding to the unpaid principal amount of the mortgage, computed as of the date of default, the following items:

(i) The amount of all payments made by the mortgagee for taxes, special assessments and water rates which are liens prior to the mortgage; for insurance on the property; and for any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default.

(ii) An allowance for reasonable payments made by the mortgagee, with the approval of the Commissioner, for the completion and preservation of the property.

(iii) An amount equivalent to the debenture interest which would have been earned on the portion of the insurance benefits paid in cash, as of the date such cash payment is made, except that when the mortgagee fails to meet any one of the applicable requirements of §§ 207.256 and 207.258 within the specified time and in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner (or within such further time as the Commissioner may approve in writing), the interest allowance in such cash payment shall be computed only to the date on which the particular required action should have been taken or to which it was extended.

(2) By deducting from the total of the items computed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following items:

(i) Any amount received by the mortgagee on account of the mortgage after the date of default.

(ii) Any net income received by the mortgagee from the property covered by the mortgage after the date of default.

(iii) The sum of the cash items retained by the mortgagee pursuant to § 207.258(b)(6), except the balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor.

(iv) An amount equivalent to 1 percent of the mortgage funds advanced to the mortgagor and not repaid as of the date of default, except that all or part of the 1 percent may be waived by the Commissioner if, at his request and in lieu of foreclosure, the mortgage is assigned to the Secretary.

(v) In the case of a lender receiving insurance benefits for the full Mortgage amount upon the Commissioner's endorsement of the Mortgage for full insurance pursuant to 24 CFR parts 251, 252, or 255, the amount of the fee set forth throughnotice. HUD may, in its discretion, collect this fee rather than deducting the fee from the total of the items computed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(vi) Except for multifamily project mortgages for which HUD issued a firm commitment for mortgage insurance before September 1, 2011, and for multifamily project mortgages insured under section 232 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1715w) and under section 242 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-7), when there is a covenant default as defined in § 207.255(a)(1)(ii) and a mortgagee refuses to comply promptly with the Commissioner's request to accelerate payment pursuant to § 207.257, an amount equal to the difference between the project's market value as of the date of the Commissioner's request and the project's market value as of the date the mortgagee makes an election to assign the mortgage, or convey title to the project, as determined by appraisal procedures established by the Commissioner.

(vii) For multifamily project mortgages for which HUD issued a firm commitment for mortgage insurance on or after September 1, 2011, the regulations of paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section shall apply, unless the mortgagor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that financial hardship to the mortgagor would result from application of the regulations in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section due to the reasonable expectations of the mortgagor that the transaction would close under the regulations in effect prior to September 1, 2011, in which case, the regulations of paragraph (b)(2)(vi) shall not apply.
