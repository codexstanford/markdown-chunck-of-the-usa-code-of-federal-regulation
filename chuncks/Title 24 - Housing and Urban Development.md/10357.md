(e)Support services, including the operating and administrative expenses described in section 700.115(a), are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. These actions, however, are not excluded from individual compliance requirements of other environmental statutes, Executive Orders, and agency regulations where appropriate. When the responsible official determines that any action under this part may have an environmental effect because of extraordinary circumstances, the requirements of NEPA shall apply.
