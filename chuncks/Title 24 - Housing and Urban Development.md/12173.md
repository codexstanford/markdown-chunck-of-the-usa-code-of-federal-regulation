####### Monthly operating expense rate.

b.The monthly operating expense rate for each fiscal year shall be established on the basis of the Authority's HUD-approved operating budget for that fiscal year. The operating budget may be revised during the course of the fiscal year in accordance with HUD requirements. If it is subsequently determined that the actual operating expense for a fiscal year was more or less than the amount provided by the monthly operating expense established for that fiscal year, the rate of monthly operating expense to be established for the next fiscal year may be adjusted to account for the difference (see section 12). Such adjustment may result in a change in the required monthly payment (see section 7c).
