(a) A mortgagee holding a mortgage insured pursuant to a conditional or firm commitment issued on or before November 30, 1983 has the option to assign, transfer and deliver to the Commissioner the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing it, provided the mortgage is not in default at the expiration of 20 years from the date of final endorsement of the credit instrument.
