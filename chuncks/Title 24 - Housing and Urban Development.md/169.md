The term applies whether or not the employee is denoted as an officer of the Department. "Employee" is to be construed broadly to include persons who are retained on a contractual or consultative basis under an Office of Human Resources appointment. However, "employee" does not include an independent contractor, e.g., a firm or individual working under the authority of a procurement contract.
