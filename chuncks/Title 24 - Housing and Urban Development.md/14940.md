####### Job creation or retention activities.

(d)An activity designed to create or retain permanent jobs where at least 51 percent of the jobs, computed on a full time equivalent basis, involve the employment of low and moderate persons. For purposes of determining whether a job is held by or made available to a low or moderate income person, the person may be presumed to be a low or moderate income person if: he/she resides within a census tract (or block numbering area) where not less than 70 percent of the residents have incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median; or, if he/she resides in a census tract (or block numbering area) which meets the Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community eligibility criteria; or, if the assisted business is located in and the job under consideration is to be located in such a tract or area. As a general rule, each assisted business shall be considered to be a separate activity for purposes of determining whether the activity qualifies under this paragraph. However, in certain cases such as where ICDBG funds are used to acquire, develop or improve a real property (e.g., a business incubator or an industrial park) the requirement may be met by measuring jobs in the aggregate for all the businesses which locate on the property, provided such businesses are not otherwise assisted by ICDBG funds. Where ICDBG funds are used to pay for the staff and overhead costs of a CBDO under the provisions of ยง 1003.204 making loans to businesses from non-ICDBG funds, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created by all of the businesses receiving loans during any one year period. For an activity that creates jobs, the grantee must document that at least 51 percent of the jobs will be held by, or will be available to, low and moderate income persons. For an activity that retains jobs, the grantee must document that the jobs would actually be lost without the ICDBG assistance and that either or both of the following conditions apply with respect to at least 51 percent of the jobs at the time the ICDBG assistance is provided: The job is known to be held by a low or moderate income person; or the job can reasonably be expected to turn over within the following two years and that steps will be taken to ensure that it will be filled by, or made available to, a low or moderate income person upon turnover. Jobs will be considered to be available to low and moderate income persons for these purposes only if:

(1) Special skills that can only be acquired with substantial training or work experience or education beyond high school are not a prerequisite to fill such jobs, or the business agrees to hire unqualified persons and provide training; and

(2) The grantee and the assisted business take actions to ensure that low and moderate income persons receive first consideration for filling such jobs.
