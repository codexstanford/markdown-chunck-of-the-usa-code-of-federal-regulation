####### Determination of HCC limit.

(2)HUD will determine the HCC limit as listed in at least two nationally recognized residential construction cost indices for publicly bid construction of a good and sound quality for specific bedroom sizes and structure types. The two indices HUD will use for this purpose are the R.S. Means cost index for construction of "average" quality and the Marshal & Swift cost index for construction of "good" quality. HUD has the discretion to change the cost indices to other such indices that reflect comparable housing construction quality through a notice published in theThe resulting construction cost guideline is then multiplied by the number of public housing units in the project, based upon bedroom size and structure type. The HCC limit for a project is calculated by adding the resulting amounts for all public housing units in the project.

(3) The HCC limit is not applicable to the acquisition of existing housing, whether or not such housing will be rehabilitated. The TDC limit is applicable to such acquisition.
