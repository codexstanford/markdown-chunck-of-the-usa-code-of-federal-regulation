######## Termination of housing assistance.

(i)The recipient may terminate assistance to a participant who violates program requirements. Recipients should terminate assistance only in the most severe cases. Recipients may resume assistance to a participant whose assistance was previously terminated. In terminating assistance to a participant, the recipient must provide a formal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance to due process of law. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:

(1) Written notice to the participant containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;

(2) A review of the decision, in which the participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision; and

(3) Prompt written notice of the final decision to the participant.
