######## Factors to be considered for exceptions.

(ii)In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the threshold requirements under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, HUD must conclude that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the ESG program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's or subrecipient's program or project, taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:

(A) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project that would otherwise not be available;

(B) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;

(C) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions, responsibilities or the decision-making process with respect to the specific activity in question;

(D) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in the position described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

(E) Whether undue hardship results to the recipient, the subrecipient, or the person affected, when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and

(F) Any other relevant considerations.
