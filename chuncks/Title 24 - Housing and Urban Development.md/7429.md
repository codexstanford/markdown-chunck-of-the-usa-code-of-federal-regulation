(f)The mortgage must contain a covenant prohibiting the use of the property for any purpose other than the purpose intended on the day the mortgage was executed. The conversion of a project from rental to cooperative is not a "change in use" as that term is employed in the mortgage since the property will continue to have a residential use both before and after conversion.
