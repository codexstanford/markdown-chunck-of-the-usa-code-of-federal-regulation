The termincludes, but may not be limited to:

(i) A person who moves permanently from the real property after receiving notice requiring such move, if the move occurs on or after the date the owner submits to the HA the owner proposal that is later approved;

(ii) A person, including a person who moves from the property before the date the owner submits the proposal to the HA, if the HA or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or

(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the execution of the Agreement between the owner and the HA (or, for projects assisted under subpart H of this part, after the "initiation of negotiations" (see paragraph (h) of this section)), if the move occurs before the tenant is provided a written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon its completion. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:

(A) The tenant's monthly rent before the execution of the agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or

(B) Thirty percent of gross household income.

(C) For projects assisted under subpart H of this part, the amount cannot exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent before the "initiation of negotiations" and estimated average monthly utility costs; or (if the tenant is low-income) the total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 5.613, or (if the tenant is not low-income) 30 percent of gross household income; or

(iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling, who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:

(A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or

(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or

(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the building/complex, if either:

(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or

(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a displaced person (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or other good cause, and the HA determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;

(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the preliminary proposal (or application, if there is no preliminary proposal), and before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project and its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a displaced person (or for any assistance provided under this section) as a result of the project;

(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or

(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.

(3) The HA may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.
