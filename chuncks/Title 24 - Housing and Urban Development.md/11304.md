####### Secondary sources.

(ii)Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of "elderly families") from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of "elderly families" which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.
