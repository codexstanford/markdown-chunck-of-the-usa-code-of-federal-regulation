######## ยง 206.25 Calculation of disbursements.
######### Line of credit separately or with monthly disbursements.

(g)If the borrower has a line of credit, separately or combined with the term or tenure payment option, the principal limit is divided into an amount set aside for servicing charges under ยง 206.19(f)(3), an amount equal to the line of credit (including any portion of the principal limit set aside for repairs or property charges under ยง 206.19(f)(1) or (2)), and the remaining amount of the principal limit (if any). The line of credit amount increases at the same rate as the total principal limit increases under ยง 206.3. The sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period shall not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If a requested disbursement would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit, the mortgagee may make a partial disbursement to the borrower for the amount that will not exceed the limit. Upon the conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request subsequent disbursements up to the available principal limit.
