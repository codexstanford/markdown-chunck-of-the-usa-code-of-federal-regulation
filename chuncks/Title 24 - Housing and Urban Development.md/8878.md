######## Remedies.

(b)(1) If HUD finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing that a State or unit of general local government has failed to comply with any provision of this subpart, until HUD is satisfied that there is no longer failure to comply, HUD shall:

(i) Terminate payments to the state;

(ii) Reduce payments for current or future grants to the state by an amount equal to the amount of CDBG funds distributed or used without compliance with the requirements of this subpart;

(iii) Limit the availability of payments to the state to activities not affected by the failure to comply or to activities designed to overcome the failure to comply;

(iv) Based on the state's failure to comply with a requirement of this subpart (other than the state's current failure to comply which will affect the use of the succeeding year grant), condition the use of the grant funds upon appropriate corrective action by the state specified by HUD; or

(v) With respect to a CDBG grant awarded by the state to a unit of general local government, withhold, reduce, or withdraw the grant, require the state to withhold, reduce, or withdraw the grant, or take other action as appropriate, except that CDBG funds expended on eligible activities shall not be recaptured or deducted from future CDBG grants to such unit of general local government.

(2) HUD may on due notice suspend payments at any time after the issuance of a notice of opportunity for hearing pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, pending such hearing and a final decision, to the extent HUD determines such action necessary to prevent a continuation of the noncompliance.

(c) In lieu of, or in addition to, the action authorized by paragraph (b) of this section, if HUD has reason to believe that the state or unit of general local government has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this subpart, HUD may:

(1) Refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted; and

(2) Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the CDBG funds which was not expended in accordance with this subpart, or for mandatory or injunctive relief.
