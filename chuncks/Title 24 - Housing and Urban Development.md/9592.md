(A) Whether the applicant submitted the request to the appropriate political jurisdiction; and

(B) The reasonableness of the jurisdiction's refusal to provide the certificate.

(ii) If the jurisdiction did not provide written reasons for refusal, including the reasons why the project is not consistent with the jurisdiction's Consolidated Plan in its initial response to the applicant's request for a certification, HUD will find for the applicant without further inquiry or response from the political jurisdiction.
