####### Continuation of project rental assistance payment.

(3)(i) A household shall remain eligible for project rental assistance payment until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a pro rata share of the gross rent in a group home). The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the household's other rights under its lease. Project rental assistance payment may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent or other relevant circumstances during the term of the PRAC, the household meets the income eligibility requirements of 24 CFR part 813 (as modified in ยง 891.105) and project rental assistance is available for the unit or residential space under the terms of the PRAC. The household will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

(ii) A household's eligibility for project rental assistance payment may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including information related to disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B).
