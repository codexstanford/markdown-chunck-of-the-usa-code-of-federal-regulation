######## Special conditions.

(d)(1) For the purposes of this section, a Qualified Tenant whose initial lease was effective before May 1, 1983 includes the following: A Qualified Tenant that resided in a unit assisted under the Rental Assistance Programs or Rent Supplement Program on April 30, 1983, and whose assistance under those programs has been continuous thereafter; and a family that resided in a unit with the benefit of section 8 Housing Assistance Payments on July 31, 1982 and whose participation in the section 8, Rent Supplement or the Rental Assistance Payment Program has been continuous thereafter. A Qualified Tenant or family shall not be disqualified if, after that date, it moved from one unit to another unit in the same project. For these purposes, units in buildings located on adjacent sites and managed as one project will be considered part of the same project even if they have separate project numbers and separate mortgages.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Total Tenant Payment payable by a Qualified Tenant who continues to receive assistance in the same project shall not be increased by more than 10 percent during any 12-month period as a result of application of the percentages in paragraph (c) of this section, and application of the revised definitions in §§ 236.2 and 236.3. However, this 10 percent limit does not apply to Families subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, provided that the welfare agency includes as the housing component of the Family's grant an amount equal to their entire rent payment, without reduction. The Total Tenant Payment may be increased by more than 10 percent during any 12-month period to the extent that the portion of such increase above 10 percent is attributable to increases in income or changes in family composition or family circumstances that are unrelated to the factors set out in this paragraph (d)(2).
