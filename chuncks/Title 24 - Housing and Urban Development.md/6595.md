####### ยง 236.760 Change in tenant income status.

Appropriate adjustments will be made in rental assistance payments to reflect changes in income or other circumstances which are reported by a tenant and verified or are shown by the annual tenant income recertification, as required by ยง 236.80. Rental assistance payments will be discontinued when it is determined by the Secretary that the amount the tenant is required to pay for rent, in accordance with ยง 236.735, is sufficient to pay the approved basic monthly rental (plus, where applicable, the established utility allowance) for the unit occupied by the tenant. Where a tenant is no longer entitled to rental assistance payments, he/she may continue to occupy the unit. The rents charged for the unit shall not exceed those specified in subpart A.
