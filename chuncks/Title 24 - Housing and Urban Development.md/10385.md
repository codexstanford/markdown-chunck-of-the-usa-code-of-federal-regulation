####### Needs qualification for funding.

(3)An eligible applicant that does not qualify to receive PHDEP funding under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be in one of the following needs categories to qualify for funding:

(i) The eligible applicant must be in the top 50% of the unit-weighted distribution of an index of a rolling average rate of violent crimes of the community, as computed for each Federal Fiscal Year (FFY). The crime rate used in this needs determination formula is the rate, from the most recent years feasible, of FBI violent crimes per 10,000 residents of the community (or communities). If this information is not available for a particular applicant's community, HUD will use the average of data from recipients of a comparable State and size category of PHA (less than 500 units, 500 to 1249 units, and more than 1250 units). If fewer than five PHAs have data for a given size category within a State, then the average of PHAs for a given size category within the census region will be used; or

(ii) The eligible applicant must have qualified for PHDEP funding, by receiving an application score of 70 or more points under any one of the PHDEP NOFAs for FFY 1996, FFY 1997 or FFY 1998, but not have received an award because of the unavailability of funds.
