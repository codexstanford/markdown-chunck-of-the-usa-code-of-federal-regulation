####### Procedure to request preliminary natural disaster grant for immediate preservation.

(d)A PHA may request a preliminary grant only for costs necessary for immediate preservation of the property and safety of the residents. The application should include the reasonable identification of damage and preservation costs as determined by the PHA. An independent assessment will be required when the PHA submits the final request or when the PHA reconciles the preliminary application grant with the actual amounts received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), insurance carriers, and other natural disaster relief sources. Regardless of whether further funding from the set-aside is requested, at a time specified by HUD, the PHA will be expected to provide a reconciliation of all funds received, to ensure that the PHA does not receive duplicate funding.
