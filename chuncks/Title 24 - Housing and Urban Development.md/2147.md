###### Acceptable Separation Distance From a Potential Fire Hazard.

(3)This is the actual setback required for the safety of occupied buildings and their inhabitants, and people in open spaces (exposed areas) from a potential fire hazard. The specific distance required for safety from such a hazard depends upon the nature and the volume of the substance. The Technical Guidebook entitled "Urban Development Siting With Respect to Hazardous/Commercial Industrial Facilities," which supplements this regulation, contains the technical guidance required to compute Acceptable Separation Distances (ASD) for those flammable substances most often encountered.
