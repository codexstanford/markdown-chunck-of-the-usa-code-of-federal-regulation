######## Unit assignment.

(d)If the Borrower determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the Borrower will assign the family a unit. The Borrower will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD's general occupancy guidelines. If no suitable unit is available, the Borrower will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted within the next 12 months, the Borrower may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason, except that the Borrower may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for assistance and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.
