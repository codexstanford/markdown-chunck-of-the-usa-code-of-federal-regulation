###### § 1003.206 Program administration costs.

ICDBG funds may be used for the payment of reasonable administrative costs and carrying charges related to the planning and execution of community development activities assisted in whole or in part with funds provided under this part. No more than 20 percent of the sum of any grant plus program income received shall be expended for activities described in this section and in § 1003.205-Eligible planning, urban environmental design and policy-planning-management capacity building activities. This does not include staff and overhead costs directly related to carrying out activities eligible under §§ 1003.201 through 1003.204, since those costs are eligible as part of such activities. In addition, technical assistance costs associated with developing the capacity to undertake a specific funded activity are also not considered program administration costs. These costs must not, however, exceed 10% of the total grant award.
