####### ยง 206.306 Removal from the HECM Counselor Roster.
######## Placement on the Roster after removal.

(f)A counselor who has been removed from the Roster must apply for reinstatement on the Roster (in accordance with ยง 206.304) after the period of the counselor's removal from the Roster has expired. FHA may require the counselor to retake and pass the HECM exam for reinstatement when the reason for removal from the Roster was particularly egregious. Typically, the counselor will not be required to take and pass the HECM exam; however, FHA must be ensured by the counselor that the HECM counseling requirements are understood and will be followed. An application from a counselor for reinstatement on the Roster will be rejected if the period of the counselor's removal from the Roster has not expired.
