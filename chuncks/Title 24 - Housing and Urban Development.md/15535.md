###### § 3280.305 Structural design requirements.
####### Design live loads.

(2)The design live loads and wind and snow loads shall be as specified in this section and shall be considered to be uniformly distributed. The roof live load or snow load shall not be considered as acting simultaneously with the wind load and the roof live or snow load and floor live loads shall not be considered as resisting the overturning moment due to wind.

(3) When engineering calculations are performed, allowable unit stresses may be increased as provided in the documents referenced in § 3280.304 except as otherwise indicated in §§ 3280.304(b)(1) and 3280.306(a).

(4) Whenever the roof slope does not exceed 20 degrees, the design horizontal wind loads required by § 3280.305(c)(1) may be determined without including the vertical roof projection of the manufactured home. However, regardless of the roof slope of the manufactured home, the vertical roof projection shall be included when determining the wind loading for split level or clerestory-type roof systems.
