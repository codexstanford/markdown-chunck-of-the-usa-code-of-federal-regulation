(a)-(1)(i) The State is responsible for the administration of all CDBG funds. The State may use CDBG funds not to exceed $100,000, plus 50 percent of administrative expenses incurred in excess of $100,000. Amounts of CDBG funds used to pay administrative expenses in excess of $100,000 shall not, subject to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, exceed the sum of 3 percent of the State's annual grant; 3 percent of program income received by units of general local government during each program year, regardless of the origin year in which the State grant funds that generate the program income were appropriated (whether retained by units of general local government or paid to the State); and 3 percent of funds reallocated by HUD to the State.

(ii) To pay the costs of providing technical assistance to local governments and nonprofit program recipients, a State may, subject to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, use CDBG funds received on or after January 23, 2004, in an amount not to exceed the sum of 3 percent of its annual grant; 3 percent of program income received by units of general local government during each program year, regardless of the origin year in which the State grant funds that generate the program income were appropriated (whether retained by units of general local government or paid to the State); and 3 percent of funds reallocated by HUD to the State during each program year.

(iii) The amount of CDBG funds used to pay the sum of administrative costs in excess of $100,000 paid pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and technical assistance costs paid pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section must not exceed the sum of 3 percent of the State's annual grant; 3 percent of program income received by units of general local government during each program year, regardless of the origin year in which the State grant funds that generate the program income were appropriated (whether retained by the unit of general local government or paid to the State); and 3 percent of funds reallocated by HUD to the State.

(iv) In calculating the amount of CDBG funds that may be used to pay State administrative expenses prior to January 23, 2004, the State may include in the calculation the following elements only to the extent that they are within the following time limitations:

(A) $100,000 per annual grant beginning with FY 1984 allocations;

(B) Two percent of the sum of a State's annual grant and funds reallocated by HUD to the State within a program year, without limitation based on when such amounts were received;

(C) Two percent of program income returned by units of general local government to States after August 21, 1985; and

(D) Two percent of program income received and retained by units of general local government after February 11, 1991.

(v) In regard to its administrative costs, for grants before origin year 2015, the State has the option of selecting its approach for demonstrating compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For grants beginning with origin year 2015 grants and subsequent grants, the State must use the approach in paragraph (a)(1)(v)(A) of this section. Any State whose matching cost contributions toward State administrative expense matching requirements are in arrears must bring matching cost contributions up to the level of CDBG funds expended for such costs. A State grant may not be closed out if the State's matching cost contribution is not at least equal to the amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 expended for administration. The two approaches for demonstrating compliance with this paragraph (a)(1) are:
