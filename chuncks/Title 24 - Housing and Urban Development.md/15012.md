(B)If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or

(iii) Develop, subject to Area ONAP one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference.

(2) If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then the grantee shall:

(i) Re-advertise the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or

(ii) Re-advertise the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or

(iii) If one approvable bid or proposal is received, request Area ONAP review and approval of the proposed contract and related procurement documents, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.320, in order to award the contract to the single bidder or offeror.

(3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 2 CFR 200.320 need not follow the formal bid or proposal procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small purchase procedures of2 CFR 200.320. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.

(4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding or proposal solicitation documents and the bidding and proposal documents.

Grantees may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal, or at the time of submission:

(i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership and interest;

(ii) Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest; and

(iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.

(6) The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded in connection with a project funded under this part:

(i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent feasible:

(A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and

(B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.

(ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.

(iii) In connection with this contract, the contractor shall, to the greatest extent feasible, give preference in the award of any subcontracts to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and preferences and opportunities for training and employment to Indians.

(iv) The contractor shall include this Section 7(b) clause in every subcontract in connection with the project, and shall, at the direction of the grantee, take appropriate action pursuant to the subcontract upon a finding by the grantee or HUD that the subcontractor has violated the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act.
