######## Cash equity.

(d)Depending on the financial circumstances of each hospital facility, HUD shall have the discretion to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the amount of equity that a mortgagor must supply in addition to the value of plant, property, and equipment and other values recognized as loan security in the commitment process. Exercise of this discretion shall never cause a loan to exceed 90 percent of estimated replacement cost, although it may cause it to be less than 90 percent. The equity contribution may not be made from borrowed funds. A private nonprofit or public mortgagor, but not a proprietary mortgagor, at the mortgagee's option and subject to 24 CFR 242.49, may provide any such required equity in the form of a letter of credit.
