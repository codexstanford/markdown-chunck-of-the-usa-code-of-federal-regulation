####### Low-income family

means a family whose income does not exceed 80 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that HUD may, for purposes of this paragraph, establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 percent of the median for the area on the basis of the findings of HUD or the agency that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs or unusually high or low family incomes.
