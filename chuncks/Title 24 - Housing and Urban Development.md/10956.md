##### Subpart C - Definitions and Other Requirements
###### ยง 883.308 Adjustments to reflect changes in terms of financing.
####### Recoupment of savings in financing costs.

(f)In the event that interim financing is continued after the first year of the term of the Contract and the debt service of the interim financing for any period of three months after such first year is less than the anticipated debt service under the permanent financing on which the Contract Rents were based, an appropriate amount reflecting the savings in financing cost will be credited by HUD to the Project Account and withheld from housing assistance payments payable to the owner. If during the course of the same year there is any period of three months in which the debt service is greater than the anticipated debt service under the projected permanent financing, an adjustment will be made so that only the net amount of savings in debt service for the year is credited by HUD to the Project Account and withheld from housing assistance payments to the owner. No increased payments will be made to the owner on account of any net excess for the year of actual interim debt service over the anticipated debt service under the permanent financing. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed as requiring a permanent reduction in the Contract Rents or precluding adjustments of Contract Rents in accordance with paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section.
