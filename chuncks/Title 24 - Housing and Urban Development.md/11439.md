####### Project rental assistance payment

means the payment made by HUD to the Owner for assisted units as provided in the PRAC. The payment is the difference between the total tenant payment and the HUD-approved per unit operating expenses except for expenses related to items not eligible under design and cost provisions. An additional payment is made to a household occupying an assisted unit when the utility allowance is greater than the total tenant payment. A project rental assistance payment, known as a "vacancy payment," may be made to the Owner when an assisted unit is vacant, in accordance with the terms of the PRAC.
