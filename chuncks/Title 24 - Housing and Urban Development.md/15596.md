(vii)The truss design is acceptable if all of the following conditions are met:

(A) The maximum deflection between no load and dead load must be L/480 or less for simply supported clear spans and Lo/180 or less for eave and cornice projections; and

(B) Dead load to design live load deflections shall be L/180 or less for simply supported clear spans and Lo/90 or less for eave and cornice projections; and

(C) After the design live load is removed and with the dead load still applied, the maximum recovery deflection must be L/360 or less for simply supported spans and Lo/180 or less for eave and cornice projections; and

(D) The truss shall maintain the overload condition for 5 minutes without rupture, fracture, or excessive yielding; and

(E) After 2.5 times the design live load is removed, and with the dead load still applied, the truss must recover to at least L/180 for simply supported clear spans and Lo/90 for eave and cornice within 4 hours after the total live load has been removed; and

(F) As applicable, each truss design must also meet all requirements for uplift loads in Wind Zone I or Wind Zone II and III, as required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
