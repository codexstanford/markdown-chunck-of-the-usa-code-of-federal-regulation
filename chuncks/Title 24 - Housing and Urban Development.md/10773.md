####### Special Adjustments.

(2)(i) A special adjustment, to the extent determined by HUD to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the unit which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates and utilities not covered by regulated rates, may be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD. Subject to appropriations, a special adjustment may also be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD when HUD determines that a project is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent, and not specific to a particular project, and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity. HUD may, on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the current gross rents for each unit size under a Housing Assistance Payments Contract, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs and reserves required for the Owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to HUD for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Prior to approval of a special adjustment to cover the cost of physical improvements, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4.

(ii) The aforementioned special rent adjustments will only be approved if and to the extent the Owner clearly demonstrates that these general increases have caused increases in the owners operating costs which are not adequately compensated for by annual adjustments.

(iii) The Owner must submit financial information to the PHA which clearly supports the increase. For Contracts of more than twenty units, the Owner must submit audited financial information.
