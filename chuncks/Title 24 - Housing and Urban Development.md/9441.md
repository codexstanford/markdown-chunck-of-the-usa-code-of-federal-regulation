######## Relocation assistance for displaced persons.,In general.,et seq.

(c)(1)A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with, the URA and 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601). Whenever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to comparable and suitable decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require providing a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. (See 49 CFR 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D).) As required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) and 49 CFR part 24, replacement dwellings must also contain the accessibility features needed by displaced persons with disabilities.
