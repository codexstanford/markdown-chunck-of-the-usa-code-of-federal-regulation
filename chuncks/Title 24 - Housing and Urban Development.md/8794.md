() At least 51 percent of the use of the system will be by low and moderate income persons. The state's certification may be based upon information which identifies the total number of calls actually received over the preceding twelve-month period for each of the emergency services to be covered by the emergency telephone number system and relates those calls to the geographic segment (expressed as nearly as possible in terms of census tracts, enumeration districts, block groups, or combinations thereof that are contained within the segment) of the service area from which the calls were generated. In analyzing this data to meet the requirements of this section, the state will assume that the distribution of income among callers generally reflects the income characteristics of the general population residing in the same geographic area where the callers reside. Alternatively, the state's certification may be based upon other data, agreed to by HUD and the state, which shows that over the preceding twelve-month period the users of all the services to be included in the emergency telephone number system consisted of at least 51 percent low and moderate income persons.
