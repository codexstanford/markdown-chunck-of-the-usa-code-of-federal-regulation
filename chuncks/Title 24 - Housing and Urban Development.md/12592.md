####### Mixed-finance procurement.

(h)The requirements of 2 CFR part 200 and 24 CFR 905.316 are applicable to this subpart with the following exceptions:

(1) PHAs may select a development partner using competitive proposals procedures for qualifications-based procurement, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation and compliance with TDC and other applicable cost limitations;

(2) An Owner Entity (which, as a private entity, would normally not be subject to 2 CFR part 200) shall be required to comply with 2 CFR part 200 if HUD determines that the PHA or PHA instrumentality, or either of their members or employees, exercises significant decision making functions within the Owner Entity with respect to managing the development of the proposed units. HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt such an Owner Entity from the need to comply with 2 CFR part 200 if it determines that the Owner Entity has developed an acceptable alternative procurement plan.
