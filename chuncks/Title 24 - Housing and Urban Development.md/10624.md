###### ยง 880.603 Selection and admission of assisted tenants.
####### Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.

(b)The owner is responsible for obtaining and verifying information related to income eligibility in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F, and evidence related to citizenship and eligible immigration status in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart E, to determine whether the applicant is eligible for assistance in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 5, and to select families for admission to the program, which includes giving selection preferences in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.

(1) If the owner determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the owner will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD standards. If no suitable unit is available, the owner will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the owner may advise the applicant that no additional applications are being accepted for that reason, provided the owner complies with the procedures for informing applicants about admission preferences as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.

(2) If the owner determines that an applicant is ineligible on the basis of income or family composition, or because of failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers (as provided by 24 CFR part 5), or because of failure by an applicant to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided by 24 CFR parts 5 and 813), or that the owner is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the owner will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination and its reasons, and that the applicant has the right to meet with the owner or managing agent in accordance with HUD requirements. Where the owner is a PHA, the applicant may request an informal hearing. If the PHA determines that the applicant is not eligible, the PHA will notify the applicant and inform the applicant that he or she has the right to request HUD review of the PHA's determination. The applicant may also exercise other rights if the applicant believes that he or she is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin. See 24 CFR part 5 for the informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal preference or the failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status and for notice requirements where assistance is terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced based on wage and claim information obtained by HUD from a State Wage Information Collection Agency.

(3) Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be maintained and retained for three years.
