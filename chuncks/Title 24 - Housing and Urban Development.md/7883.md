######## Multiple bids.

(i)Real estate brokers may submit unlimited numbers of bids on an individual property provided each bid is from a different prospective purchaser. If a purchaser submits multiple bids on the same property, only the bid producing the highest net return to HUD will be considered. If a prospective owner-occupant purchaser submits a bid on more than one property, the bid that produces the greatest net return to HUD will be accepted and all other bids from that purchaser will be eliminated from consideration. However, if the prospective owner-occupant purchaser has submitted the only acceptable bid on another property, then that bid must be accepted and all other bids from that purchaser on any other properties will be eliminated from consideration.
