##### ยง 971.13 HUD enforcement authority.

Section 202 provides HUD authority to ensure that certain distressed developments are properly identified and removed from PHA inventories. Specifically, HUD may:

(a) Direct a PHA to cease additional spending in connection with a development which meets or is likely to meet the statutory criteria, except as necessary to ensure decent, safe and sanitary housing until an appropriate course of action is approved;

(b) Identify developments which fall within the statutory criteria where a PHA has failed to do so properly;

(c) Take appropriate actions to ensure the removal of developments from the inventory where the PHA has failed to adequately develop or implement a plan to do so; and

(d) Authorize or direct the transfer of capital funds committed to or on behalf of the development (including comprehensive improvement assistance, comprehensive grant amounts attributable to the development's share of funds under the formula, and major reconstruction of obsolete projects funds) to tenant-based assistance or appropriate site revitalization for the agency.
