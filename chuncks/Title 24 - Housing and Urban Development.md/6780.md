######## Preliminary Review Letter

means a letter from HUD to a potential applicant communicating the result of the Preliminary Review. The letter may state that an application for mortgage insurance would probably not be successful and provide the reasons for this determination, or state that no factors that would cause an application to be rejected have been identified, and therefore there appears to be no bar to the applicant proceeding to a preapplication meeting.
