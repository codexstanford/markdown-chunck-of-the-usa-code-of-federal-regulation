(1) The project does not require an Environmental Impact Statement under provisions of ยง 51.104(b)(1) and noise is the only environmental issue.

(2) The project has received a Special Environmental Clearance and has received the concurrence of the Environmental Clearance Officer.

(3) The project meets other program goals to provide housing in proximity to employment, public facilities and transportation.

(4) The project is in conformance with local goals and maintains the character of the neighborhood.

(5) The project sponsor has set forth reasons, acceptable to HUD, as to why the noise attenuation measures that would normally be required for new construction in the L65 to L70 zone cannot be met.
