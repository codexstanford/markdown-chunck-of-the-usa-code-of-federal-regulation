######### TOTAL

(t)is an acronym that stands for "Technology Open to Approved Lenders." TOTAL is a mortgage scorecard based on a mathematical equation that is to be used within an automated underwriting system (AUS). TOTAL is a tool to assist the mortgagee in managing its workflow and expediting the endorsement process, and is not a substitute for the mortgagee's reasonable consideration of risk and credit worthiness. Direct Endorsement mortgagees using TOTAL remain solely responsible for the underwriting decision.
