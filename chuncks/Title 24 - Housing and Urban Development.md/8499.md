######## Notifications of the opportunity to be excluded.

(g)Any county seeking to qualify for an entitlement grant as an urban county for any Federal fiscal year shall notify each unit of general local government which is located, in whole or in part, within the county and which would otherwise be included in the urban county, but which is eligible to elect to have its population excluded from that of the urban county, that it has the opportunity to make such an election, and that such an election, or the failure to make such an election, shall be effective for the period for which the county qualifies as an urban county. These notifications shall be made by a date specified by HUD. A unit of general local government which elects to be excluded from participation as a part of the urban county shall notify the county and HUD in writing by a date specified by HUD. Such a unit of government may subsequently elect to participate in the urban county for the remaining one or two year period by notifying HUD and the county, in writing, of such election by a date specified by HUD.
