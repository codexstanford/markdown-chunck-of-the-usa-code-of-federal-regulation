###### ยง 882.514 Family participation.
####### Continued participation of Family when Contract is terminated.

(e)If an Owner evicts an assisted family in violation of the Contract or otherwise breaches the Contract, and the Contract for the unit is terminated, and if the Family was not at fault and is eligible for continued assistance, the Family may continue to receive housing assistance through the conversion of the Moderate Rehabilitation assistance to tenant-based assistance under the Section 8 certificate or voucher program. The Family must then be issued a certificate or voucher, and treated as any participant in the tenant-based programs under 24 CFR part 982, and must be assisted by the PHA in finding a suitable unit. All requirements of 24 CFR part 982 will be applicable except that the term of any housing assistance payments contract may not extend beyond the term of the initial Moderate Rehabilitation Contract. If the Family is determined ineligible for continued assistance, the certificate or voucher may be offered to the next Family on the PHA's waiting list. The unit will remain under the Moderate Rehabilitation ACC which provides for such a conversion of the units; therefore no amendment to the ACC will be necessary to convert to the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs.
