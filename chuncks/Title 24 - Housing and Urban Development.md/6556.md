(a) In a case where the mortgage is in default, the mortgagor and the mortgagee may enter into a forbearance agreement for the reduction or suspension of the mortgagor's regular mortgage payments for a specified period of time, if the Commissioner determines that the default was due to circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control and that the mortgage probably will be restored to good standing within a reasonable period of time. Such determination shall be evidenced by the Commissioner's written approval of the forbearance agreement.

(b) The time specified in ยง 207.258(a) of this chapter, within which a mortgagee shall give the Commissioner written notice of its intention to file an insurance claim, shall be suspended for the period of time specified in the forbearance agreement as long as the mortgagor complies with the requirements of such agreement.

(c) If the mortgagor fails to meet the requirements of a forbearance agreement or to cure the default under the mortgage at the expiration of the forbearance period, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days, the mortgagee shall notify the Commissioner of such failure. Within 45 days thereafter, unless a modification or extension of the forbearance agreement has been approved by the Commissioner, the mortgagee shall notify the Commissioner of its election to file an insurance claim and of its election to either assign the mortgage to the Commissioner or acquire and convey title to the property to the Commissioner. If the mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner, the special insurance benefits prescribed in ยง 236.265(b) shall be applicable.
