######## Income payments.

(4)The general rule is that CDBG funds may not be used for income payments. For purposes of the CDBG program, "income payments" means a series of subsistence-type grant payments made to an individual or family for items such as food, clothing, housing (rent or mortgage), or utilities, but excludes emergency grant payments made over a period of up to three consecutive months to the provider of such items or services on behalf of an individual or family.
