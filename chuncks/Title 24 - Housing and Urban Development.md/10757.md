####### Project account.

(b)(1) A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project. The account will contain the sum of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out for the project under the ACC each year. Payments will be made from this account when needed to cover increases in Contract Rents or decreases in Gross Family Contributions for (i) housing assistance (including vacancy) payments, (ii) the amount of the fee for PHA costs of administration, and (iii) other costs specifically approved by the Secretary.

(2) When a HUD-approved estimate of required payments under the ACC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment, and would cause the amount in the project account to be less than 40 percent of the maximum, HUD will, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the ACC will be adequate to cover increases in Contract Rents and decreases in Gross Family Contributions.
