####### Continuation of housing assistance payments.

(c)A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments will continue until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Contact Rent plus any applicable Utility Allowance. The termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see part 5, subpart E, of this title for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
