######## Continuation of project assistance payment.

(3)(i) A family occupying an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) shall remain eligible for project assistance payment until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a pro rata share of the gross rent in a group home). The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Project assistance payment may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the PAC, the family meets the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter (as modified in ยง 891.505) and project assistance is available for the unit or residential space under the terms of the PAC. The family will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

(ii) A family's eligibility for project assistance payment may also be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.
