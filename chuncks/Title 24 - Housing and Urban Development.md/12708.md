(i)Any other information that may reasonably be required for HUD review of the program. Except for the PHA-HUD implementing agreement under ยง 906.49 and the deed restriction required by ยง 906.39(n), HUD approval is not required for documents to be prepared and used by the PHA in implementing the program (such as contracts, applications, deeds, mortgages, promissory notes, and cooperative or condominium documents), if their essential terms and conditions are described in the program. Consequently, those documents need not be submitted as part of the program or the supporting documentation.
