###### displaced person

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as aif:

(A) The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the participating jurisdiction determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance. The effective date of any termination or refusal to renew must be preceded by at least 30 days advance written notice to the tenant specifying the grounds for the action.

(B) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application but, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, incur a rent increase), and the fact that the person would not qualify as a "displaced person" (or for any assistance under this section) as a result of the project;

(C) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or

(D) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.

(iii) The jurisdiction may, at any time, ask HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this rule.
