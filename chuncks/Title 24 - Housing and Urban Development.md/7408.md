######## General.

(a)HUD will agree to insure periodic advances of mortgage proceeds or to insure the entire mortgage upon completion of construction for projects involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation. Existing projects without the need for substantial rehabilitation will be considered insurance upon completion cases. In insurance upon completion cases, only the permanent loan is insured and a single endorsement is required after satisfactory completion of construction, substantial rehabilitation or repairs. In periodic advances cases, progress payments approved by the HFA and both an initial and final endorsement on the mortgage are required.
