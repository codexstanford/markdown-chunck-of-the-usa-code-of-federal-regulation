####### Pets temporarily on the premises.

(h)The pet rules may exclude from the project pets not owned by a tenant that are to be kept temporarily on the project premises. For the purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, pets are to be kept "temporarily" if they are to be kept in the tenant's dwelling accommodations for a period of less than 14 consecutive days and nights. HUD, however, encourages project owners and PHAs to permit the use of a visiting pet program sponsored by a humane society, or other nonprofit organization.
