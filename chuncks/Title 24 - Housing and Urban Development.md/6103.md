(1) Complete the search and either obtain the necessary hardware or software, or sign service contracts;

(2) Complete their data loading; and

(3) Begin electronic transmission by May 20, 1994. These project owners are required to transmit data collected for the 12 months preceding May 20, 1994, as well as data collected on or after this date. Data collected for the 12 months preceding May 20, 1994, is to include only the tenant's most recent "complete certification" (move-in, initial certification, interim recertification, or annual recertification).
