#### PART 880 - SECTION 8 HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS PROGRAM FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION
##### Subpart E - Housing Assistance Payments Contract
###### ยง 880.503 Maximum annual commitment and project account.
####### Project Account.

(b)(1) A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project. The account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the Contract or ACC each year. Payments will be made from this account for housing assistance payments (and fees for PHA administration, if appropriate) when needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant rents and for other cost specifically approved by the Secretary.

(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required annual payments under the Contract or ACC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment and would cause the amount in the project account to be less than 40 percent of the maximum, HUD will, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the Contract or ACC will be adequate to cover increases in Contract rents and decreases in tenant rents.
