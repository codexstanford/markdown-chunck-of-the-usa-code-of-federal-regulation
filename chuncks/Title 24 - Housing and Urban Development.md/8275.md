(a)(1)(i) The owner of an eligible project who has requested a Restructuring Plan and contract renewal must provide a 12-month notice as provided in section 514(d) if MAHRA, if the owner later decides not to renew an expiring contract (except due to a rejection under §§ 401.101, 401.403, 401.405, or 401.451.) If the owner gives such 12-month notice, the owner is not required to give a separate notice under section 8(c)(8) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.

(2) The owner of an eligible project who has requested a Restructuring Plan but who has been rejected under §§ 401.101, 401.403, 401.405, or 401.451 must provide 12 months advance notice under section 8(c)(8)(A) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, unless project-based assistance is renewed under § 402.4 of this chapter.

(3) Notices required by this paragraph must be provided to tenants and to HUD or the contract administrator. HUD will prescribe the form of notices under this paragraph, to the extent that the form is not prescribed by section 8(c)(8) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.
