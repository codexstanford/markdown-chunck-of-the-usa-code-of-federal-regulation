####### § 570.483 Criteria for national objectives.
######## Additional criteria.

(e)(1) In any case where the activity undertaken is a public improvement and the activity is clearly designed to serve a primarily residential area, the activity must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section whether or not the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section are met in order to qualify as benefiting low and moderate income persons.

(2) Where the assisted activity is acquisition of real property, a preliminary determination of whether the activity addresses a national objective may be based on the planned use of the property after acquisition. A final determination shall be based on the actual use of the property, excluding any short-term, temporary use. Where the acquisition is for the purpose of clearance which will eliminate specific conditions of blight or physical decay, the clearance activity shall be considered the actual use of the property. However, any subsequent use or disposition of the cleared property shall be treated as a "change of use" under § 570.489(j).

(3) Where the assisted activity is relocation assistance that the unit of general local government is required to provide, the relocation assistance shall be considered to address the same national objective as is addressed by the displacing activity. Where the relocation assistance is voluntary, the unit of general local government may qualify the assistance either on the basis of the national objective addressed by the displacing activity or, if the relocation assistance is to low and moderate income persons, on the basis of the national objective of benefiting low and moderate income persons.

(4) Where CDBG-assisted activities are carried out by a Community Development Financial Institution whose charter limits its investment area to a primarily residential area consisting of at least 51 percent low- and moderate-income persons, the unit of general local government may also elect the following options:

(i) Activities carried out by the Community Development Financial Institution for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs may, at the option of the unit of general local government, be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph under the criteria at paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section in lieu of the criteria at paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

(ii) All housing activities for which the Community Development Financial Institution obligates CDBG assistance during any one-year period may be considered to be a single structure for purposes of applying the criteria at paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(5) If the unit of general local government has elected to prepare a community revitalization strategy pursuant to the authority of § 91.315(e)(2) of this title, and the State has approved the strategy, the unit of general local government may also elect the following options:

(i) Activities undertaken pursuant to the strategy for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs may, at the option of the grantee, be considered to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section under the criteria at § 570.483(b)(1)(v) instead of the criteria at § 570.483(b)(4); and

(ii) All housing activities in the area undertaken pursuant to the strategy may be considered to be a single structure for purposes of applying the criteria at paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(6) If an activity meeting the criteria in § 570.482(f)(3)(v) also meets the requirements of either paragraph (e)(4)(i) or (e)(5)(i) of this section, the unit of general local government may elect to qualify the activity either under the area benefit criteria at paragraph (b)(1)(iv) or (v) of this section or under the job aggregation criteria at paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(D) of this section, but not under both. Where an activity may meet the job aggregation criteria at both paragraphs (b)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of this section, the unit of general local government may elect to qualify the activity under either criterion, but not both.
