###### ยง 904.104 Eligibility and selection of homebuyers.
####### Determination of eligibility and preparation of list.

(c)The LHA, without participation of a recommending committee (see paragraph (e)(1) of this section), must determine the eligibility of each applicant family in respect to the income limits for the development (including the requirement that the applicant family disclose and verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 750, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 760), and must then assign each eligible applicant its appropriate place on a waiting list for the development, in sequence based upon the date of the application, suitable type or size of unit, qualification for a Federal preference in accordance with ยง 904.122, and factors affecting preference or priority established by the LHA's regulations. Notwithstanding the fact that the LHA may not be accepting additional applications because of the length of the waiting list, the LHA may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for participation and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in ยง 904.122(c)(2), unless the LHA determines, on the basis of the number of applicants who are already on the waiting list and who claim a Federal preference, and the anticipated number of admissions to housing under Turnkey III, that-

(1) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a Federal preference, and

(2) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the LHA's system for applying the Federal preferences, the preference or preferences that the applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants on the waiting list, the applicant would qualify for admission before other applicants on the waiting list.
