However, notwithstanding § 982.638(d), the PHA may, in its discretion, permit a family that has defaulted on its mortgage to move to a new unit with continued voucher homeownership assistance if the PHA determines that the default is due to catastrophic medical reasons or due to the impact of a federally declared major disaster or emergency. The requirements of §§ 982.627(a)(5) and 982.627(e) do not apply to such a family.
