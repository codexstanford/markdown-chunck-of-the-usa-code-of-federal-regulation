####### Review of the record.

(c)After timely submission of evidence by the debtor, the OHA will review the evidence submitted by the Department that shows that all or part of the debt is past due and legally enforceable. The decision of an administrative judge of the OHA will be based on a preponderance of the evidence as to whether there is a debt that is past due and whether it is legally enforceable. The administrative judge of the OHA shall make a determination based upon a review of the evidence that comprises the written record, except that the OHA may order an oral hearing if the administrative judge of the OHA finds that:

(1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Department to consider a waiver of the indebtedness and the waiver determination turns on credibility or veracity; or

(2) The question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence.
