######## Utilities.

(ii)Utility services shall be independent for each living unit, except that common services such as water, sewer, gas and electricity may be provided for living units under a single mortgage or ownership. Separate utility service shut-off for each unit shall be provided. For living units under separate ownership, common utility services may be provided from the main to the building line when protected by an easement or covenant and maintenance agreement acceptable to HUD, but shall not pass over, under or through any other living unit. Individual utilities serving a living unit may not pass over, under or through another living unit under the same mortgage unless provision is made for repair and maintenance of utilities without trespass or when protected by an easement or covenant providing permanent access for maintenance and repair of the utilities. Building drain cleanouts shall be accessible from the exterior where a single drain line within the building serves more than one unit.
