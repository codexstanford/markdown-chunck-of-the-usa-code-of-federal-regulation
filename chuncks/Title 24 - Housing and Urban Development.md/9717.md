######## Temporary relocation.,Existing Building Not Assisted under Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Act.

(b)(1)No tenant may be required to relocate temporarily for a project if the building in which the project is being undertaken or will be undertaken is not currently assisted under Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Act. The absence of such assistance to the building means the tenants are not homeless and the tenants are therefore not eligible to receive assistance under the Continuum of Care program. When a tenant moves for such a project under conditions that cause the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA), 42 U.S.C. 4601-4655, to apply, the tenant must be treated as permanently displaced and offered relocation assistance and payments consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.
