####### Operating and maintenance expenses.

(2)The general rule is that any expense associated with repairing, operating or maintaining public facilities, improvements and services is ineligible. Specific exceptions to this general rule are operating and maintenance expenses associated with public service activities, interim assistance, and office space for program staff employed in carrying out the ICDBG program. For example, the use of ICDBG funds to pay the allocable costs of operating and maintaining a facility used in providing a public service would be eligible under ยง 1003.201(e), even if no other costs of providing such a service are assisted with such funds. Examples of ineligible operating and maintenance expenses are:

(i) Maintenance and repair of streets, parks, playgrounds, water and sewer facilities, neighborhood facilities, senior centers, centers for persons with a disability, parking and similar public facilities; and

(ii) Payment of salaries for staff, utility costs and similar expenses necessary for the operation of public works and facilities.
