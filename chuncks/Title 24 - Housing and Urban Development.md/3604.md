(b)Before committing funds to a project, the grantee must evaluate the project in accordance with guidelines that it has adopted for determining a reasonable level of profit or return on recipient's investment in a project and must not invest any more HTF funds, alone or in combination with other governmental assistance, than is necessary to provide quality affordable housing that is financially viable for a reasonable period (at minimum, the period of affordability in ยง 93.302 or ยง 93.304) and that will not provide a profit or return on the recipient's investment that exceeds the grantee's established standards for the size, type, and complexity of the project. The guidelines adopted by the grantees must require the grantee to undertake:

(1) An examination of the sources and uses of funds for the project (including any operating cost assistance, operating cost assistance reserve, or project-based rental assistance that will be provided to the project) and a determination that the costs are reasonable; and

(2) An assessment, at minimum, of the current market demand in the neighborhood in which the project will be located, the experience of the recipient, the financial capacity of the recipient, and firm written financial commitments for the project.

(3) For HTF-funded downpayment assistance, a market analysis is not required.
