## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development
### PART 93 - HOUSING TRUST FUND
#### Subpart G - Project Requirements
##### ยง 93.304 Qualification as affordable housing: Homeownership.
###### Special considerations for single family properties with more than one unit.

(g)(1) If the HTF funds are used only to assist an income-eligible homebuyer in acquiring one unit in a single family property containing more than one unit and the assisted unit will be the principal residence of the homebuyer, the affordability requirements of this section apply only to the assisted unit.

(2) If HTF funds are also used to assist the income-eligible homebuyer in acquiring one or more of the rental units in the single family property, the affordability requirements of ยง 93.302 apply to assisted rental units, except that the grantee must impose resale restrictions on all assisted units (owner-occupied and rental units) in the single-family housing. The affordability requirements on all assisted units continue for the period of affordability. If HTF funds are used to assist only the rental units in such a property, then the requirements of ยง 93.302 would apply and the owner-occupied unit would not be subject to the income targeting or affordability provisions of this section.
