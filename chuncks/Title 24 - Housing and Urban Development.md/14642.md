####### Davis-Bacon wage rates.

(a)(1) As described in section 104(b) of NAHASDA, contracts and agreements for assistance, sale, or lease under NAHASDA must require prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147) to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the development of affordable housing.

(2) When NAHASDA assistance is only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single family housing, the Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that NAHASDA assistance will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing.

(3) Prime contracts not in excess of $2000 are exempt from Davis-Bacon wage rates.
