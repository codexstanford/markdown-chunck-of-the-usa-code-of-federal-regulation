(A) The person moved into the property after the submission of the housing plan to HUD, but before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a "displaced person" or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project;

(B) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or

(C) The DHHL determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.

(iii) The DHHL may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.
