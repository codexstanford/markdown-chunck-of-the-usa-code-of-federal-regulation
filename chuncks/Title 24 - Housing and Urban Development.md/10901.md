####### Certifications and HUD monitoring.

(c)(1) Generally, when reviewing any of the certifications of an HFA required by this part, HUD shall accept the certification as correct. If HUD has substantial reason to question the correctness of any element in a certification, HUD shall promptly bring the matter to the attention of the HFA and ask it to provide documentation supporting the certifications. When the HFA provides such evidence, HUD will act in accordance with the HFA's judgment or evaluation unless HUD determines that the certification is clearly not supported by the documentation.

(2) HUD will periodically monitor the activities of HFA's participating under this part only with respect to Section 8 or other HUD programs. This monitoring is intended primarily to ensure that certifications submitted and projects operated under this part reflect appropriate compliance with Federal law and requirements.
