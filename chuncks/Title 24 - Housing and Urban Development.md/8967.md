######## displaced person

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the term "-" does not include:

(A) A person who is evicted for cause based upon serious or repeated violations of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement. To exclude a person on this basis, the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) must determine that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance under this section;

(B) A person who moves into the property after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, but who received a written notice of the expected displacement before occupancy.

(C) A person who is not displaced as described in 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).

(D) A person who the grantee (or State, as applicable) determines is not displaced as a direct result of the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted activity. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.

(iii) A grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) may, at any time, request HUD to determine whether a person is a displaced person under this section.
