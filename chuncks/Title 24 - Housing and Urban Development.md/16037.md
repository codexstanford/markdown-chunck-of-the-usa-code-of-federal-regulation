() Dynamic loading factor, (0.25)[(b2iA) + (b2iB)].

(B) However, the in-transit design loading need not exceed twice the dead load of the manufactured home.

(ii) To determine the adequacy of individual longitudinal structural components to resist the in-transit design loading, a load distribution based on the relative flexural rigidity and shear stiffness of each component may be utilized. For the purpose of loading distribution, the sidewall may be considered to be acting as a "deep beam" in conjunction with other load carrying elements in determining the relative stiffness of the integrated structure. Further, by proper pre-cambering of the chassis assembly, additional loading may be distributed to the chassis, and the remaining loading may be distributed to each of the load carrying members by the relative stiffness principle.

(iii) The analysis is also to include consideration for:

(A) Location of openings in the sidewall during transport and, when appropriate,

provisions for reinforcement of the structure and/or chassis at the opening.
