####### Owner selection of individuals.

(2)The owner must rent all vacant units under contract to homeless individuals located through HA or owner outreach efforts and determined by the HA to be eligible. The owner is responsible for tenant selection and may refuse any individual, provided the owner does not unlawfully discriminate. If the owner rejects an individual, and the individual believes that the owner's rejection was the result of unlawful discrimination, the individual may request the assistance of the HA in resolving the issue and may also file a complaint with HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity in accordance with 24 CFR 103.25. If the individual requests the assistance of the HA, and if the HA cannot resolve the complaint promptly, the HA should advise the individual that he or she may file a complaint with HUD, and provide the individual with the address of the nearest HUD Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
