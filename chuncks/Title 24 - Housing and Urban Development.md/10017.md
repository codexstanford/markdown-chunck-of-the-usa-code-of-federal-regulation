######## Use.

(a)HUD will grant funds to recipients to pay a portion of the cost of new construction, including cost-effective energy measures and the cost of land associated with that construction, for use in the provision of supportive housing. If the grant funds are used for new construction, the applicant must demonstrate that the costs associated with new construction are substantially less than the costs associated with rehabilitation or that there is a lack of available appropriate units that could be rehabilitated at a cost less than new construction. For purposes of this cost comparison, costs associated with rehabilitation or new construction may include the cost of real property acquisition.
