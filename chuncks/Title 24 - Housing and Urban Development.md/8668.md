(2)The maximum amount that can be provided to a student is $13,200 a year, including $1,000 for an administrative allowance, subject to the 20% limitation described at 570.416(c)(4) below. HUD will not set maximums on how much should be spent to each eligible expenditure, other than for administrative costs. The institution must be able to document that the amounts paid are customary for that institution and that it has actually paid that amount to the students. If a student is receiving a Pell grant, he/she may not receive funding for the same educational support through HSI-WSP. However, HSI-WSP can substitute for all or part of the Pell grant.
