###### Exceptions.

(2)Upon written request of a recipient, the grantee (or subgrantee, if authorized by the grantee) may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HTF program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's HTF-assisted project. In determining whether to grant a requested exception, the grantee shall consider the following factors:

(i) Whether the person receiving the benefit is a member of a group or class of low-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted housing, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;

(ii) Whether the person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted housing in question;

(iii) Whether the tenant protection requirements of ยง 93.303 are being observed;

(iv) Whether the affirmative marketing requirements of ยง 93.350 are being observed and followed; and

(v) Any other factor relevant to the grantee's determination, including the timing of the requested exception.
