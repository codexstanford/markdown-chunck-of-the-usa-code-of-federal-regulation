####### Sufficient

(3)(i)does not require that in every locality there be an equal number of assisted units within and outside of areas of minority concentration. Rather, application of this standard should produce a reasonable distribution of assisted units each year which over a period of several years will approach an appropriate balance of housing opportunities within and outside areas of minority concentration. An appropriate balance in any jurisdiction must be determined in light of local conditions affecting the range of housing choices available for very low-income minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or low-income minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), and in relation to the racial mix of the locality's population.
