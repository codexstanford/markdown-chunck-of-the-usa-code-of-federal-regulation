####### Switch from flat rent to income-based rent because of hardship.

(g)(1) A family that is paying a flat rent may at any time request a switch to payment of income-based rent (before the next annual option to select the type of rent) if the family is unable to pay flat rent because of financial hardship. The PHA must adopt written policies for determining when payment of flat rent is a financial hardship for the family.

(2) If the PHA determines that the family is unable to pay the flat rent because of financial hardship, the PHA must immediately allow the requested switch to income-based rent. The PHA shall make the determination within a reasonable time after the family request.

(3) The PHA policies for determining when payment of flat rent is a financial hardship must provide that financial hardship include the following situations:

(i) The family has experienced a decrease in income because of changed circumstances, including loss or reduction of employment, death in the family, or reduction in or loss of earnings or other assistance;

(ii) The family has experienced an increase in expenses, because of changed circumstances, for medical costs, child care, transportation, education, or similar items; and

(iii) Such other situations determined by the PHA to be appropriate.
