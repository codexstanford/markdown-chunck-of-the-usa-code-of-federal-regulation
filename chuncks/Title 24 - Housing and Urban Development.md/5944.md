######## § 206.129 Payment of claim.
######### Amount of payment-assigned mortgages.

(e)This paragraph describes the amount of payment if the mortgagee assigns a mortgage to the Commissioner under § 206.107(a)(1) or § 206.121(b).

(1) When a mortgagee assigns a mortgage which is eligible for assignment under § 206.107(a)(1), the amount of payment shall be computed by subtracting from the outstanding loan balance on the date of assignment all cash retained by the mortgagee, including amounts held or deposited for the account of the borrower or to which it is entitled under the mortgage transaction that have not been applied in reduction of the principal mortgage indebtedness, and any adjustments for damage or neglect to the property pursuant to §§ 206.140, 206.141 and 206.142.

(2) The claim shall also include:

(i) Reimbursement for such costs and attorney's fees as the Commissioner finds were properly incurred in connection with the assignment of the mortgage to the Commissioner; and

(ii) An amount equivalent to the interest allowance which will have been earned from the date the mortgage was assigned to the Commissioner to the date the claim is paid, if the claim had been paid in debentures, except that if the mortgagee fails to meet any of the requirements of § 206.127(c), or § 206.131 if applicable, within the specified time and in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner (or within such further time as the Commissioner may approve in writing), the interest allowance in the payment of the claim shall be computed only to the date on which the particular required action should have been taken or to which it was extended. The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3)(x)(A)-(G) of this section pertaining to debentures are applicable except that the issue date of the debentures shall be the date the mortgage was assigned to the Commissioner.

(3) When a mortgagee assigns a mortgage under § 206.121(b) after demand by the Commissioner, the mortgagee will not receive the entire claim payment as contained in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. The amount of the claim shall be computed by totaling the payments made by the mortgagee to the borrower or for the benefit of the borrower, and subtracting from the total the cash retained by the mortgagee, including amounts held or deposited for the account of the borrower or to which it is entitled under the mortgage transaction that have not been applied in reduction of the principal mortgage indebtedness, and any adjustments for damage or neglect to the property pursuant to §§ 206.141 and 206.142. The claim shall also be reduced by an amount determined by the Commissioner to reimburse the Commissioner for administrative expenses incurred in assuming the mortgagee's responsibility under the mortgage, which may include expenses for staff time. If more than one mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner, the administrative expenses incurred for all the mortgages assigned shall be allocated among the mortgages as determined by the Commissioner. The claim shall not include accrued interest whether or not it has been included in the loan balance.
