######## Financial feasibility.

(4)The approval process entails a determination of the financial feasibility of the proposal, i.e., a determination that it is probable that the proposed mortgagor will be able to meet its debt service requirements during the period projected. It includes analysis of the reimbursement structure of the proposed hospital (including patient/payer mix); actions of competitors; and the probable projected impact on the proposed hospital of general health care system trends, such as the development of alternative health care delivery systems and new reimbursement methods. In addition to historical operating margin, determination of financial feasibility includes, but is not limited to, evaluation of the following factors, which the application must address and which HUD will review:

(i) Current and projected gains from operations and a manageable debt load using reasonable assumptions;

(ii) Current debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 or higher and projected debt service coverage ratio of 1.40 or higher;

(iii) Cushion in the balance sheet sufficient to demonstrate the ability to withstand short periods of net operating losses without jeopardizing financial viability;

(iv) Patient utilization forecasts (including average length of stay, case intensity, discharges, area-wide use rates) that are consistent with the hospital's historical trends, future service mix, market trends, population forecasts, and business climate;

(v) The hospital's demonstrated ability to position itself to compete in its marketplace;

(vi) Organizational affiliations or relationships that help optimize financial, clinical, and operational performance;

(vii) Management's demonstrated ability to operate effectively and efficiently, and to develop effective strategies for addressing problem areas;

(viii) Systems in place to monitor hospital operations, revenues, and costs accurately and in a timely manner;

(ix) A Board that is appropriately constituted and provides effective oversight;

(x) Required licensures and approvals; and

(xi) Favorable ratings from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or other organizations acceptable to HUD.
