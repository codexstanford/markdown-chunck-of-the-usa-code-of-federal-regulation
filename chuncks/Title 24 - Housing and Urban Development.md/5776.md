######## § 206.25 Calculation of disbursements.
######### Monthly disbursements-tenure option.

(f)(1) Monthly disbursements under the tenure payment option shall be calculated as if the number of months in the payment term equals 100 minus the lesser of the age of the youngest borrower or 95, multiplied by 12, but payments shall continue until the mortgage becomes due and payable under § 206.27(c), except that in the event that payments would exceed any maximum mortgage amount stated in the security instrument or would otherwise exceed the amount secured by the first lien, in accordance with § 206.19(h) payments will cease immediately; payments may be reinstated only in the event a new Note and mortgage are executed in accordance with § 206.27(b)(10); and in the event of a deferral of due and payable status in accordance with § 206.27(c)(3) payments will cease immediately upon the death of the borrower.

(2) Mortgagees shall ensure that tenure monthly disbursements made to the borrower during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period do not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If the sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit for that time period, the mortgagee shall decrease the monthly disbursements during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period to conform with the maximum Initial Disbursement Limit; upon conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request a payment plan recalculation.

(3) If the borrower makes a partial prepayment of the outstanding loan balance during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the mortgagee shall apply the funds from the partial prepayment in accordance with the Note.

(4) If the mortgagee receives repayment from insurance or condemnation proceeds after restoration or repair of the damaged property, the available principal limit and outstanding loan balance shall be reduced by the amount of such payments.
