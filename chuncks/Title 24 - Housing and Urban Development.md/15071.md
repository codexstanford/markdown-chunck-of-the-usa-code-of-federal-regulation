###### Assumption or sale of leasehold.

(2)The lease form must contain a provision requiring tribal consent before any assumption of an existing lease, except where title to the leasehold interest is obtained by the Department through foreclosure of the guaranteed mortgage or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. A mortgagee other than the Department must obtain tribal consent before obtaining title through a foreclosure sale. Tribal consent must be obtained on any subsequent transfer from the purchaser, including the Department, at foreclosure sale. The lease may not be terminated by the lessor without HUD's approval while the mortgage is guaranteed or held by the Department.

(3) The mortgagee or HUD shall only pursue liquidation after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the Indian tribe, or the Indian housing authority servicing the Indian tribe or the TDHE servicing the Indian tribe. The mortgagee or HUD shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except to one of these three entities.
