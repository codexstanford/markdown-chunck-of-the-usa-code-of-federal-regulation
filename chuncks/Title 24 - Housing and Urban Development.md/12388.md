####### Emergencies and natural disasters.

(b)An emergency is an unforeseen or unpreventable event or occurrence that poses an immediate threat to the health and safety of the residents that must be corrected within one year of funding. A natural disaster for purposes of the Capital Fund reserve, is a non-presidentially declared disaster. In the event an emergency or natural disaster arises, HUD may require a PHA to use any other source that may legally be available, including unobligated Capital Funds, prior to providing emergency or natural disaster funds from the set-aside. The Department will review, on a case-by-case basis, requests for emergency and natural disaster funding from PHAs.
