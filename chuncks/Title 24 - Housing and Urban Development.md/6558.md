(a) [Reserved]

(b) When the mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner pursuant to § 236.260 or is assigned in a case where the mortgagor fails to comply with the requirements of a forbearance agreement approved by the Commissioner in accordance with the requirements of § 236.255 or is assigned in a case where the mortgagor fails to cure the default at the expiration of the forbearance period, the insurance benefits shall be paid in cash and shall be computed in accordance with § 207.259(b) of this chapter, except that in lieu of the allowance for debenture interest in § 207.259(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, the payment shall include the amount of the unpaid accrued mortgage interest computed to the date the assignment of the mortgage to the Commissioner is filed for record. In addition, an amount shall be included equivalent to the debenture interest which would have been earned from the date the mortgage assignment was filed for record to the date the cash payment is made, except that when the mortgagee fails to meet any one of the applicable requirements of §§ 207.256, 207.258(b), and 236.255(c) of this chapter within the specified time and in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner (or within such further time as the Commissioner may approve in writing), such amount shall be computed only to the date on which the particular required action should have been taken or to which it was extended.
