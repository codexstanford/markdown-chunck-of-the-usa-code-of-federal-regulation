######### Mortgagee late charge.

(j)The mortgagee shall pay a late charge to the borrower for any late disbursement. If the mortgagee does not mail or electronically transfer a scheduled monthly disbursement to the borrower on the first business day of the month or make a line of credit disbursement within 5 business days of the date the mortgagee received the request, the late charge shall be 10 percent of the entire amount that should have been paid to the borrower for that month or as a result of that request. In no event shall the total late charge exceed five hundred dollars. For each additional day that the borrower does not receive payment, the mortgagee shall pay interest at the mortgage interest rate on the late payment. Any late charge and interest shall be paid from the mortgagee's funds and shall not be added to the outstanding loan balance.
