####### Annual adjustments.

(b)The contract rents may be adjusted annually, or more frequently, at HUD's option, either (1) on the basis of a written request for a rent increase submitted by the owner and properly supported by substantiating evidence, or (2) by applying, on each anniversary date of the contract, the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment Factor most recently published by HUD in thein accordance with 24 CFR part 888, subpart B. Published Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors will be reduced appropriately by HUD where utilities are paid directly by Families. If HUD requires that the owner submit a written request, HUD, within a reasonable time, shall approve a rental schedule that is necessary to compensate for any increase in taxes (other than income taxes) and operating and maintenance costs over which owners have no effective control, or shall deny the increase stating the reasons therefor. Increases in taxes and maintenance and operating costs shall be measured against levels of such expenses in comparable assisted and unassisted housing in the area to ensure that adjustments in the Contract Rents shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units. Contract Rents may be adjusted upward or downward as may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the adjusted rents be less than the contract rents on the effective date of the contract.
