###### Classified documents.

(1)Exemption 1 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)) protects classified national defense and foreign relations information. The OIG seldom relies on this exception to withhold documents. However, where applicable, the OIG will refer a request for records classified under Executive Order 13526 and the pertinent records to the originating agency for processing. The OIG may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of the requested information if the originating agency determines that the fact of the existence of the information itself is classified.
