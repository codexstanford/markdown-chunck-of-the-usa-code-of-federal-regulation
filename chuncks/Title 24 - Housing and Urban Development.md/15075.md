(ii)If the Department ceases to issue guarantees in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, HUD will notify the tribe of the reasons for such action and that the tribe may, within 30 days after notification of HUD's action, file a written appeal with the Director, Office of Loan Guarantee (OLG), Office of Native American Programs (ONAP). Within 30 days after notification of an adverse decision by the OLG Director, the tribe may file a written request for review with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for ONAP. Upon notification of an adverse decision by the Deputy Assistant Secretary, the tribe has 30 additional days to file an appeal with the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. The determination of the Assistant Secretary shall be final, but the tribe may resubmit the issue to the Assistant Secretary for review at any subsequent time, if new evidence or changed circumstances warrant reconsideration. (Any other administrative actions determined to be necessary to debar a tribe from participating in this program will be subject to the formal debarment procedures contained in 2 CFR part 2424.)
