####### PHA responsibilities.

(c)(1) The PHA policy must describe how the PHA determines which family members are subject to or exempt from the service requirement, and the process for determining any changes to exempt or non-exempt status of family members.

(2) The PHA must give the family a written description of the service requirement, and of the process for claiming status as an exempt person and for PHA verification of such status. The PHA must also notify the family of its determination identifying the family members who are subject to the service requirement, and the family members who are exempt persons. The PHA must also notify the family that it will be validating a sample of self-certifications of completion of the service requirement accepted by the PHA under ยง 960.607(a)(1)(ii).

(4) The PHA must retain reasonable documentation of service requirement performance or exemption in a participant family's files.

(5) The PHA must comply with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at ยง 5.105(a) of this title and affirmatively further fair housing in all their activities in accordance with the AFFH Certification as described in ยง 903.7(o) of this chapter.
