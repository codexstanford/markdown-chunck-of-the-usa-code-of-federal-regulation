###### Reduction for failure to obtain return of misused funds.

(b)(1) If, in any year, a grantee fails to obtain reimbursement or return of the full amount required to be reimbursed or returned to the grantee during the year, the amount of the grant for the grantee for the succeeding year will be reduced by the amount by which the amounts required to be reimbursed or returned exceed the amount actually reimbursed or returned.

(2) In any case in which a failure to obtain reimbursement or return occurs during a year immediately preceding a year in which HTF grants will not be made, the grantee shall pay to HUD, for reallocation among the other grantees, an amount equal to the amount of the reduction for the entity that would otherwise apply.
