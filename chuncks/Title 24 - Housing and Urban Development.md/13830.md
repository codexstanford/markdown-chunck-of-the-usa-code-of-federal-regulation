######## HQS standards for SRO.

(a)The HQS in § 982.401 apply to SRO housing. However, the standards in this section apply in place of § 982.401(b) (sanitary facilities), § 982.401(c) (food preparation and refuse disposal), and § 982.401(d) (space and security). Since the SRO units will not house children, the housing quality standards in § 982.401(j), concerning lead-based paint, do not apply to SRO housing.
