######## Responsibility for enforcement and administration.,e.g.,

(e)The Commissioner retains responsibility for enforcement of labor standards under this section, but the Commissioner may delegate to the HFA information collection (payroll review and routine interviews) and other routine administration and enforcement functions, subject to monitoring by the Commissioner. Where routine administration and enforcement functions are delegated to the HFA, the HFA shall bear financial responsibility for any deficiency in payment of prevailing wages or, where applicable under 29 CFR part 1 (Procedures for Predetermination of Wage Rates), any increase in compensation to a contractor, that is attributable to any failure properly to carry out its delegated functions. For example, failure of an HFA to supply or ensure inclusion of the proper contract clauses or wage determination in a contract or building loan agreement may require the HFA to fund increased compensation to a contractor as the result of increased wages attributable to incorporation of the proper clauses and wage determination.
