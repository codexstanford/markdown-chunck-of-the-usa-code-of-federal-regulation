(b)While 2 CFR 200.319 requires that grantees solicit full and open competition for their procurements, the HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 provides an exception to this requirement. PHAs are authorized to obtain any line of insurance from a nonprofit insurance entity that is owned and controlled by PHAs and approved by HUD in accordance with this section, without regard to competitive selection procedures. Procurement of insurance from other entities is subject to competitive selection procedures.
