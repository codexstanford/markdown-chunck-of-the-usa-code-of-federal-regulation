######## Projects covered by an insured or Secretary-held mortgage.

(g)In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, projects which are covered by an FHA-insured project mortgage, or by a mortgage held by the Secretary, must be in compliance with a conversion plan approved by the Commissioner. The conversion plan shall provide for:

(1) The termination by payment in full of the mortgage or by voluntary termination of the insurance contract covering any HUD/FHA-insured or Secretary-held mortgage on the project, unless the Commissioner determines that the Commissioner's interests, and those of the individuals purchasing the family units, are best served by not requiring the termination of the insurance or payment in full of the mortgage.

(2) On release of a family unit from the project mortgage, payment shall be made on the outstanding balance of the project mortgage in an amount equal to the share of the balance determined by HUD to be attributable to the family unit.

(3) The project mortgagee shall certify that, notwithstanding any provisions of the mortgage covering prepayment, no charge is contemplated or has been collected for prepayment in full of the project mortgage.
