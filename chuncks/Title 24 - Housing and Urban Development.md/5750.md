(ii)Changes in the mortgage interest rate charged on an adjustable interest rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities (CMT) adjusted to a constant maturity of one year; to the 30-day average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR); or to an alternative SOFR tenor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may publish approved SOFR tenors as alternatives to the 30-day average SOFR tenor through notice. The index type used to calculate the initial mortgage interest rate must be the same index type used to calculate the mortgage interest rate adjustments, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Commingling of index types for the mortgage interest rate and adjustments is not otherwise allowed, unless approved by the Secretary. Unless otherwise provided in this section, each periodic adjustment in the mortgage interest rate must correspond to the upward and downward change in the index, except that downward changes in the index will not result in an index figure that is less than zero.
