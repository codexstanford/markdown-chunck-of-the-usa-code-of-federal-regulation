####### Admission.

The point when the family becomes a participant in the PHA's tenant-based or project-based voucher program (initial receipt of tenant-based or project-based assistance). After admission, and so long as the family is continuously assisted with tenant-based or project-based voucher assistance from the PHA, a shift from tenant-based or project-based assistance to the other form of voucher assistance is not a new admission.
