####### Establishing allocation areas.

(b)Allocation areas, consisting of one or more counties or independent cities, shall be established by the field office in accordance with the following criteria:

(1) Each allocation shall be to the smallest practicable area, but of sufficient size so that at least three eligible entities are viable competitors for funds in the allocation area, and so that all applicable statutory requirements can be met. (It is expected that in many instances individual MSAs will be established as metropolitan allocation areas.) For the section 202 program for the elderly, the allocation area must include sufficient units to promote a meaningful competition among disparate types of providers of such housing (e.g., local as well as national sponsors, minority as well as non-minority sponsors). The preceding sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.

(2) Each allocation area shall also be of sufficient size, in terms of population and housing need, that the amount of budget authority being allocated to the area will support at least one feasible program or project.

(3) In establishing allocation areas, counties and independent cities within MSAs should not be combined with counties that are not in MSAs.
