####### The indicator:

(1)This indicator shows whether the PHA enters into HAP contracts for the number of the PHA's baseline voucher units (units that are contracted under a Consolidated ACC) for the calendar year that ends on or before the PHA's fiscal year or whether the PHA has expended its allocated budget authority for the same calendar year. Allocated budget authority will be based upon the PHA's eligibility, which includes budget authority obligated for the calendar year and any portion of HAP reserves attributable to the budget authority that was offset from reserves during the calendar year. Litigation units and funding will be excluded from this indicator, and new increments will be excluded for 12 months from the effective date of the increment on the Consolidated ACC. Units assisted under the voucher homeownership option and units occupied under a project-based HAP contract are included in the measurement of this indicator.
