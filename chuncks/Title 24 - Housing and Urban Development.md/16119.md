###### ยง 3282.12 Excluded structures - modular homes.

(a) The purpose of this section is to provide the certification procedure authorized by section 604(h) of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act under which modular homes may be excluded from coverage of the Act if the manufacturer of the structure elects to have them excluded. If a manufacturer wishes to construct a structure that is both a manufactured home and a modular home, the manufacturer need not make the certification provided for by this section and may meet both the Federal manufactured home requirements and any modular housing requirements. When the certification is not made, all provisions of the Federal requirements shall be met.
