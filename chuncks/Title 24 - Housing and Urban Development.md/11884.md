####### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).

(3)The DSCR is the ratio of net operating income available to make debt payments, to the amount of the debt payments. This subindicator is used if the PHA has taken on long-term obligations. A DSCR of less than one would indicate that the project would have difficulty generating sufficient cash flow to cover both its expenses and its debt obligations.
