######## Retention and acceptance of offers.

(h)The owner shall accept or reject any bona fide offer within 30 days of receipt of such offer. For an offer to be bona fide, it must meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section, as well as be submitted to the owner within the appropriate marketing period under paragraph (c) of this section. If an owner rejects any offer, it must return the earnest money deposit to the offeror at the time of rejection. A bona fide offer which is rejected by the owner will still be considered a bona fide offer for purposes of this section, even after the earnest money deposit has been returned. If an owner decides to accept the offer at a later date, the purchaser may renew the offer by resubmitting the earnest money deposit, if a deposit had originally been required, within 30 days of notification of the owner's acceptance of the offer.
