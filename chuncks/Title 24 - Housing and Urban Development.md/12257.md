The LHA may also contract with the HBA to perform some or all of the functions of project management for which the HBA may be better suited or located than the LHA. Such functions may include security, maintenance of common property, or collection of monthly payments. For this purpose, the HBA may form a management corporation and the officers of the HBA shall be the directors of such corporation. This corporation and the LHA shall then negotiate a management services contract. Such arrangements are consistent with the objective of providing for maximum participation by residents in the management of their developments. As an alternative, the HBA and the LHA may elect to undertake any other arrangement approved by HUD.
