(d)For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, restrictions of the following types are permitted for eligible governmental or nonprofit programs, provided that a violation of legal restrictions on conveyance may not be grounds for acceleration of the insured mortgaged or for an increase in the interest rate, or for voiding a conveyance of the mortgagor's interest in the property, terminating the mortgagor's interest in the property, or subjecting the mortgagor to contractual liability other than requiring repayment (at a reasonable rate of interest) of assistance provided to make the property affordable as low- or moderate-income housing:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) and the Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) programs, the mortgagor may be prohibited from selling the property at a price greater than the price permitted under the program, or the mortgagor may be required to pay a portion of the sales proceeds to a governmental body or an eligible nonprofit organization, as long as the mortgagor is not prohibited from recovering:

(i) The sum of the mortgagor's original purchase price, the mortgagor's reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made by the mortgagor, and any negative amortization on a graduated payment mortgage insured under ยง 203.45 of this part; and

(ii) A reasonable share, as determined by the Secretary, of the appreciation in value which shall be the sales price reduced by the sum determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.

(2) Legal restrictions on conveyance may extend beyond the term of the mortgage, subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section and any limitations applicable in the jurisdiction.

(3) Except as otherwise required by the HOME and HOPE programs, rights under an option to purchase, pre-emptive rights to purchase or rights of first refusal shall only be held by a governmental body or eligible nonprofit organization, or another individual or organization approved by the Secretary, and shall be exercised by them (or an assignee who will purchase and occupy the property) only within a reasonable time after the event permitting exercise of the rights occurs, not to exceed a period of time determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may approve another individual or organization under the preceding sentence even if the restriction is not part of an eligible governmental or nonprofit program.

(4) In addition to the restrictions stated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the purchase price under an option may not be less than the sum of the mortgagor's original purchase price, the mortgagor's reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made by seller, and a reasonable share, as determined by the Secretary, of the appreciation in value.

(5) The mortgagor may be required to continue to be an owner-occupant.

(6) The mortgagor may be limited in his or her ability to choose a purchaser for the property, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that the property is preserved as low- or moderate-income housing.

(7) The mortgagor for a rehabilitation loan insured under ยง 203.50 of this part may hold title subject to a condition subsequent, provided that the holder of the right of entry for condition broken also executes the mortgage, and that the right is exercisable only for failure by the mortgagor to complete the rehabilitation or occupy the property as agreed by the mortgagor.

(8) Property may be subject to a legal restriction on conveyance to the extent approved in writing by an authorized representative of the Secretary prior to September 10, 1993.
