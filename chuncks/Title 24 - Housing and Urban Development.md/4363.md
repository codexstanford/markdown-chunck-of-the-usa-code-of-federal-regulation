######### Increase in firm commitment before endorsement.

(1)An application, filed before initial endorsement (or before endorsement in a case involving insurance upon completion), for an increase in the amount of an outstanding firm commitment, shall be accompanied by a combined additional application and commitment fee. This combined additional fee shall be in an amount that will aggregate $5 per thousand dollars of the amount of the requested increase. If an inspection fee was required in the original commitment, an additional inspection fee shall be paid in an amount computed at the same dollar rate per thousand dollars of the amount of increase in commitment as was used for the inspection fee required in the original commitment. When insurance of advances is involved, the additional inspection fee shall be paid at the time of initial endorsement. When insurance upon completion is involved, the additional inspection fee shall be paid before the date construction is begun; or, if construction has begun, it shall be paid with the application for increase.
