####### Ground anchor certification and testing.

(a)(1) Each ground anchor assembly must be manufactured and provided with installation instructions, and must be labeled or otherwise identified and subject to an on-going quality assurance surveillance program in accordance with its listing or certification (see 24 CFR 3285.5) by a nationally recognized testing laboratory. A registered professional engineer or architect must certify that each ground anchor assembly is capable of resisting all loads in paragraph (c) of this section based on the test methods in paragraph (b) of this section for use in soil(s) classified in accordance with ยง 3285.202.

(2) Each ground anchor assembly that has been listed prior to November 10, 2014 is not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, provided it has been previously tested in accordance with this paragraph. A professional engineer or registered architect must have certified the testing. The ground anchor must be listed by a nationally recognized testing agency and the listing or certification includes or has met all of the following requirements:

(i) A minimum of three tests meeting all of the requirements of this section were conducted for each ground anchor assembly design;

(ii) Each of the ground anchor assembly designs tested must have met or exceeded a working load of 3,150 pounds and sustained an ultimate load of 4,725 pounds in the weakest soil classification for which the anchors were tested and certified;

(iii) The soil in which the anchor was certified has been classified by one of the methods indicated in ยง 3285.202 of these Standards and the anchor is not listed for use in a weaker/higher soil classification than tested and identified in the Table to ยง 3285.202;

(iv) A test report was provided for each ground anchor assembly design that identifies the soil classification in which the ground anchor was tested and listed and includes complete specifications and dimensions for the ground anchor assembly;

(v) For each of the ground anchor assemblies tested, the maximum deflection at 3,150 pounds did not exceed two inches vertically or three inches horizontally;

(vi) For each of the ground anchor assemblies tested, the maximum deflection at 4,725 pounds did not exceed two inches vertically or three inches horizontally;

(vii) For the stabilizer plate test method, at least three tests were performed at the minimum angle of pull to the horizontal specified in the listing and the minimum angle of pull to the horizontal must have been at least 30 degrees. Any existing ground anchor assembly tests and certifications where the angle of pull was less than 30 degrees will need to be re-evaluated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and

(viii) For the stabilizer plate test method, the minimum angle of pull to the horizontal is specified in the listing.
