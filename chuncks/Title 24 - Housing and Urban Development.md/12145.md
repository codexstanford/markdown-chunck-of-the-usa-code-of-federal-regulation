####### The Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement.

2.Under this Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement, the Homebuyer may achieve ownership of the home described in Part I by making the required monthly payments and providing maintenance and repairs to build up a credit in his Earned Home Payments Account (hereinafter called "EHPA"). While the Homebuyer is performing his obligations, the purchase price will be reduced in accordance with the Purchase Price Schedule, so that, while this purchase price is being reduced, the Homebuyer is increasing the amount of his EHPA. The Homebuyer may also make voluntary payments to his EHPA which will enable him to acquire ownership more quickly. The Homebuyer may take title to his Home when he is able to finance or pay in full the balance of the purchase price as shown on the Purchase Price Schedule plus the costs incidental to acquiring ownership, as provided in section 16 or 17, as applicable.
