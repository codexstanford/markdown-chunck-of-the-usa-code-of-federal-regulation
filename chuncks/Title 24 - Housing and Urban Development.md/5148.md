######## ยง 203.10 Informed consumer choice for prospective FHA mortgagors.
######### Format of disclosure notice.

(2)The informed consumer choice disclosure notice must be provided in a format prescribed by the Commissioner. HUD has prepared a model informed consumer choice disclosure notice that represents this format and that meets the requirements of section 203(b)(2) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)(2)). The model informed consumer choice disclosure notice contains the minimum elements of an informed consumer choice disclosure notice. These elements must be included in a mortgagee's informed consumer choice disclosure notice. A mortgagee, however, may include additional elements in an informed consumer choice disclosure notice to better reflect the mortgagee's products or to provide information that the mortgagee believes is meaningful and helpful to the mortgagee's customers.
