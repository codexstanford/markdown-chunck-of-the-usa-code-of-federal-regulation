######## Exceptions: Thresholds requirements.

(4)Upon written request by the State, an exception to the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section involving an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the State may be granted by HUD on a case-by-case basis. In all other cases, the State may grant such an exception upon written request of the unit of general local government provided the State shall fully document its determination in compliance with all requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section including the State's position with respect to each factor at paragraph (h)(5) of this section and such documentation shall be available for review by the public and by HUD. An exception may be granted after it is determined that such an exception will serve to further the purpose of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the program or project of the State or unit of general local government as appropriate. An exception may be considered only after the State or unit of general local government, as appropriate, has provided the following:

(i) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and

(ii) An opinion of the attorney for the State or the unit of general local government, as appropriate, that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law.
