######## Initiation of negotiations.

(3)For purposes of determining the type of replacement housing payment assistance to be provided to a displaced person pursuant to this section:

(i) If the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, "initiation of negotiations" means the execution of the agreement between the recipient and the subrecipient or the agreement between the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling the property;

(ii) If site control is only evidenced by an option contract to acquire the property, the "initiation of negotiations" does not become effective until the execution of a written agreement that creates a legally enforceable commitment to proceed with the purchase, such as a sales contract.
