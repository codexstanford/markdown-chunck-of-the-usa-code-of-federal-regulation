####### Amendment to add contract units.

(b)At the discretion of the PHA, and provided that the total number of units in a project that will receive PBV assistance will not exceed 25 percent of the total number of dwelling units in the project (assisted and unassisted), (unless units were initially identified in the HAP contract as excepted from the 25 percent limitation in accordance with ยง 983.56(b)), or the 20 percent of authorized budget authority as provided in ยง 983.6, a HAP contract may be amended during the three-year period immediately following the execution date of the HAP contract to add additional PBV contract units in the same project. An amendment to the HAP contract is subject to all PBV requirements (e.g., rents are reasonable), except that a new PBV request for proposals is not required. The anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract for the additional units must be the same as the anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract term for the PBV units originally placed under HAP contract.
