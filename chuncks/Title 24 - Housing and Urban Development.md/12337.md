####### Emergency work.

Capital Fund related physical work items that if not done pose an immediate threat to the health or safety of residents, and which must be completed within one year of funding. Management Improvements are not eligible as emergency work and therefore must be covered by the CFP 5-Year Action Plan before the PHA may carry them out.
