######### Second mortgage.

(c)If the contract of insurance is terminated as provided in ยง 206.133(c), all payments to the borrower by the Commissioner will be secured by the second mortgage, unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner. Payments will be due and payable in the same manner as under the insured first mortgage. The liability of the borrower under the first mortgage shall be limited to payments actually made by the mortgagee to or on behalf of the borrower (including prior recoupment of the MIP remitted by the mortgagee and billed to the borrower), and shall exclude accrued interest, whether or not it has been included in the outstanding loan balance, and shared appreciation, if any. Interest will stop accruing on the first mortgage when the Commissioner begins to make payments under the second mortgage. The first mortgage will not be due and payable until the second mortgage is due and payable.
