###### ยง 401.451 PAE Physical Condition Analysis (PCA).
####### Rejection due to poor condition of the project.

(c)Based on the completed PCA, the PAE must determine whether proceeding with a Restructuring Plan with necessary rehabilitation is more cost-effective in terms of Federal resources than rejecting the Request for a Restructuring Plan under ยง 401.403(b)(2)(iii) and providing tenant-based assistance for displaced tenants under ยง 401.602. HUD will provide guidance to PAEs for making the determination. If the PAE concludes that a request for a Restructuring Plan should be rejected because of lack of cost-effectiveness due to poor condition of the project, it must also consider the effect on tenants and the community and advise HUD of the effect. HUD will make the final decision after considering the PAE's recommendation.
