####### Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover.

Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover means the party that incurs more than half the costs incurred in:

(1) Recertifying tenants who fraudulently obtained section 8 rental assistance;

(2) Recomputing the correct amounts owed by tenants; and

(3) Taking needed actions to recoup the excess benefits received, such as initiating litigation.

Costs incurred to detect potential excessive benefits in the routine day-to-day operations of the program are excluded in determining the principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover. For example, the cost of income verification during an annual recertification would not be counted in determining the principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover.
