####### Application of EHPA upon vacating of dwelling.

k.(1) In the event this Agreement is terminated or if the Homebuyer vacates the Home, the Authority shall charge against the Homebuyer's EHPA the amounts required to pay; (i) The amount due the Authority, including the monthly payments the Homebuyer is obligated to pay up to the date he vacates; (ii) the monthly payment for the period the Home is vacant, not to exceed 30 days from the date of notice of intention to vacate, or if the Homebuyer failed to give notice of intention to vacate, 30 days from the date the Home is put in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with section 6; and (iii) the cost of any routine maintenance, and of any nonroutine maintenance attributable to the negligence of the Homebuyer, required to put the Home in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with section 6.

(2) If the Homebuyer's EHPA balance is not sufficient to cover all of these charges, the Authority shall require the Homebuyer to pay the additional amount due. If the amount in the EHPA exceeds these charges, the excess shall be paid the Homebuyer.

(3) Settlement with the Homebuyer shall be made promptly after the actual cost of repairs to the dwelling has been determined (see paragraph k(1)(iii) of this section), provided that the Authority shall make every effort to make such settlement within 30 days from the date the Homebuyer vacates. The Homebuyer may obtain a settlement within 7 days of the date he vacates, even though the actual cost of such repairs has not yet been determined, if he has given the Authority notice of intention to vacate 30 days prior to the date he vacates and if the amount to be charged against his EHPA for such repairs is based on the Authority's estimate of the cost thereof (determined after consultation with the appropriate representative of the HBA).
