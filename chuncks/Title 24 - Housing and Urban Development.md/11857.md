###### ยง 902.22 Physical inspection of PHA projects.
####### The inspection, generally.

(a)The PHA's score for the physical condition indicator is based on an independent physical inspection of a PHA's project(s) provided by HUD and using HUD's Uniform Physical Condition Standard (UPCS) inspection protocols to ensure projects meet DSS/GR standards that constitute acceptable basic housing conditions. Mixed-finance projects will be subject to the physical condition inspections.

(b) Pursuant to ยง 902.13(a), PHAs with less than 250 public housing units will receive a PHAS assessment, based on their PHAS designation, as follows:

(1) A small PHA that is a high performer will receive a PHAS assessment every 3 years;

(2) A small PHA that is a standard or substandard performer will receive a PHAS assessment every other year; and

(3) All other small PHAs will receive a PHAS assessment every year, including a PHA that is designated as troubled or Capital Fund-troubled in accordance with ยง 902.75.

(c) In the baseline year, every PHA will receive an overall PHAS score and in all four of the PHAS indicators: Physical condition; financial condition; management operations; and Capital Fund program. This will allow a baseline score to be established for the physical condition inspections and the 3-2-1 inspection schedule, as well as a baseline year for the small deregulated PHAs.
