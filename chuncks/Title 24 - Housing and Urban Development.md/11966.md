###### ยง 903.2 With respect to admissions, what must a PHA do to deconcentrate poverty in its developments?
####### General.

(a)The PHA's admission policy includes the PHA's policy designed to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in accordance with section 16(a)(3)(B) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437n), which is submitted to HUD as part of the PHA Annual Plan process. Deconcentration of poverty and income mixing is promoted by a policy that provides for bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and lower income tenants into higher income developments.

(1) The provisions of this section apply to applicants to and residents seeking voluntary transfers within covered public housing developments ("covered developments" as specified in paragraph (b) of this section).

(2) The statutory requirement to design a policy to provide for deconcentration and income mixing is not to be construed to impose or require any specific income or racial quotas for any development or developments.
