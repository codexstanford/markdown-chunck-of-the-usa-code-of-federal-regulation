(c)Eligible project costs may be incurred during the current program year in an amount not to exceed 25% of the current HOME allocation amount, to be charged to the following year's HOME allocation. Before incurring the pre-award costs, the participating jurisdiction must comply with its citizen participation plan requirements addressing 24 CFR 91.105(b)(2), (4), (5) and (g) (local governments) or 24 CFR 91.115(b)(2), (4), (5) and (f) (States). In lieu of a full action plan, the participating jurisdiction may develop a mini-action plan which describes the proposed pre-award projects and costs in accordance with 24 CFR 91.220(c) and includes, if applicable, 24 CFR 91.220(g)(2) (local governments) or 24 CFR 91.320(c) and, if applicable, 24 CFR 91.320(g)(2) (States). The mini-action plan must state that HOME funding for the project(s) is subject to the future availability of HOME funds. The subsequent action plan (i.e., action plan for the HOME allocation to which the costs will be charged) must also include the use of HOME funds contained in the mini-action plan.
