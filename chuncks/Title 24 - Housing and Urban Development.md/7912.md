(c)-(1)This paragraph (c)(1) explains how a purchaser (or a servicer of a purchased mortgage loan) must service a mortgage loan that was assigned to HUD under section 230(b) of the National Housing Act (as that subsection existed prior to January 26, 1996), for which not more than 36 months has expired since the mortgage loan assignment was accepted by the Secretary. Such a purchaser must service these mortgage loans in essentially the same manner as HUD was required to service the loans while HUD held them. Specific servicing requirements will be set forth in the Loan Sale Agreement for each sale.
