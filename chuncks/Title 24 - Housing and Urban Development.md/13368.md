######## The development has a vacancy rate of at least a specified percent for dwelling units not in funded, on-schedule modernization, for each of the last three years, and the vacancy rate has not significantly decreased in those three years.

(b)(1) For a conversion analysis performed on or before March 16, 2009, the specified vacancy rate is 15 percent. For a conversion analysis performed after that date, the specified vacancy rate is 12 percent.

(2) For the determination of vacancy rates, the PHA must use the data it relied upon for the PHA's latest Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) certification, as reported on the Form HUD-51234 (report on Occupancy). Units in the following categories must not be included in this calculation:

(i) Vacant units in an approved demolition or disposition program;

(ii) Vacant units in which resident property has been abandoned, but only if state law requires the property to be left in the unit for some period of time, and only for the period of time stated in the law;

(iii) Vacant units that have sustained casualty damage, but only until the insurance claim is adjusted;

(iv) Units that are occupied by employees of the PHA and units that are used for resident services; and

(v) Units that HUD determines, in its sole discretion, are intentionally vacant and do not indicate continued distress.
