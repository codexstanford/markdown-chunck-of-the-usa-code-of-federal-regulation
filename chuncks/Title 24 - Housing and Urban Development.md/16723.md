(b)When at the time of purchase the purchaser does not know the locale for the initial siting of the home for occupancy, the retailer must advise the purchaser that:

(1) The home was designed and constructed for specific wind, thermal, and roof load zones; and

(2) If the home is sited in a different zone, the home may not pass the required installation inspection because the home will have been installed in a manner that would take it out of compliance with the construction and safety standards in part 3280 of this chapter.
