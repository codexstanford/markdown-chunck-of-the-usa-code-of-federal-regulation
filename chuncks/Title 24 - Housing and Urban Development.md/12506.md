###### ยง 905.400 Capital Fund formula (CF formula).
####### CF formula capping.

(h)(1) For units that are eligible for funding under the CF formula (including replacement housing units discussed below), a PHA's CF formula share shall be its share of capital need, as determined under the CF formula, subject to the condition that no PHA's CF formula share for units funded under the CF formula can be less than 94 percent of its formula share had the FFY 1999 formula system been applied to these CF formula-eligible units. The FFY 1999 formula system is based upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Grant formula system for PHAs with 250 or more units in FFY 1999 and upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system for PHAs with fewer than 250 units in FFY 1999.

(2) For a Moving to Work (MTW) PHA whose MTW agreement provides that its CF formula share is to be calculated in accordance with the previously existing formula, the PHA's CF formula share, during the term of the MTW agreement, may be approximately the formula share that the PHA would have received had the FFY 1999 formula funding system been applied to the CF formula eligible units.
