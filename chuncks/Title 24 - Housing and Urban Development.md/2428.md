Such notice shall include aggregate data on labor hours and the proportion of recipients meeting benchmarks, as well as other metrics reported pursuant to ยง 75.25 as deemed appropriate by HUD, for the 3 most recent reporting years.

(ii) The number of labor hours worked by Targeted Section 3 workers as defined in ยง 75.21(a), divided by the total number of labor hours worked by all workers on a Section 3 project in the recipient's program year.
