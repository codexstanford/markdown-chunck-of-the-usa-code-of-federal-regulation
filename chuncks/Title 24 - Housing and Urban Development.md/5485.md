(b)If, for any reason, the mortgagee fails to comply with the regulations in this subpart, the Secretary may hold processing of the application for insurance benefits in abeyance for a reasonable time in order to permit the mortgagee to comply.

The mortgagee may reapply for insurance benefits at a subsequent date; provided, however, that the mortgagee may not be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in connection with the property after it has been reconveyed by the Secretary, or paid any debenture interest accrued after the date of initial conveyance or after the date conveyance was required by ยง 203.359 of this part, whichever is earlier, and there will be deducted from the insurance benefits any reduction in the Secretary's estimate of the value of the property occurring from the time of reconveyance to the time of reapplication.
