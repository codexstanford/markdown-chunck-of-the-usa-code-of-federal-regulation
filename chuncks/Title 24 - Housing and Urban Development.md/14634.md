###### ยง 1000.14 What relocation and real property acquisition policies are applicable?
####### Real Property acquisition requirements.

(a)The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. Whenever the recipient does not have the authority to acquire the real property through condemnation, it shall:

(1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner:

(i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the recipient from accepting a donation or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value.

(ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement.

(2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property if the proposed acquisition payment exceeds the fair market value. The recipient shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and a justification for the proposed acquisition payment. HUD will promptly review the proposal and inform the recipient of its approval or disapproval.
