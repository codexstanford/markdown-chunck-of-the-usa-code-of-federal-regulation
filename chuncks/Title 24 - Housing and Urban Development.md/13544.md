####### Ongoing administrative fee.

(b)(1) The PHA ongoing administrative fee is paid for each program unit under HAP contract on the first day of the month. The amount of the ongoing fee is determined by HUD in accordance with Section 8(q)(1) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(q)(1)).

(2) If appropriations are available, HUD may pay a higher ongoing administrative fee for a small program or a program operating over a large geographic area. This higher fee level will not be approved unless the PHA demonstrates that it is efficiently administering its HCV program, and that the higher ongoing administrative fee is reasonable and necessary for administration of the program in accordance with HUD requirements.

(3) HUD may pay a lower ongoing administrative fee for PHA-owned units.
