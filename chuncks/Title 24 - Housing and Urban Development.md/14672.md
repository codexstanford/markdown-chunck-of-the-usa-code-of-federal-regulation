####### Stage 2.

(B)If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.

(2) If the recipient selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid, or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then the recipient shall:

(i) Readvertise the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or

(ii) Readvertise the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or

(iii) If one approvable bid or proposal is received, request Area ONAP review and approval of the proposed contract and related procurement documents, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.326, in order to award the contract to the single bidder or offeror.

(3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 2 CFR 200.320 need not follow the formal bid or proposal procedures of since these procurements are governed by the small purchase procedures of 2 CFR 200.320. However, a recipient's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.

(4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding or proposal solicitation documents and the bidding and proposal documents.

(5) A recipient, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. Recipients may require prospective contractors to provide the following information before submitting a bid or proposal, or at the time of submission:

(i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership and interest;

(ii) Evidence of structure, management, and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; management salary or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest; and

(iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the recipient that the prospective contractor has the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.

(6) The recipient shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded in connection with a project funded under this part:

(i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)) (the Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that, to the greatest extent feasible:

(A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and

(B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.

(ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of section 7(b) of the Indian Act.

(iii) In connection with this contract, the contractor shall, to the greatest extent feasible, give preference in the award of any subcontracts to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and preferences and opportunities for training and employment to Indians.

(iv) The contractor shall include this section 7(b) clause in every subcontract in connection with the project; shall require subcontractors at each level to include this section 7(b) clause in every subcontract they execute in connection with the project; and shall, at the direction of the recipient, take appropriate action pursuant to the subcontract upon a finding by the recipient or HUD that the subcontractor has violated the section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act.

(d) A recipient shall not be required to apply Indian preference requirements under Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act with respect to any procurement, using a grant provided under NAHASDA, of goods and services with a value less than $5,000.
