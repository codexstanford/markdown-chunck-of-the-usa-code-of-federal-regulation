###### Allocations.

(2)(i) Allocations to the States are determined using the four needs factors described in § 93.51(a) through (d), multiplying each factor by the amount available under § 93.51(d)(1) by its priority weight, and summing the four factors for each State.

(ii) The factor described in § 93.51(a) is weighted 0.5. The factors described in § 93.51(b) and (d) are weighted at 0.125 and the factor described in § 93.51(c) of this section is weighted at 0.25.

(iii) The sum of the four needs factors for each State is then multiplied by the construction cost factor described in § 93.51(e) of this section and by the total amount of funds available for State allocations.
