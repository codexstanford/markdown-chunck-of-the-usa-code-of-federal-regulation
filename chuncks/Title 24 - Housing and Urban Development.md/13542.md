####### Budget authority.

(b)(1) Budget authority is the maximum amount that may be paid by HUD to a PHA over the ACC term of a funding increment. Before adding a funding increment to the consolidated ACC for a PHA program, HUD reserves budget authority from amounts authorized and appropriated by the Congress for the program.

(2) For each funding increment, the ACC specifies the term over which HUD will make payments for the PHA program, and the amount of available budget authority for each funding increment. The amount to be paid to the PHA during each PHA fiscal year (including payment from the ACC reserve account described in ยง 982.154) must be approved by HUD.
