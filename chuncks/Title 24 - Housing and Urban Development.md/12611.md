####### Commitment of funds.

(A)Documents submitted pursuant to this section must irrevocably commit funds to the project. Irrevocability of funds means that binding legal documents-such as loan agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust, partnership agreements or operating agreements, or similar documents committing funds-have been executed by the applicable parties; though disbursement of such funds may be subject to meeting progress milestones, the absence of default, and/or other conditions generally consistent with similar non-public housing transactions. For projects involving revolving loan funds, the irrevocability of funds means that funds in an amount identified to HUD as the maximum revolving loan have been committed pursuant to legally binding documents; though disbursement of such funds may be subject to meeting progress milestones, the absence of default, and/or other conditions generally consistent with similar affordable housing transactions. The PHA must confirm the availability of each party's financing, the amount and source of financing committed to the proposal by the parties, and the irrevocability of those funds.
