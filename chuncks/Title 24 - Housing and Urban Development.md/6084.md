(d)In addition to the insurance benefits paid under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, a certificate of claim shall be issued to the mortgagee.

(1) In the case of an assignment of the mortgage, the certificate shall be for an amount which the Commissioner determines to be sufficient, when added to the amount of the insurance benefits to equal the amount the mortgagee would have received if, on the date of assignment to the Commissioner, the mortgagor had paid in full all obligations under the mortgage. Where a conveyance is involved, there shall also be included in the certificate an allowance in a reasonable amount for any necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise and in connection with the conveyance of the property to the Commissioner.

(2) The certificate of claim shall provide for an uncompounded annual interest increment of 3 percent to begin as of the date of either assignment or conveyance.
