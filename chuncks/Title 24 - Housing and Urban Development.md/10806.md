####### Families determined by the PHA to be ineligible.

(f)If a Family is determined to be ineligible in accordance with the PHA's HUD-approved application, either at the application stage or after assistance has been provided on behalf of the Family, the PHA shall promptly notify the Family by letter of the determination and the reasons for it and the letter shall state that the Family has the right within a reasonable time (specified in the letter) to request an informal hearing. If, after conducting such an informal hearing, the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the Family is ineligible, it shall notify the Family in writing. The procedures of this paragraph do not preclude the Family from exercising its other rights if it believes it is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, familial status, or national origin. The informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal selection preference under ยง 882.517 are contained in paragraph (k) of that section. The informal hearing requirements for denial and termination of assistance on the basis of ineligible immigration status are contained in 24 CFR part 5.
