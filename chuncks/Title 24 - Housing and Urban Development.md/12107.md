###### § 904.112 Operating reserve.
####### Nonroutine maintenance-common property (Contribution to operating reserve).

(b)The amount under this heading to be included in operating expense (and in the break-even amount) established for the fiscal year (see § 904.108 and § 904.109) shall be determined by the LHA, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of estimates of the monthly amount needed to accumulate an adequate reserve for the items described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. This amount shall be subject to revision in the light of experience. This contribution to the operating reserve shall be made only during the period the LHA is responsible for the maintenance of any common property; and during such period, the amount shall be determined on the basis of the requirements of all common property in the development in a manner similar to that explained in § 904.109(c). When the operating reserve reaches the maximum authorized in paragraph (c) of this section, the break-even (monthly operating expense) computations (see §§ 904.108 and 904.109) for the next and succeeding fiscal years need not include a provision for this contribution to the operating reserve unless the balance of the reserve is reduced below the maximum during any such succeeding fiscal year.
