####### Other good cause.

(d)(1) "Other good cause" for termination of tenancy by the owner may include, but is not limited to, any of the following examples:

(i) Failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision;

(ii) A family history of disturbance of neighbors or destruction of property, or of living or housekeeping habits resulting in damage to the unit or premises;

(iii) The owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or

(iv) A business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental).

(2) During the initial lease term, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for "other good cause", unless the owner is terminating the tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do. For example, during this period, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for "other good cause" based on any of the following grounds: failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision; the owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or a business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section).
