#### PART 971 - ASSESSMENT OF THE REASONABLE REVITALIZATION POTENTIAL OF CERTAIN PUBLIC HOUSING REQUIRED BY LAW
##### ยง 971.3 Standards for identifying developments.
###### Be identified as distressed housing that the PHA cannot assure the long-term viability as public housing through reasonable revitalization, density reduction, or achievement of a broader range of household income.

(5)(OCRA Sec. 202(a)(4)). [See ยง 971.5.]

(b) Properties meeting the standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section will be assumed to be "distressed" unless the PHA can show that the property fails the standard set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for reasons that are temporary in duration and are unlikely to recur.

(c) Where the PHA will demolish all of the units in a development, or the portion thereof, that is subject to section 202, section 202 requirements will be satisfied once the demolition occurs and its standards will not be applied further to the use of the site.

(d) PHAs will meet the test for assuring long-term viability of identified housing only if it is probable that, after reasonable investment, for at least twenty years (or at least 30 years for rehabilitation equivalent to new construction) the development can sustain structural/system soundness and full occupancy; will not be excessively densely configured relative to standards for similar (typically family) housing in the community; will not constitute an excessive concentration of very low-income families; and has no other site impairments which clearly should disqualify the site from continuation as public housing.
