###### ยง 882.514 Family participation.
####### Selection of Families for participation.

(b)When vacancies occur, the PHA will refer to the Owner one or more appropriate size Families on its waiting list. The PHA must select Families for participation in accordance with the provisions of the Program and in accordance with the PHA's application, including any PHA requirement or preferences as approved by HUD. The PHA must select Families eligible for housing assistance payments currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation under the Program without requiring that these Families be placed on the waiting list. Notwithstanding the fact that the PHA may not be accepting additional applications for participation because of the length of the waiting list, the PHA may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for partcipation and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part 5, unless the PHA determines, on the basis of the number of applicants who are already on the waiting list and who claim a Federal preference, and the anticipated number of admissions under this part, that-

(1) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a Federal preference and

(2) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's system for applying the Federal preferences, the preference or preferences that the applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants on the waiting list, the applicant would qualify for assistance before other applicants on the waiting list.
