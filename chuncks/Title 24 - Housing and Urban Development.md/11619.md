######## Availability of assisted units for occupancy by eligible families.

(a)(1) During the term of the HAP contract, a Borrower shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the HAP contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the Borrower:

(i) Is conducting marketing in accordance with ยง 891.600(a);

(ii) Has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families;

(iii) Has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD.

(2) If the Borrower is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the HAP contract to eligible families, one or more units may, with the prior approval of HUD, be leased to otherwise eligible families that do not meet the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter. Failure on the part of the Borrower to comply with these requirements is a violation of the HAP contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including an action for specific performance of the HAP contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the HAP contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
