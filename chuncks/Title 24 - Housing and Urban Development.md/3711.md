###### Preserving affordability.

(k)(1) To preserve the affordability of housing that was previously assisted with HTF funds and subject to the requirements of this section, a grantee may use additional HTF funds to acquire the housing through a purchase option, right of first refusal, or other preemptive right before foreclosure, or to acquire the housing at the foreclosure sale, undertake any necessary rehabilitation, and provide assistance to another first-time homebuyer. The housing must be sold to a new eligible homebuyer in accordance with the requirements of this section. Additional HTF funds may not be used if the mortgage in default was funded with HTF funds.

(2) The total amount of original and additional HTF assistance may not exceed the maximum per-unit development subsidy amount established pursuant to ยง 93.300. As an alternative to charging the cost to the HTF program under ยง 93.201, the grantee may charge the cost to the HTF program under ยง 93.302 as a reasonable administrative cost of its HTF program, so that the additional HTF funds for the housing are not subject to the maximum per-unit subsidy amount.
