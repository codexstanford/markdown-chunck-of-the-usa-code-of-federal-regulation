####### Total Development Cost (TDC)

is the sum of all costs for a project including all undertakings necessary for administration, planning, site acquisition, demolition, construction or equipment and financing (including payment of carrying charges) and for otherwise carrying out the development of the project, excluding off site water and sewer. Total Development Cost amounts will be based on a moderately designed house and will be determined by averaging the current construction costs as listed in not less than two nationally recognized residential construction cost indices.
