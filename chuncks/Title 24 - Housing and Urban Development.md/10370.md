####### Local law enforcement agency

means a police department, sheriff's office, or other entity of the governmental jurisdiction that has law enforcement responsibilities for the community at large, including the housing developments owned or administered by the applicant. In Indian jurisdictions, this includes tribal prosecutors that assume law enforcement functions analogous to a police department or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). More than one law enforcement agency may have these responsibilities for the jurisdiction that includes the applicant's developments.
