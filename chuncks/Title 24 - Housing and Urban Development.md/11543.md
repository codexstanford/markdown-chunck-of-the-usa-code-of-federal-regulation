####### Unit assignment.

(d)If the Owner determines that the household is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units (or residential spaces in a group home) are available, the Owner will assign the household a unit or residential space in a group home. If the household will occupy an assisted unit, the Owner will assign the household a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD's general occupancy guidelines. If no suitable unit (or residential space in a group home) is available, the Owner will place the household on a waiting list for the project and notify the household when a suitable unit or residential space may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the Owner may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason.
