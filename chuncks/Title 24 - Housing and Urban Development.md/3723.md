## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development
### PART 93 - HOUSING TRUST FUND
#### Subpart G - Project Requirements
##### ยง 93.305 Qualification as affordable housing: modest housing requirements for homeownership; resale or recapture requirements.
###### Amount subject to recapture.,i.e.,

(E)The HTF assistance that is subject to recapture is based on the amount of HTF assistance that enabled the homebuyer to buy the dwelling unit. This includes any HTF assistance that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an affordable price, but excludes the amount between the cost of producing the unit and the market value of the property (the development subsidy). The recaptured funds must be used to carry out HTF-eligible activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. If the HTF assistance is only used for the development subsidy and therefore not subject to recapture, the resale option must be used.
