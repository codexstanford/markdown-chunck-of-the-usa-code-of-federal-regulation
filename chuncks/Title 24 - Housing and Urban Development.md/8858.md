######## Change of use of real property.

(j)The standards described in this section apply to real property within the unit of general local government's control (including activities undertaken by subrecipients) which was acquired or improved in whole or in part using CDBG funds in excess of the threshold for small purchase procurement (2 CFR 200.88). These standards shall apply from the date CDBG funds are first spent for the property until five years after closeout of the unit of general local government's grant.

(1) A unit of general local governments may not change the use or planned use of any such property (including the beneficiaries of such use) from that for which the acquisition or improvement was made, unless the unit of general local government provides affected citizens with reasonable notice of and opportunity to comment on any proposed change, and either:

(i) The new use of the property qualifies as meeting one of the national objectives and is not a building for the general conduct of government; or

(ii) The requirements in paragraph (j)(2) of this section are met.

(2) If the unit of general local government determines, after consultation with affected citizens, that it is appropriate to change the use of the property to a use which does not qualify under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, it may retain or dispose of the property for the changed use if the unit of general local government's CDBG program is reimbursed or the State's CDBG program is reimbursed, at the discretion of the State. The reimbursement shall be in the amount of the current fair market value of the property, less any portion of the value attributable to expenditures of non-CDBG funds for acquisition of, and improvements to, the property, except that if the change in use occurs after grant closeout but within 5 years of such closeout, the unit of general local government shall make the reimbursement to the State's CDBG program account.

(3) Following the reimbursement of the CDBG program in accordance with paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the property no longer will be subject to any CDBG requirements.
