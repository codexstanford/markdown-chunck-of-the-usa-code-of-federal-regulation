() Previously counted toward any housing goal by the GSE; and

(B) The GSE has the information necessary to support counting the dwelling units financed by the REMIC, or that part of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE, toward the achievement of a particular housing goal.

(ii) For REMICs that meet the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and for which the GSE purchased or guaranteed:

(A) The whole REMIC, all of the units financed by the REMIC shall be treated as a mortgage purchase and count toward achievement of the housing goals; or

(B) A portion of the REMIC, the GSE shall receive partial credit toward achievement of the housing goals. This credit shall be equal to the percentage of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE (the dollar amount of the purchase or guarantee divided by the total dollar amount of the REMIC) multiplied by the number of dwelling units that would have counted toward the goal(s) if the GSE had purchased or guaranteed the whole REMIC. In calculating performance under the housing goals, the denominator shall include the number of dwelling units included in the whole REMIC multiplied by the percentage of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE.
