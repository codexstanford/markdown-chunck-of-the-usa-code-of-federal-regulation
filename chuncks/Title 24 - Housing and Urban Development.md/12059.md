###### ยง 904.104 Eligibility and selection of homebuyers.
####### Eligibility for continued occupancy.

(h)(1) A homebuyer shall cease to be eligible for continued occupancy with the aid of HUD annual contributions when the LHA determines that the homebuyer's adjusted monthly income has reached, and is likely to continue at, a level at which the current amount of the homebuyer's Total Tenant Payment, determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter, equals or exceeds the monthly housing cost (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section). In such event, if the LHA determines, with HUD approval, that suitable financing is available, the LHA shall notify the homebuyer that he or she must either: (1) Purchase the home or (ii) move from the development. If, however, the LHA determines that, because of special circumstances, the family is unable to find decent, safe, and sanitary housing within the family's financial reach although making every reasonable effort to do so, the family may be permitted to remain for the duration of such a situation if it pays as rent an amount equal to Tenant Rent, as determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter. Such a monthly payment shall also be payable by the family if it continues in occupancy without purchasing the home because suitable financing is not available.

(2) The term "monthly housing cost," as used in this paragraph, means the sum of:

(i) The monthly debt service amount shown on the Purchase Price Schedule (except where the homebuyer can purchase the home by the method described in ยง 904.113(c)(1) of this part);

(ii) One-twelfth of the annual real property taxes which the homebuyer will be required to pay as a homeowner;

(iii) One-twelfth of the annual premium attributable to fire and extended coverage insurance carried by the LHA with respect to the home;

(iv) The current monthly per unit amount budgeted for routine maintenance (EHPA), and for routine maintenance-common property; and

(v) The current LHA and HUD approved monthly allowance for utilities paid for directly by the homebuyer plus the monthly cost of utilities supplied by the LHA.
