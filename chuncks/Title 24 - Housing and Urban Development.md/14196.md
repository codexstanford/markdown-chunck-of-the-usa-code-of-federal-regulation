#### PART 983 - PROJECT-BASED VOUCHER (PBV) PROGRAM
##### Subpart F - Occupancy
###### ยง 983.262 When occupancy may exceed 25 percent cap on the number of PBV units in each project.

(a) Except as provided in ยง 983.56(b), the PHA may not pay housing assistance under the HAP contract for contract units in excess of the 25 percent cap pursuant to ยง 983.56(a).

(b) In referring families to the owner for admission to excepted units, the PHA must give preference to elderly and/or disabled families, or to families receiving supportive services.

(c) If a family at the time of initial tenancy is receiving and while the resident of an excepted unit has received FSS supportive services or any other service as defined in the PHA administrative plan, and successfully completes the FSS contract of participation or the supportive services requirement, the unit continues to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in the unit.

(d) A family (or the remaining members of the family) residing in an excepted unit that no longer meets the criteria for a "qualifying family" in connection with the 25 percent per project cap exception (i.e., a family that does not successfully complete its FSS contract of participation or the supportive services requirement as defined in the PHA administrative plan or the remaining members of a family that no longer qualifies for elderly or disabled family status where the PHA does not exercise its discretion under paragraph (e) of this section) must vacate the unit within a reasonable period of time established by the PHA, and the PHA shall cease paying housing assistance payments on behalf of the non-qualifying family. If the family fails to vacate the unit within the established time, the unit must be removed from the HAP contract unless the project is partially assisted, and it is possible for the HAP contract to be amended to substitute a different unit in the project in accordance with ยง 983.207(a); or the owner terminates the lease and evicts the family. The housing assistance payments for a family residing in an excepted unit that is not in compliance with its family obligations (e.g., a family fails, without good cause, to successfully complete its FSS contract of participation or supportive services requirement) shall be terminated by the PHA.

(e) The PHA may allow a family that initially qualified for occupancy of an excepted unit based on elderly or disabled family status to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family (e.g., death of the elderly or disabled family member or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly or disabled family member no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in that unit. Once the family vacates the unit, in order to continue as an excepted unit under the HAP contact, the unit must be made available to and occupied by a qualifying family.
