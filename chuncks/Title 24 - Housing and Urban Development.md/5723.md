######## Principal residence

means the dwelling where the borrower and, if applicable, Non-Borrowing Spouse, maintain their permanent place of abode, and typically spend the majority of the calendar year. A person may have only one principal residence at any one time. The property shall be considered to be the principal residence of any borrower who is temporarily in a health care institution provided the borrower's residency in a health care institution does not exceed twelve consecutive months. The property shall be considered to be the principal residence of any Non-Borrowing Spouse, who is temporarily in a health care institution, as long as the property is the principal residence of his or her borrower spouse, who physically resides in the property. During a Deferral Period, the property shall continue to be considered to be the principal residence of any Non-Borrowing Spouse, who is temporarily in a health care institution, provided he or she qualified as an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse and physically occupied the property immediately prior to entering the health care institution and his or her residency in a health care institution does not exceed twelve consecutive months.
