On a dealer loan, the inspection shall be completed within 60 days after the date of disbursement. On a direct loan, the inspection shall be completed within 60 days after receipt of the completion certificate, or as soon as the lender determines that the borrower is unwilling to cooperate in submitting the completion certificate.

If the borrower will not cooperate in permitting an on-site inspection, the lender shall report this fact to the Secretary.
