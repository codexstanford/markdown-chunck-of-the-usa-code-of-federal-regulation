(4) Be complete and ready for occupancy, including completion of all the common elements of the project, and not subject to further rehabilitation, construction, phasing, or annexation, except to the extent that approval is sought for legal phasing in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section;

(5) Be reviewed and approved by the local jurisdiction with respect to the condominium plat or similar development plan and any phases; if applicable, the approved plat or development plan must have been recorded in the land records of the jurisdiction; and

(6) Meet such further approval requirements as provided by the Commissioner through notices with respect to:

(i) Nature of title to realty or leasehold interests;

(ii) Control over, and organization of, the Condominium Association;

(iii) Minimum insurance coverage for the Condominium Project;

(iv) Planned or actual special assessments;

(v) Financial condition of the Condominium Project, including, but not limited to, the allowable percentage of units owned by a single owner or group of related owners;

(vi) Existence of any pending legal action, or physical property condition;

(vii) Acceptable maximum percentages of commercial/non-residential space, which must be within a range between 25 and 55 percent of the total floor area (which range may be changed following the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section), with the specific maximum and minimum percentages within that range to be established by HUD through notice, provided that such commercial/non-residential space does not negatively impact the residential use of the project or create adverse conditions to the occupants of individual condominium units.

(viii) Acceptable maximum percentages of units with FHA-insured mortgages, which must be within a range between 25 and 75 percent of the total number of units in the project (which range may be changed following the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section), with the specific maximum percentage of units with FHA-insured mortgages within that range to be established by HUD through notice. HUD may suspend the issuance of new FHA case numbers for a mortgage on a property located in any project where the number of FHA-insured mortgages exceeds the maximum insurance concentration established by HUD.

(ix) Acceptable minimum level of owner occupancy, which shall include units occupied as a principal or secondary residence or sold to an owner who intends to meet such occupancy requirements. Such acceptable minimum levels shall be within a range between 30 and 75 percent of the total number of units in the project (which range may be changed following the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section), with a specific minimum percentage to be established by HUD through notice. For the sole purpose of calculating the owner-occupancy percentage under this paragraph, any unit that is occupied by the owner as his or her place of abode for any portion of the calendar year other than as a principal residence and that is not rented for a majority of the calendar year shall count towards the total number of secondary residences.

(x) Reserve requirements, provided the reserve account is funded with at least 10 percent of the monthly unit assessments, unless a lower amount is deemed acceptable by HUD based on a reserve study completed not more than 36 months before a request for a lower amount is received, or such greater amount of time as determined by the Secretary under the HUD review and approval process.

(xi) Such other matters that may affect the viability or marketability of the project or its units.

(e) Phases of a project are approvable, provided that only legal phasing is used. Individual phases must be separately sustainable as required by HUD, so that the insurance fund is not put at undue risk. In determining whether to accept legal phasing, HUD will assess the potential risk to the insurance fund and other factors that HUD may publish in notices. Phases must meet HUD's requirements for approval in paragraph (d) of this section and must at a minimum be:

(1) In a vertical building, contiguous, with all units built out and having a certificate of occupancy; or

(2) In a detached or semi-detached development, where all homes in the phase are built out and have a certificate of occupancy;

(f) The Secretary will publish any generally applicable change in the upper and lower limits of the ranges of percentages in paragraphs (d)(6)(vii) through (ix) of this section in a notice published for 30 days of public comment. After considering the comments, the Department will publish a final notice announcing the new overall upper and lower limits of the range of percentages being implemented, and the date on which the new standard becomes effective.

(g) The Secretary may grant an exception to any specifically prescribed requirements within paragraph (d)(6) of this section on a case-by-case basis in HUD's discretion, provided that:

(1) In the case of an exception to the approval requirements for the commercial/nonresidential space percentage that HUD establishes under paragraph (d)(6)(vii) of this section, any request for such an exception and the determination of the disposition of such request may be made, at the option of the requester, under the Direct Endorsement Lender Review and Approval process or under the HUD review and approval process through the applicable field office of the Department; and

(2) In determining whether to allow such an exception, factors relating to the economy for the locality in which the project is located or specific to the project, including the total number of family units in the project, shall be considered. A DELRAP lender, in determining whether to grant a requested exception, shall follow any procedures that HUD may establish.
