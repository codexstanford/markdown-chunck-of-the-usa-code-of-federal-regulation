####### Initial occupancy.

(c)(1) Where rehabilitation is involved, sixty days prior to the completion of the rehabilitation, or when the rehabilitation is begun, whichever is later, the Owner shall determine whether the tenant population of the project generally reflects the racial/ethnic makeup of the housing market area. Based on this determination, the Owner shall then conduct appropriate marketing activities in accordance with a HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan. Such activities may include special outreach to those groups identified as not ordinarily expected to apply for these units without special outreach; notification to PHA's in the housing market area of any anticipated vacancies; and formulation of waiting lists based on the Owner's HUD-approved tenant selection factors.

(2) Where a PHA is notified, the PHA shall notify an appropriate size family (families) on its waiting list of the availability of the unit and refer the family (families) to the owner. (Since the Owner is responsible for tenant selection, the owner is not required to lease to a PHA selected family, but the owner must comply with ยง 886.321(b)(6).)
