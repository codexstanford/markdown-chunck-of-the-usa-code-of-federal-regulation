##### Discovery
###### § 26.18 Discovery.
####### General.

(a)The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures, which may commence at any time after an answer has been filed. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the hearing officer may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. To be relevant, information need not be admissible at the hearing, if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with discovery. Discovery may include:

(1) Requests for production of documents as set forth in § 26.19;

(2) Depositions as set forth in § 26.20;

(3) Written interrogatories as set forth in § 26.21; and

(4) Requests for admissions as set forth in § 26.22.
