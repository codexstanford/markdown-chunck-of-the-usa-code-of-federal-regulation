####### Investment of excess.

f.When the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days, the Authority shall notify the HBA and shall invest the excess in federally-insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD and in accordance with any recommendations made by the HBA. If the HBA wishes to participate in the investment program it should submit periodically to the Authority a list of HUD approved securities, bonds, or obligations which the HBA reecommends for investment by the Authority of the funds in the EHPAs. Interest earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each Homebuyer's EHPA in proportion to the amount in each such reserve account.

Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the Authority shall prepare a statement showing: (1) the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances; (2) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of all the Homebuyers' EHPAs, and (3) the aggregate uninvested balance of all the Homebuyers' EHPAs. This statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.
