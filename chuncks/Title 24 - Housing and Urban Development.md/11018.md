####### Debt-service vacancy payments.

(d)(1) If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner may submit a claim to receive additional housing assistance payments on a semiannual basis with respect to the vacant unit in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize the portion of the debt attributable to that unit for the period of the vacancy, whether the vacancy commenced during rent-up or after rent-up.

(2) Additional payments under this paragraph (d) for any unit shall not be for more than 12 months for any vacancy period, and shall be made only if:

(i) The unit was in decent, safe and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payments are claimed.

(ii) The Owner has taken and is continuing to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (2) and (3) or paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) and (c)(2) of this section, as appropriate.

(iii) The owner has demonstrated, in connection with the semiannual claim on a form and in accordance wih the standards prescribed by HUD with respect to the period of the vacancy, that the project is not providing the owner with revenues at least equal to the project costs incurred by the owner and that the amount of the payments requested is not in excess of the amount needed to make up the deficiency.

(iv) The owner has submitted to HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, in connection with the semiannual claim, a statement with relevant supporting evidence that there is a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time. The statement shall indicate the causes of the deficiency; the corrective steps that have been and will be taken; and the time by which it is expected that the project revenues will at least equal project costs without the additional payments provided under this paragraph.

(3) HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, may deny any claim for additional payments or suspend or terminate payments if it determines that, based on the owner's statement and other evidence, there is not a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.
