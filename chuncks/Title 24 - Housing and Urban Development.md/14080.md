(a)The PHA may provide PBV assistance only in accordance with HUD subsidy layering regulations (24 CFR 4.13) and other requirements. The subsidy layering review is intended to prevent excessive public assistance for the housing by combining (layering) housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program with other governmental housing assistance from federal, state, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or tax credits. The subsidy layering requirements are not applicable to existing housing. A further subsidy layering review is not required for housing selected as new construction or rehabilitation of housing, if HUD's designee has conducted a review, which included a review of PBV assistance, in accordance with HUD's PBV subsidy layering review guidelines.
