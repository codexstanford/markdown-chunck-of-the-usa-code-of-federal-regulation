###### ยง 3285.102 Installation of manufactured homes in flood hazard areas.
####### Pre-installation considerations.

(c)Prior to the initial installation of a new manufactured home, the installer is responsible for determining whether the manufactured home site lies wholly or partly within a special flood hazard area as shown on the LAHJ's Flood Insurance Rate Map, Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, or Flood Hazard Boundary Map, or if no LAHJ, in accordance with NFIP regulations. If so located, and before an installation method is agreed upon, the map and supporting studies adopted by the LAHJ must be used to determine the flood hazard zone and base flood elevation at the site.
