######## Net offer.

(b)(1) The net offer is calculated by subtracting from the bid price the dollar amounts for the financing and loan closing costs and the broker's sales commission, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(2) If an owner-occupant purchaser of the property requests in the bid, HUD may pay all or a portion of the financing and loan closing costs, not to exceed the percentage of the purchase price determined appropriate by the Secretary for the area. In no event will the total amount for broker's sales commission exceed 6 percent of the purchase price, except for cash bonuses offered to brokers by HUD for the sale of hard-to-sell properties. No assistance for financing and loan closing costs or for the broker's sales commission will be provided to investor purchasers.
