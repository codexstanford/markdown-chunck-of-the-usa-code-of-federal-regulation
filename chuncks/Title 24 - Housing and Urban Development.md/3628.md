(d)Construction of all manufactured housing (including manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of "reconstruction") must meet the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards codified at 24 CFR part 3280. These standards preempt State and local codes which are not identical to the Federal standards for the new construction of manufactured housing. The grantees providing HTF funds to assist manufactured housing units must comply with applicable State and local laws or codes. In the absence of such laws or codes, the installation must comply with the manufacturer's written instructions for installation of manufactured housing units. All new manufactured housing and all manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of "reconstruction" must be on a permanent foundation that meets the requirements for foundation systems as set forth in 24 CFR 203.43f(c)(i). All new manufactured housing (and all manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of "reconstruction") must, at the time of project completion, be connected to permanent utility hook-ups and be located on land that is owned by the manufactured housing unit owner or land for which the manufactured housing owner has a lease for a period at least equal to the applicable period of affordability. In HTF-funded rehabilitation of existing manufactured housing the foundation and anchoring must meet all applicable State and local codes, ordinances, and requirements or in the absence of local or State codes, the Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards at 24 CFR part 3285. Manufactured housing that is rehabilitated using HTF funds must meet the property standards requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable. The grantee must document this compliance in accordance with inspection procedures that the grantee has established pursuant to ยง 92.301, as applicable.
