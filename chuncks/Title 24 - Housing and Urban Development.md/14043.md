####### Relocation assistance for displaced person.

(a)(1) A displaced person must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

(2) The cost of required relocation assistance may be paid with funds provided by the owner, or with local public funds, or with funds available from other sources. Relocation costs may not be paid from voucher program funds; however, provided payment of relocation benefits is consistent with state and local law, PHAs may use their administrative fee reserve to pay for relocation assistance after all other program administrative expenses are satisfied. Use of the administrative fee reserve in this manner must be consistent with legal and regulatory requirements, including the requirements of 24 CFR 982.155 and other official HUD issuances.
