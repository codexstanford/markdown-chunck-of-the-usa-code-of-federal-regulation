######## Bona fide offer.

(g)A bona fide offer is an offer to purchase eligible low-income housing at a sales price which does not exceed the transfer preservation value of the project.

(1) A bona fide offer must include the following:

(i) A contract of sale signed by the purchaser, which states that acceptance of the contract is contingent upon approval by the Commissioner;

(ii) An earnest money deposit from every qualified purchaser equal to the lesser of one percent of the transfer preservation value, $50,000 or $500 per unit, unless the purchaser is a resident council purchasing the project under a resident homeownership plan under § 248.173 or § 248.175, in which case the earnest money deposit shall be equal to $200 per unit from 75% of the occupied units; and

(iii) If the purchaser is a resident council intending to purchase the project pursuant to a resident homeownership plan, the information required under § 248.173(b); or

(iv) If the purchaser is a resident council intending to retain the project as rental housing, or a community-based nonprofit and the offer is submitted within the marketing period established in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a resolution of the resident council, or a petition signed by tenants representing a majority of the units indicating their support of the offer.

(2) An owner may waive the requirement of an earnest money deposit or agree to accept a smaller deposit for all qualified purchasers, except resident councils who intend to purchase the project pursuant to a resident homeownership plan under § 248.173 or § 248.175. In order to be effective:

(i) The waiver must be indicated in the second notice of intent submitted under § 248.133 and the waiver must apply equally to all qualified purchasers, except resident councils who intend to purchase the project pursuant to a resident homeownership plan under § 248.173 or § 248.175; or

(ii) If the second notice of intent has already been submitted, the owner must submit to the Commissioner, in writing, its decision to waive the earnest money deposit. The Commissioner shall notify all qualified purchasers who have submitted an expression of interest under paragraph (e) of this section that the owner has waived the earnest money deposit requirement.
