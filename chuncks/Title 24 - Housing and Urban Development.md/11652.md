######## Continuation of housing assistance payments.

(3)(i) A family shall remain eligible for housing assistance payments until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent. The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Housing assistance payments may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent or other relevant circumstances during the term of the HAP contract, the family meets the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter and housing assistance is available for the unit under the terms of the HAP contract. The family will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

(ii) A family's eligibility for housing assistance payments may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including information related to disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State wage information collection agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.
