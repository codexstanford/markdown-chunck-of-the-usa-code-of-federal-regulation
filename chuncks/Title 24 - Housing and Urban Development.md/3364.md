###### Local account.

(c)(1) The local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund includes deposits of HOME funds disbursed from the Treasury account; the deposit of any State funds (other than HOME funds transferred pursuant to § 92.102(b)(2)) or local funds that enable the jurisdiction to meet the participating threshold amount in § 92.102, any program income (from both the allocated funds and matching contributions in accordance with the definition of program income), and any repayments or recaptured funds as required by § 92.503. The local account must be interest-bearing.

(2) The participating jurisdiction may establish a second local account of the HOME Investment Trust Funds if:

(i) The participating jurisdiction has its own affordable housing trust fund that the participating jurisdiction will use for matching contributions to the HOME program;

(ii) The statute or local ordinance requires repayments from its own trust fund to be made to the trust fund;

(iii) The participating jurisdiction establishes a separate account within its own trust fund for repayments of the matching contributions; and

(iv) The funds in the account are used solely for investment in eligible activities within the participating jurisdiction's boundaries in accordance with the provisions of this part, except as provided under § 92.201(a)(2).

(3) The funds in the local account cannot be used for the matching contribution and do not need to be matched.
