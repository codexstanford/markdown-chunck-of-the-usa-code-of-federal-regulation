######## ยง 203.379 Adjustment for damage or neglect.

(a) If the property has been damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or, for mortgages insured on or after January 1, 1977, the property has suffered damage because of the mortgagee's failure to take action as required by ยง 203.377, the damage must be repaired before conveyance of the property or assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary, except under the following conditions:

(1) If the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained, there will be deducted from the insurance benefits the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repairing the damage or any insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, whichever is greater.

(2) If the property has been damaged by fire and was not covered by fire insurance at the time of the damage, or the amount of insurance coverage was inadequate to repair fully the damage, only the amount of insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, if any, will be deducted from the insurance benefits, provided the mortgagee certifies, at the time that a claim is filed for insurance benefits, that:

(i) At the time the mortgage was insured, the property was covered by fire insurance in an amount at least equal to the lesser of 100 percent of the insurable value of the improvements, or the principal loan balance of the mortgage; and

(ii) The insurer later cancelled this coverage or refused to renew it for reasons other than nonpayment of premium; and

(iii) The mortgagee made diligent though unsuccessful efforts within 30 days of any cancellation or non-renewal of hazard insurance, and at least annually thereafter, to secure other coverage or coverage under a FAIR Plan, in an amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or if coverage to such an extent was unavailable at a reasonable rate, the greatest extent of coverage that was available at a reasonable rate; and

(iv) The extent of coverage obtained by the mortgagee in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section was the greatest available at a reasonable rate, or if the mortgagee was unable to obtain insurance, none was available at a reasonable rate; and

(v) The mortgagee took the actions required by ยง 203.377 of this part.

(3) The certification requirements set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to any mortgage insured by HUD on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has not been filed before September 30, 1986. Any mortgage insured on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has been filed before September 30, 1986, but the claim has not been settled before that date, will be governed by ยง 203.379(b) (1986) Edition as it existed immediately before September 30, 1986.
