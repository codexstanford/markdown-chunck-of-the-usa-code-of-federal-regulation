###### ยง 943.130 What are the responsibilities of participating PHAs?
####### Applicability of independent audit and performance assessment system requirements to consortia.

(b)Where the lead agency will manage substantially all program and activities of the consortium, HUD interprets financial accountability to rest with the consortium and thus HUD will apply independent audit and performance assessment requirements on a consortium-wide basis. Where the lead agency will not manage substantially all programs and activities of a consortium, the consortium shall indicate in its PHA Plan submission which PHAs have financial accountability for the programs. The determination of financial accountability shall be made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as determined in consultation with an independent public accountant. In such situations, HUD will apply independent audit and performance assessment requirements consistent with that determination. With respect to any consortium, however, HUD may determine (based on a request from the consortium or other circumstances) to apply independent audit and performance requirements on a different basis where this would promote sound management.
