###### Reductions of Fiscal Year 2015 and subsequent fiscal year allocations.

(d)(1)HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund, as follows:

(i) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not committed (including funds for community housing development organizations under ยง 92.300) within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation;

(ii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that were committed to a State recipient or subrecipient that are not committed to a specific local project within 36 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation;

(iii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not expended (drawn down) by September 30 of the fifth year after the end of the period of availability of the fiscal year allocation for obligation by HUD. Due to end-of-year financial system closeouts that begin before this date and prevent electronic access to the payment system, requests to draw down the funds must be made at least 7 full business days before this date to ensure that the funds still can be drawn from the United States Treasury account through the computerized disbursement and information system; and

(iv) Any penalties assessed by HUD under ยง 92.552.
