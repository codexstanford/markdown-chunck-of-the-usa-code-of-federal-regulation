####### Effect on assistance applicants.

(h)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section, if the processing entity determines that the assistance applicant is otherwise eligible to participate in a program, the assistance applicant may retain its place on the waiting list for the program but cannot become a participant until it can provide the documentation referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section to verify the SSN of each member of the household.

(2) For applicants to the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Program for Homeless Individuals under 24 CFR part 882, subpart H, the documentation required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be provided to the processing entity within 90 calendar days from the date of admission into the program. The processing entity shall grant an extension of one additional 90-day period if the processing entity, in its discretion, determines that the applicant's failure to comply was due to circumstances that could not have reasonably been foreseen and were outside the control of the applicant. If, upon expiration of the provided time period, the individual fails to produce a SSN, the processing entity shall follow the provisions of ยง 5.218.

(3) If a child under the age of 6 years was added to the assistance applicant household within the 6-month period prior to the household's date of admission (or, for the HCV program, the date of voucher issuance), the assistance applicant may become a participant, so long as the documentation required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is provided to the processing entity within 90 calendar days from the date of admission into the program (or, for the HCV program, the effective date of the Housing Assistance Payment contract). The processing entity must grant an extension of one additional 90-day period if the processing entity determines that, in its discretion, the assistance applicant's failure to comply was due to circumstances that could not reasonably have been foreseen and were outside the control of the assistance applicant. If the applicant family fails to produce the documentation required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section within the required time period, the processing entity must follow the provisions of ยง 5.218.
