###### functional aggregation,geographic aggregation,a combination of aggregation approaches,

(b) In deciding the most appropriate basis for aggregation when evaluating activities under more than one program, the responsible entity may choose:when a specific type of activity (e.g., water improvements) is to take place in several separate locales or jurisdictions;when a mix of dissimilar but related activities is to be concentrated in a fairly specific project area (e.g., a combination of water, sewer and street improvements and economic development activities); orwhich, for various project locations, considers the impacts arising from each functional activity and its interrelationship with other activities.

(c) The purpose of project aggregation is to group together related activities so that the responsible entity can:

(1) Address adequately and analyze, in a single environmental review, the separate and combined impacts of activities that are similar, connected and closely related, or that are dependent upon other activities and actions. (See 40 CFR 1508.25(a)).

(2) Consider reasonable alternative courses of action.

(3) Schedule the activities to resolve conflicts or mitigate the individual, combined and/or cumulative effects.

(4) Prescribe mitigation measures and safeguards including project alternatives and modifications to individual activities.
