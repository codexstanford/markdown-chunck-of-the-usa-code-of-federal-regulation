(2) For 24 CFR part 883 projects, with approval of the Agency, the owner may contract with a private or public entity (but not with the Agency unless temporarily necessary for the Agency to protect its financial interest and to uphold its program responsibilities where no alternative management agent is immediately available) for performance of the services or duties required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
