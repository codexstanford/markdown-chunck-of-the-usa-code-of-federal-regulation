(C)() The State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposes in a designated special flood hazard area in which the sale of flood insurance is available under the NFIP unless the individual or family obtains adequate flood insurance and maintains such insurance for as long as they live at that property address. The coverage shall equal the maximum grant amount established under ยง 411(f) of the Stafford Act. If the grantee is a homeowner, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the residence at the flood-damaged property address for as long as the structure exists if the grantee, or any subsequent owner of that real estate, ever wishes to be assisted by the Federal government with any subsequent flood damages or losses to real or personal property, or both. If the grantee is a renter, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the contents for as long as the renter resides at the flood-damaged property address. The restriction is lifted once the renter moves from the rental unit.
