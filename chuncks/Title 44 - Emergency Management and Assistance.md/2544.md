###### ยง 296.30 Establishing injuries and damages.
####### Burden of proof.

(a)The burden of proving injuries and damages rests with the claimant. A claimant may submit for the Administrative Record a statement explaining why the claimant believes that the injuries and damages are compensable and any documentary evidence supporting the claim. Claimants will provide documentation, which is reasonably available, including photographs and video, to corroborate the nature, extent, and value of their injuries and/or to execute affidavits in a form established by the Claims Office. FEMA may compensate a claimant for an injury in the absence of supporting documentation, in its discretion, on the strength of an affidavit or Proof of Loss executed by the claimant, if documentary evidence substantiating the injury is not reasonably available. FEMA may also require an inspection of real property. FEMA may request that a business claimant execute an affidavit, which states that the claimant will provide documentary evidence, including but not limited to income tax returns, if requested by the DHS Office of the Inspector General or the Government Accountability Office during an audit of the claim.
