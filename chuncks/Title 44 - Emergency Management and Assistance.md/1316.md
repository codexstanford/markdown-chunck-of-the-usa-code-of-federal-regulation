####### Hazard mitigation plan.

A plan to develop actions the State, local, or tribal government will take to reduce the risk to people and property from all hazards. The intent of hazard mitigation planning under the Fire Management Assistance Grant Program is to identify wildfire hazards and cost-effective mitigation alternatives that produce long-term benefits. FEMA addresses mitigation of fire hazards as part of the State's comprehensive Mitigation Plan, described in 44 CFR part 201.
