###### Emergency management.

(g)Refers to the activities and measures undertaken by a State, or one of its political subdivisions, to manage a "civil defense program" as defined and provided for by the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as amended, including without limitation Title V, added by Public Law 96-342, and section 207, added by Public Law 97-86. Title V calls for an improved civil defense program that includes:

(1) A program structure for the resources to be used for attack-related civil defense; (2) a program structure for the resources to be used for disaster-related civil defense; and (3) criteria and procedures under which those resources planned for attack-related civil defense and those planned for disaster-related civil defense can be used interchangeably. Thus, emergency management includes "civil defense" for and operations in either attack-related or disaster-related emergencies. Section 207 allows Federal Civil Defense Act funds to be used for disaster preparedness and response if such use "is consistent with, contributes to, and does not detract from attack-related civil defense preparedness." Also 44 CFR part 312, Use of Civil Defense Personnel, Materials, and Facilities for Natural Disaster Purposes, provides terms and conditions for such use.
