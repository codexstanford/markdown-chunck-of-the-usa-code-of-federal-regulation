() The State IFG program staff shall provide the NFIP with records of individuals who received an IFG award and are, therefore, to be insured. Records of IFG grantees to be insured shall be accompanied by payments to cover the premium amounts for each grantee for the 3-year policy term. The NFIP will then issue a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each grantee. Flood insurance coverage becomes effective on the 30th day following the receipt of records of GFIP insureds and their premium payments from the State, and terminates 36 months from the inception date of the GFIP, i.e., 60 days from the date of the disaster declaration.
