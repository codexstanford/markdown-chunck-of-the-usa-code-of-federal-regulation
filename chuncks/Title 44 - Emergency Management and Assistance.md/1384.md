(c)FEMA will provide no assistance to an applicant for costs attributable to applicant's own negligence. If the applicant suspects negligence by a third party for causing a condition for which FEMA made assistance available under this Part, the applicant is responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the negligence of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available to the recipient or subrecipient, and will treat them consistent with (a) of this section.
