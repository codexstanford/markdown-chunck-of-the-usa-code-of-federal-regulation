####### Property later becomes ineligible.

(2)FEMA may not renew a policy for a property that was eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application, but later became ineligible for coverage. In such instances, FEMA must nullify the policy from the first renewal date after the property became ineligible. FEMA must refund all premium, fees, and surcharges paid from the first renewal date after the property became ineligible, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the property was eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application, but later became ineligible for coverage. If FEMA paid a claim for a property after it became ineligible for coverage, the policyholder must return the claim payment to FEMA or FEMA must offset the amount of claim payment from the premiums to be refunded before FEMA may process the refund.
