(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.

(iii) Provision for manual backup for the activation of automatic systems.

(iv) Provisions for periodic inspection of interior drainage systems and periodic operation of any mechanized portions for testing and training purposes. No more than one year shall elapse between either the inspections or the operations.
