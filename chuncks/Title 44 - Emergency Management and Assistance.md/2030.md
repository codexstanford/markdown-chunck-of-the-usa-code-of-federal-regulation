####### Local government.

(a)(1) The local government must be located within the area designated by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate as eligible for assistance under a major disaster declaration. In addition, State law must not prohibit the local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federal loan.

(2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a local government for a Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and other revenues as result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions, the maintenance of an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essential municipal operating services to the community. Eligibility for other assistance under the Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.
