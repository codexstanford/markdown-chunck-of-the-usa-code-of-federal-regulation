####### Request process.

(b)The Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request such DOD assistance. The Governor should submit the request to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 48 hours of the occurrence of the incident. Requests made after that time may still be considered if information is submitted indicating why the request for assistance could not be made during the initial 48 hours. The request shall include:

(1) Information describing the types and amount of DOD emergency assistance being requested;

(2) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;

(3) A finding that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments and that Federal assistance is necessary for the preservation of life and property;

(4) A certification by the Governor that the State and local government will reimburse FEMA for the non-Federal share of the cost of such work; and

(5) An agreement:

(i) To provide all lands, easements and rights-of-way necessary to accomplish the approved work without cost to the United States;

(ii) To hold and save the United States free from damages due to the requested work, and to indemnify the Federal government against any claims arising from such work; and

(iii) To assist DOD in all support and local jurisdictional matters.
