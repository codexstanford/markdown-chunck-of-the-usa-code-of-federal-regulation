(2) Individuals or households that are located in a special flood hazard area may not receive Federal Assistance for National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)-insurable real and/or personal property, damaged by a flood, unless the community in which the property is located is participating in the NFIP (44 CFR part 59.1), or the exception in 42 U.S.C. 4105(d) applies. However, if the community in which the damaged property is located qualifies for and enters the NFIP during the six-month period following the declaration, the Governor's Authorized Representative may request a time extension for FEMA (ยง 206.112) to accept registrations and to process assistance applications in that community.
