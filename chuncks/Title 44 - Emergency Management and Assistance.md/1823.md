(d)(1) An applicant's authorized local representative is responsible for representing the applicant and for ensuring that the applicant has identified all eligible work and submitted all costs for disaster-related damages for funding.

(i) We or the applicant, assisted by the State as appropriate, will prepare a Project Worksheet (FEMA Form 90-91) for each project. The Project Worksheet must identify the eligible scope of work and must include a quantitative estimate for the eligible work.

(ii) The applicant will have 60 days following its first substantive meeting with us to identify and to report damage to us.

(2) When the estimated cost of work on a project is less than $3,000, that work is not eligible and we will not approve a Project Worksheet for the project. Such $3,000 amount shall be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor.
