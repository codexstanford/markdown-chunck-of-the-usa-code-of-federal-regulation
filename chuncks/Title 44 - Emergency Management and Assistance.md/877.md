####### Cancellation due to lack of an insurable interest.

(b)If the policyholder had an insurable interest, but no longer has an insurable interest, in the insured property, FEMA must cancel the policy on the insured property. If FEMA cancels a policy for this reason, FEMA must refund the policyholder a pro rata share of the premium from the date the policyholder lost an insurable interest in the property, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request. FEMA must pay the policyholder a refund of all fees or surcharges for any full policy term during which the policyholder had no insurable interest in the insured property, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request. A policyholder ceases to have an insurable interest if:

(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.

(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.
