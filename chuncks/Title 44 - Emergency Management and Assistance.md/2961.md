###### Determination of flat fee component.

(d)For each year of the six-year cycle, we recover the remainder of REP Program budgeted funds as a flat fee component. Specifically, we determine the flat fee component by subtracting the total of our personnel and contractor site-specific, biennial exercise-related components, as outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, from the total REP budget for that fiscal year. We then divide the resulting amount equally among the total number of licensed commercial nuclear power plant sites (defined under 354.2) to arrive at each site's flat fee component for that fiscal year.
