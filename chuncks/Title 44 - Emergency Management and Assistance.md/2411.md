####### Allowable compensation.

(a)The CGFAA provides for the payment of compensatory damages. Compensatory damages are "real, substantial and just money damages established by the Claimant in compensation for actual or real injury or loss." In general, an Injured Person will be compensated for Losses to the same extent that the plaintiff in a successful tort action brought against a private party under the laws of the State of New Mexico would be compensated. In addition the CGFAA permits FEMA to compensate Injured Parties for certain categories of "loss of property," "business loss," and "financial loss," which are enumerated in the CGFAA. Damages must be reasonable in amount. Claimants must take reasonable steps to mitigate (reduce) their damages, if possible, as required by New Mexico tort law.
