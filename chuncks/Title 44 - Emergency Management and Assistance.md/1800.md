####### Duplication when assistance under the Act is involved.

(4)If duplication is discovered, the Regional Administrator shall determine whether the duplicating agency followed its own remedial procedures.

(i) If the duplicating agency followed its procedures and was successful in correcting the duplication, the Regional Administrator will take no further action. If the agency was not successful in correcting the duplication, and the Regional Administrator is satisfied that the duplicating agency followed its remedial procedures, no further action will be taken.

(ii) If the duplicating agency did not follow its duplication of benefits procedures, or the Regional Administrator is not satisfied that the procedures were followed in an acceptable manner, then the Regional Administrator shall provide an opportunity for the agency to take the required corrective action. If the agency cannot fulfill its responsibilities for remedial action, the Regional Administrator shall notify the recipient of the excess assistance, and after examining the debt, if it is determined that the likelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the Federal Government justify taking the necessary recovery actions, then take those recovery actions in conjunction with agency representatives for each identified case in the random sample (or larger universe, at the Regional Administrator's discretion).
