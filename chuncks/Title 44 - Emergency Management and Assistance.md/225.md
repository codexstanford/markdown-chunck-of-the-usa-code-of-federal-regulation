###### Floodplain

means the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland and coastal waters including, at a minimum, that area subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Wherever in this regulation the term "floodplain" is used, if a critical action is involved, "floodplain" shall mean the area subject to inundation from a flood having a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year (500-year floodplain). "Floodplain" does not include areas subject only to mudflow until FIA adopts maps identifying "M" Zones.
