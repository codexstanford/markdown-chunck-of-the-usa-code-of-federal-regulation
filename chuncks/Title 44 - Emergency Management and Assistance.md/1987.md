####### Existing facility

(c)on a unit of CBRS established by Public Law 97-348 means a publicly owned or operated facility on which the start of a construction took place prior to October 18, 1982, and for which this fact can be adequately documented. In addition, a legally valid building permit or equivalent documentation, if required, must have been obtained for the construction prior to October 18, 1982. If a facility has been substantially improved or expanded since October 18, 1982, it is not an existing facility. For any other unit added to the CBRS by amendment to Public Law 97-348, the enactment date of such amendment is substituted for October 18, 1982, in this definition.
