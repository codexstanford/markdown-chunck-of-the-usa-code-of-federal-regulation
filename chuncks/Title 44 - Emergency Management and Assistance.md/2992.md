####### Target Allocation

is the maximum amount of FEMA earthquake program funds presumably available to an eligible State in a fiscal year. It is based primarily upon the total amount of State assistance funds available to FEMA annually, the number of eligible States, and a nationally standardized comparison of these States' seismic hazard and population-at-risk. The target allocation is not necessarily the amount of funding that a State will actually receive from FEMA. Rather, it represents a planning basis of negotiations between the State and its FEMA Regional Office which will ultimately determine the actual amount of earthquake State assistance to be provided by FEMA.
