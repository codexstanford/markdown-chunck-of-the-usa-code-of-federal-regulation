####### financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes

(A) For the purpose of this paragraph,means a grant to an individual or family to repair, replace, or rebuild the insurable portions of a home, and/or to purchase or repair insurable contents. For a discussion of what elements of a home and contents are insurable, see 44 CFR part 61, Insurance Coverage and Rates.

(B) A State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposes where the structure to which the grant assistance relates is located in a designated special flood hazard area which has been identified by the Assistant Administrator for Mitigation for at least 1 year as floodprone, unless the community in which the structure is located is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). However, if a community qualifies for and enters the NFIP during the 6-month period following the major disaster declaration, the Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR) may request a time extension (see paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section) from the Regional Administrator for the purpose of accepting and processing grant applications in that community. The Regional Administrator or Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, as appropriate, may approve the State's request if those applicable governmental disaster assistance programs which were available during the original application period are available to the grant applicants during the extended application period.
