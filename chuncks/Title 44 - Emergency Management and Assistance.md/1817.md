####### Recipient.

(m)Recipient means the government to which a grant is awarded, and which is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The recipient is the entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award document. Generally, except as provided in ยง 206.202(f), the State for which the emergency or major disaster is declared is the recipient. However, an Indian Tribal government may choose to be a recipient, or it may act as a subrecipient under the State. If an Indian Tribal government is the recipient, it will assume the responsibilities of the "recipient" or "State" as described in this part with respect to administration of the Public Assistance program.
