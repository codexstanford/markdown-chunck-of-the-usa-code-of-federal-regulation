####### Recipient.

The recipient is the government to which a grant is awarded which is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The recipient is the entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award document. Generally, the State, as designated in the FEMA-State Agreement for the Fire Management Assistance Grant Program, is the recipient. However, after a declaration, an Indian tribal government may choose to be a recipient, or it may act as a subgrantee under the State. An Indian tribal government acting as recipient will assume the responsibilities of a "state", as described in this Part, for the purpose of administering the grant.
