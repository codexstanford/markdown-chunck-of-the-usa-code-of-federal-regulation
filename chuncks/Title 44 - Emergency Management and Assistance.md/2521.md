An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, who has compensated an injured person for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries, may file a Notice of Loss under the Act for the subrogated claim. A subrogee may file a Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured Person who received payment from the subrogee filed a Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss should be filed after the subrogee has made all payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries under the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement between the subrogee and the Injured Person, but not later than November 14, 2024. By filing a Notice of Loss for any subrogated claim, the subrogee elects the Act as its exclusive remedy against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States for all subrogated claims arising out of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. Subrogation claims must be made on a Notice of Loss form furnished by the Claims Office.
