####### i.e.

(ii) The non-federal share shall be paid from funds made available by the State. If the State does not provide the non-Federal share to FEMA before FEMA begins to provide assistance to individuals and households under subsection 408(e) of the Stafford Act, FEMA will still process applications. The State will then be obliged to reimburse FEMA for the non-Federal cost share of such assistance on a monthly basis. If the State does not provide such reimbursement on a monthly basis, then FEMA will issue a Bill for Collection to the State on a monthly basis for the duration of the program. FEMA will charge interest, penalties, and administrative fees on delinquent Bills for Collection in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act. Cost shared funds, interest, penalties and fees owed to FEMA through delinquent Bills for Collections may be offset from other FEMA disaster assistance programs (Public Assistance) from which the State is receiving, or future grant awards from FEMA or other Federal Agencies. Debt Collection procedures will be followed as outlined in 44 CFR part 11.
