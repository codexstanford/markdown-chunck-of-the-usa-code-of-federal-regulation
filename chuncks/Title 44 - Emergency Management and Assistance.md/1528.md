###### ยง 206.101 Temporary housing assistance for emergencies and major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002.
####### Program intent.

(b)Assistance under this program is made available to applicants who require temporary housing as a result of a major disaster or emergency that is declared by the President. Eligibility for assistance is based on need created by disaster-related unlivability of a primary residence or other disaster-related displacement, combined with a lack of adequate insurance coverage. Eligible applicants may be paid for authorized accommodations and/or repairs. In the interest of assisting the greatest number of people in the shortest possible time, applicants who are able to do so will be encouraged to make their own arrangements for temporary housing. Although numerous instances of minor damage may cause some inconvenience to the applicant, the determining eligibility factor must be the livability of the primary residence. FEMA has also determined that it is reasonable to expect applicants or their landlords to make some repairs of a minor nature. Temporary housing will normally consist of a check to cover housing-related costs wherever possible.
