###### et seq.

(6) In addition to standards (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section, no action may be taken if it is inconsistent with the criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR part 59) or any more restrictive Federal, State or local floodplain management standards.

(7) New construction and substantial improvement of structures shall be elevated on open works (walls, columns, piers, piles, etc.) rather than on fill, in all cases in coastal high hazard areas and elsewhere, where practicable.

(8) To minimize the effect of floods on human health, safety and welfare, the Agency shall:

(i) Where appropriate, integrate all of its proposed actions in floodplains into existing flood warning and preparedness plans and ensure that available flood warning time is reflected;

(ii) Facilitate adequate access and egress to and from the site of the proposed action; and

(iii) Give special consideration to the unique hazard potential in flash flood, rapid-rise or tsunami areas.

(9) In the replacement of building contents, materials and equipment, the Regional Administrator shall require as appropriate, disaster proofing of the building and/or elimination of such future losses by relocation of those building contents, materials and equipment outside or above the base floodplain or the 500-year floodplain for critical actions.
