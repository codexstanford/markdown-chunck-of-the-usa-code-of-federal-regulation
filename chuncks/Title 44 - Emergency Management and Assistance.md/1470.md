####### Modified Federal emergency recommendation.

(d)The recommendation will be based on a report which will indicate that an emergency does or does not exist for which assistance under section 502 of the Stafford Act would be appropriate. An emergency declaration will not be recommended in situations where the authority to respond or coordinate is within the jurisdiction of one or more Federal agencies without a Presidential declaration. However, where there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude, not addressed by other assistance, which could appropriately be addressed under the Stafford Act, the involvement of other Federal agencies would not preclude a declaration of an emergency under the Act.
