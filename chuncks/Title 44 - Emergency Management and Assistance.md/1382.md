###### ยง 204.62 Duplication and recovery of assistance.
####### Duplication of benefits.

(a)FEMA provides supplementary assistance under the Stafford Act, which generally may not duplicate benefits received by or available to the applicant from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. An applicant must notify FEMA of all benefits that it receives or anticipates from other sources for the same purpose, and must seek all such benefits available to them. FEMA will reduce the grant by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source. FEMA may provide assistance under this Part when other benefits are available to an applicant, but the applicant will be liable to FEMA for any duplicative amounts that it receives or has available to it from other sources, and must repay FEMA for such amounts.
