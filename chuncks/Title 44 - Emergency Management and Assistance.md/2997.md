##### Subpart A - Earthquake Hazards Reduction Assistance Program
###### ยง 361.3 Project description.
####### Other Activities

(4)in support of those listed in ยง 361.3(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) may include, but are not limited to, State seismic advisory boards which provide State and local officials responsible for implementing earthquake hazards reduction projects with expert advice in a variety of fields; hazard identification which defines the potential for earthquakes and their related geological hazards in a particular area; and vulnerability assessments, also known as loss estimation studies, which provide information on the impacts and consequences of an earthquake on an area's resources, as well as opportunities for earthquake hazards mitigation.

(c) State eligibility for financial assistance to States under this section is determined by FEMA based on a combination of the following criteria:

(1) Seismic hazard, including the historic occurrence of damaging earthquakes, as well as probable seismic activity;

(2) Total population and major urban concentrations exposed to such risk; and

(3) Other factors, the loss, damage, or disruption of which by a severe earthquake would have serious national impacts upon national security, such as industrial concentrations, concentrations or occurrences of natural resources, financial/economic centers and national defense facilities.

(d) Each fiscal year, FEMA will establish a target allocation of earthquake program funds for each eligible State.

(e) The specific activities, and the distribution of funds among them, that will be undertaken with this assistance will be determined during the annual Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement (CCA) negotiations between FEMA and the State, and will be based upon the following:

(1) The availability of information regarding identification of seismic hazards and vulnerability to those hazards;

(2) Earthquake hazards reduction accomplishments of the State to date;

(3) State and Federal priorities for needed earthquake hazards reduction activities; and

(4) State and local capabilities with respect to staffing, professional expertise, and funding.

(f) As a condition of receiving FEMA funding, a percentage of the amount of the total State project (FEMA State assistance, combined with the State match) must be spent for activities under the Mitigation Planning element. The percentage, to be determined by FEMA, may be increased by no more than 5 percent annually, beginning at 15 percent in fiscal year 1991 with a limit of 50 percent of the total State project. The increase will take into account the amount of time a State has been participating in the program. States may expend more than the required percentage of funding on eligible mitigation activities.

(g) The State match may be distributed among the eligible activities in any manner that is mutually agreed upon by FEMA and the State in the CCA negotiations.

(h) Negotiations between FEMA and the State regarding the scope of work and the determination of the amount of State assistance to be awarded shall consider earthquake hazards reduction activities previously accomplished by the State, as well as the quality of their performance.
