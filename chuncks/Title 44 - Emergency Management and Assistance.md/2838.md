###### Stage 2, Crisis Management.

(b)During the crisis management stage, GMR plans are reviewed and capabilities will be re-examined in light of an actual event or crisis perceived to be emerging.

(1) Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional data on selected resources or increase their preparedness activities. Costed Option Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for the response option measures in each of the department's and agency's area of responsibility. For example, when it appears likely that increased national resources may be required, resource readiness could be improved through the procurement of essential long lead time items, especially those that can be used even if the situation does not escalate. In general, long lead time preparedness actions would be considered for implementation at this time.

(2) Many preparedness actions at this stage would be handled through reprogramming, but the Costed Option Packages may also require new funding.

(3) If the crisis worsens, and prior to the declaration of national emergency, it may be necessary to surge certain production and stockpile items for future use.
