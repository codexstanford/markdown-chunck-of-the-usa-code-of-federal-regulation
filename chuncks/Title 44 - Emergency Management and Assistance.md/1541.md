####### Applications,Application period.

(e)-(1)The standard FEMA application period is the 60 days following the date the President declares an incident a major disaster or an emergency. The Regional Administrator may, however, extend the application period, when we anticipate that we need more time to collect applications from the affected population or to establish the same application deadline for contiguous Counties or States. After the application period has ended, FEMA will accept and process applications for an additional 60 days only from persons who can provide an acceptable explanation (and documentation to substantiate their explanation) for why they were not able to contact FEMA before the application period ended.
