###### ยง 11.73 Allowable claims.

(a) A claim may be allowed only if: (1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, his/her agent, the members of his/her family, or his/her private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances); and (2) the possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and (3) the claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.

(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this subpart shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.

(c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section, and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with FEMA may be considered and allowed. The following are examples of the principal types of claims which may be allowed, unless excluded by ยง 11.74.
