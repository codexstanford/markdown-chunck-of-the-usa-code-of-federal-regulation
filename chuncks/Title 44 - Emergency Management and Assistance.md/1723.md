###### ยง 206.131 Individual and Family Grant Program for major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002.
####### Purpose.

(b)The grant program is intended to provide funds to individuals or families to permit them to meet those disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs for which assistance from other means is either unavailable or inadequate. Meeting those expenses and needs as expeditiously as possible will require States to make an early commitment of personnel and resources. States may make grants in instances where the applicant has not received other benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time of application to the IFG program, and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicated assistance to the State. The grant program is not intended to indemnify disaster losses or to permit purchase of items or services which may generally be characterized as nonessential, luxury, or decorative. Assistance under this program is not to be counted as income or a resource in the determination of eligibility for welfare or other income-tested programs supported by the Federal Government, in that IFG assistance is intended to address only disaster-related needs.
