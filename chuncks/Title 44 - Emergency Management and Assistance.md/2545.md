####### Proof of Loss.

(b)All claimants are required to attest to the nature and extent of each injury for which compensation is sought in the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss, which will be in a form specified by the Claims Office, must be signed by the claimant or the claimant's legal representative if the claimant is not an individual or is an individual who lacks the legal capacity to execute the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss must be signed under penalty of perjury. Non-subrogation claimants should submit a signed Proof of Loss to the Claims Office not later than 150 days after the date when the Notice of Loss was submitted. This deadline may be extended at the discretion of the Director of the Claims Office for good cause. If a non-subrogation claimant fails to submit a signed Proof of Loss within the timeframes set forth in this section and does not obtain an extension from the Director of the Claims Office, the Claims Office may administratively close the claim and require the claimant to repay any partial payments made on the claim. Subrogation claimants will submit the Proof of Loss contemporaneously with filing the Notice of Loss.
