###### Personnel expenses.

(q)Necessary and essential civil defense expenses for personnel on the approved staffing pattern of a grantee or subgrantee (including but not necessarily limited to salaries, wages, and supplementary compensation and fringe benefits) for such employees appointed in accordance with State and local government laws and regulations under a system which meets Federal merit system and other applicable Federal requirements. Such expenses must be supported by job descriptions, payrolls, time distribution records, and other documentation as detailed in CPG 1-3. Personnel compensation and other costs incurred with regard to employees who are not on the civil defense staff but whose work serves the civil defense agency (e.g., State's budget and accounting office) may be charged as civil defense expense to the extent covered therefore in a federally approved indirect cost allocation plan.
