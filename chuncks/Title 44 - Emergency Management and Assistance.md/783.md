###### Flood in Progress.

B.If this policy became effective as of the time of a loan closing, as provided by 44 CFR 61.11(b), we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed prior to coverage becoming effective. In all other circumstances, we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed on or before the day you submitted the application for coverage under this policy and the full amount due. We will determine the date of application using 44 CFR 61.11(f).

C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:

1. Earthquake;

2. Landslide;

3. Land subsidence;

4. Sinkholes;

5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land area; or

6. Gradual erosion.
