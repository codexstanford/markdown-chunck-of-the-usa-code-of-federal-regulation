## Chapter I - Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of Homeland Security
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 9 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION OF WETLANDS
##### ยง 9.5 Scope.
###### Limited exemption of ongoing actions involving wetlands located outside the floodplains.

(b)(1) Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, contains a limited exemption not found in Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management. Therefore, this exemption applies only to actions affecting wetlands which are located outside the floodplains, and which have no potential to result in harm to or within floodplains or to support floodplain development.

(2) The following proposed actions that impact wetlands located outside of floodplains are exempt from this regulation:

(i) Agency-assisted or permitted projects which were under construction before May 24, 1977; and

(ii) Projects for which the Agency has proposed a draft of a final environmental impact statement (EIS) which adequately analyzes the action and which was filed before October 1, 1977. Proposed actions that impact wetlands outside of floodplains are not exempt if the EIS:

(A) Only generally covers the proposed action;

(B) Is devoted largely to related activities; or

(C) Treats the project area or program without an adequate and specific analysis of the floodplain and wetland implications of the proposed action.
