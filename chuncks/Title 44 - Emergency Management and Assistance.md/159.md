The purpose of this regulation is to set out FEMA's policies and procedures under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and the general governmentwide regulations, 45 CFR part 90. The Act and the general regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act and the general regulations permit federally-assisted programs or activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.
