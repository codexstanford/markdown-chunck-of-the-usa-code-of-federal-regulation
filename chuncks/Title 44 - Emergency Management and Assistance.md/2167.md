###### Grantee(alternatively, Recipient)

for purposes of this part means the government to which a Public Assistance (PA) or Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) grant is awarded that is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award document. Generally, the State is the grantee. However, after a declaration, an Indian tribal government may choose to be a grantee, or may act as a subgrantee under the State for purposes of administering a grant under PA, HMGP, or both. When an Indian tribal government has chosen to act as grantee, it will also assume the responsibilities of a "grantee" under this part for the purposes of administering management cost funding.
