####### Term of loan.

(e)The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may consider requests for an extensions of loans based on the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan under section 417(a) normally may not exceed 10 years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the Community Disaster Loan recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment. (See ยง 206.367(c).)
