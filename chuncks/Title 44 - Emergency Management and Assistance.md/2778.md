### Subchapter F - Preparedness
#### PART 333 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES AND ALLOCATIONS SYSTEM
##### Subpart D - Priorities and Placement of Rated Orders
###### ยง 333.14 Preferential scheduling.
####### Examples:

(1)If a person receives a DO rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX rated order. However, if business operations cannot be altered to meet both the June 3 and July 15 delivery dates, then the DX rated order must be given priority over the DO rated order.

(2) [Reserved]
