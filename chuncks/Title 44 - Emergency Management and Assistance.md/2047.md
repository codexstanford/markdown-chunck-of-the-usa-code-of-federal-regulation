(d)If no funds have been disbursed from the Treasury, and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds, the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through the State and Regional Office to FEMA. However, since only one loan may be approved, cancellation precludes submission of a second loan application request by the same local government for the same disaster.
