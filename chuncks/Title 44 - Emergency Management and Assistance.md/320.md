####### Money.

(5)Claims for money in an amount that is determined to be reasonable for the claimant to possess at the time of the loss are payable:

(i) Where personal funds were accepted by responsible Government personnel with apparent authority to receive them for safekeeping, deposit, transmittal, or other authorized disposition, but were neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned;

(ii) When lost incident to a marine or aircraft disaster;

(iii) When lost by fire, flood, hurricane, or other natural disaster;

(iv) When stolen from the quarters of the claimant where it is conclusively shown that the money was in a locked container and that the quarters themselves were locked. Exceptions to the foregoing "double lock" rule are permitted when the adjudicating authority determines that the theft loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, their agent, or their employee. The adjudicating authority should use the test of whether the claimant did their best under the circumstances to protect the property; or

(v) When taken by force from the claimant's person.
