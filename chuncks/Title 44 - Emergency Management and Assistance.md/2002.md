####### Location determination.

(a)For each disaster assistance action which is proposed on the Atlantic or Gulf Coasts, the Regional Administrator shall:

(1) Review a proposed action's location to determine if the action is on or connected to the CBRS unit and thereby subject to these regulations. The appropriate Department of Interior map identifying units of the CBRS will be the basis of such determination. The CBRS units are also identified on FEMA Flood Insurance Maps (FIRM's) for the convenience of field personnel.

(2) If an action is determined not to be on or connected to a unit of the CBRS, no further requirements of these regulations needs to be met, and the action may be processed under other applicable disaster assistance regulations.

(3) If an action is determined to be on or connected to a unit of the CBRS, it is subject to the consultation and consistency requirements of CBRA as prescribed in §§ 206.348 and 206.349.
