####### Modified declaration for Federal emergencies.

(d)The requirement for a Governor's request under paragraph (a) of this section can be waived when an emergency exists for which the primary responsibility rests in the Federal government because the emergency involves a subject area for which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the Federal government exercises exclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority. Any party may bring the existence of such a situation to the attention of the FEMA Regional Administrator. Any recommendation for a Presidential declaration of emergency in the absence of a Governor's request must be initiated by the Regional Administrator or transmitted through the Regional Administrator by another Federal agency. In determining that such an emergency exists, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or Regional Administrator shall consult the Governor of the affected State, if practicable.
