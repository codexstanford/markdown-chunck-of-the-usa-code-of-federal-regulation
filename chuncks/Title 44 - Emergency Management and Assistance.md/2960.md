###### Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for FEMA contract personnel.

(c)We have determined an average biennial exercise-related cost for REP contractors for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average costs of contract personnel in REP site-specific exercise-related activities since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We will continue to track and monitor activity during the initial six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004, and we will make appropriate adjustments to this component for calculation of user fee assessments during subsequent six-year cycles.
