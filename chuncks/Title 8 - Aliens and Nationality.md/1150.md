###### Alien applying to consular officer for nonimmigrant visa or nonresident alien border crossing card.

(b)(1) An alien who is applying to a consular officer for a nonimmigrant visa or a nonresident alien border crossing card, must request permission to reapply for admission to the United States if five years, or twenty years if the alien's deportation was based upon a conviction for an aggravated felony, have not elapsed since the date of deportation or removal. This permission shall be requested in the manner prescribed through the consular officer, and may be granted only in accordance with sections 212(a)(9)(A) and 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.4. However, the alien may apply for such permission by submitting an application on the form designated by USCIS with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR 106.2, in accordance with the form instructions, to the consular officer if that officer is willing to accept the application, and recommends to the district director that the alien be permitted to apply.

(2) The consular officer shall forward the application to the district director with jurisdiction over the place where the deportation or removal proceedings were held.
