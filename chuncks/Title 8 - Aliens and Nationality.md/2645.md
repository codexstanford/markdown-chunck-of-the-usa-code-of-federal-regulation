###### Informal de facto reciprocal arrangements.

(ii)For purposes of this section, an informal de facto reciprocal arrangement exists when the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Foreign Military Rights Affairs (OSD/FMRA), certifies, with State Department concurrence, that a NATO Member State allows appropriate employment in the local economy for dependents of members of the force and members of the civilian component of the United States assigned to duty in the NATO Member State. OSD/FMRA and State's FLO shall maintain a listing of countries with which such reciprocity exists. Dependents of a NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may be authorized to accept, or continue in, employment based upon informal de facto arrangements upon favorable recommendation by SACLANT, pursuant to paragraph (s)(5) of this section, and issuance of employment authorization by the Service in accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. Additionally, the application procedures set forth in paragraph (s)(5) of this section must be complied with, and the following conditions must be met:

(A) Both the principal alien and the dependent requesting employment are maintaining NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 status, as appropriate;

(B) The principal alien's total length of assignment in the United States is expected to last more than 6 months;

(C) Employment of a similar nature for dependents of members of the force and members of the civilian component of the United States assigned to official duty in the NATO Member State employing the principal alien is not prohibited by the NATO Member State;

(D) The proposed employment is not in an occupation listed in the Department of Labor's Schedule B (20 CFR part 656), or otherwise determined by the Department of Labor to be one for which there is an oversupply of qualified United States workers in the area of proposed employment. This Schedule B restriction does not apply to a dependent son or daughter who is a full-time student if the employment is part-time, consisting of not more than 20 hours per week, of if it is temporary employment of not more than 12 weeks during school holiday periods; and

(E) The proposed employment is not contrary to the interest of the United States. Employment contrary to the interest of the United States includes, but is not limited to, the employment of NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 dependents who have criminal records; who have violated United States immigration laws or regulations, or visa laws or regulations; who have worked illegally in the United States; or who cannot establish that they have paid taxes and social security on income from current or previous United States employment.

(iii) State's FLO shall inform the Service, by contacting Headquarters, Adjudications, Attention: Chief, Business and Trade Services Branch, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536, of any additions or changes to the formal bilateral employment agreements and informal de facto reciprocal arrangements.
