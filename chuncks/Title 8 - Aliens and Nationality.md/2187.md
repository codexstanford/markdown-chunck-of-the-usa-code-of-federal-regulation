###### Change of employers and portability for H-2B workers (January 28, 2022 through July 27, 2022).

(27)(i) This paragraph (h)(27) relates to H-2B workers seeking to change employers during the time period specified in paragraph (h)(27)(iv) of this section. Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2)(i)(D) of this section:

(A) An alien in valid H-2B nonimmigrant status whose new petitioner files a non-frivolous H-2B petition requesting an extension of the alien's stay on or after January 28, 2022, is authorized to begin employment with the new petitioner after the petition described in this paragraph (h)(27) is received by USCIS and before the new H-2B petition is approved, but no earlier than the start date indicated in the new H-2B petition; or

(B) An alien whose new petitioner filed a non-frivolous H-2B petition requesting an extension of the alien's stay before January 28, 2022 that remains pending on January 28, 2022, is authorized to begin employment with the new petitioner before the new H-2B petition is approved, but no earlier than the start date of employment indicated on the new H-2B petition.

(ii)(A) With respect to a new petition described in paragraph (h)(27)(i)(A) of this section, and subject to the requirements of 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(30), the new period of employment described in paragraph (h)(27)(i) of this section may last for up to 60 days beginning on the Received Date on Form I-797 (Notice of Action) or, if the start date of employment occurs after the I-797 Received Date, for a period of up to 60 days beginning on the start date of employment indicated in the H-2B petition.

(B) With respect to a new petition described in paragraph (h)(27)(i)(B) of this section, the new period of employment described in paragraph (h)(27)(i) of this section may last for up to 60 days beginning on the later of either January 28, 2022 or the start date of employment indicated in the H-2B petition.

(C) With respect to either type of new petition, if USCIS adjudicates the new petition before the expiration of this 60-day period and denies the petition, or if the new petition is withdrawn by the petitioner before the expiration of the 60-day period, the employment authorization associated with the filing of that petition under 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(30) will automatically terminate 15 days after the date of the denial decision or 15 days after the date on which the new petition is withdrawn. Nothing in this paragraph (h)(27) is intended to alter the availability of employment authorization related to professional H-2B athletes who are traded between organizations pursuant to paragraph (h)(6)(vii) of this section and 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(9).

(iii) In addition to meeting all other requirements in paragraph (h)(6) of this section for the H-2B classification, to commence employment and be approved under this paragraph (h)(27), the alien must either:

(A) Have been in valid H-2B nonimmigrant status on or after January 28, 2022 and be the beneficiary of a non-frivolous H-2B petition requesting an extension of the alien's stay that is received on or after January 28, 2022, but no later than July 27, 2022; or

(B) Be the beneficiary of a non-frivolous H-2B petition requesting an extension of the alien's stay that is pending as of January 28, 2022.

(C) The petitioner must comply with all Federal, State, and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, where applicable, health and safety laws, laws related to COVID-19 worker protections, any right to time off or paid time off for COVID-19 vaccination, or to reimbursement for travel to and from the nearest available vaccination site; and

(D) The petitioner may not impede, interfere, or refuse to cooperate with an employee of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor who is exercising or attempting to exercise DOL's audit or investigative authority under 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, and 29 CFR 503.25.

(iv) Authorization to initiate employment changes pursuant to this paragraph (h)(27) begins at 12 a.m. on January 28, 2022, and ends at the end of July 27, 2022.
