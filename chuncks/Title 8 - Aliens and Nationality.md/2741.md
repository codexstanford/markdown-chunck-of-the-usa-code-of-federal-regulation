(12)USCIS will consider all the evidence submitted and such other evidence required in the form instructions to adjudicate the petition. USCIS will notify the petitioner of the approval of the petition on Form I-797, Notice of Action, or in another form as USCIS may prescribe.

(i) The approval notice will include the CW-1 classification and name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries and the petition's period of validity. A petition for more than one beneficiary may be approved in whole or in part.

(ii) The application for a TLC may not be filed with DOL earlier than 120 days before the date of actual need for the beneficiary's services for an initial petition for CW-1 status, or 180 days before the date of expiration of CW-1 status in the case of an extension petition described in paragraph (w)(18) of this section. The petition may then be filed with USCIS after the TLC is approved. If DOL debars an employer from obtaining a CW-1 TLC, USCIS may not approve future petitions during the debarment period.
