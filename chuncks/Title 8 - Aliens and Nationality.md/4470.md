###### Inspection of facility.

(b)Based upon a written request by the owners or operators, the INS district director or his designee shall inspect the facility or method utilized in order to ensure that owners and operators have acted diligently in taking adequate steps to prevent the unlawful entry of aliens into the United States. Such measures may include but are not necessarily limited to fencing, barricades, lighting, or security guards. If the district director determines that preventive measures are inadequate, he or she shall advise the owners or operators in writing, citing the reasons for such determination. If the owners or operators believe the requirements of the district director to be excessive or unnecessary, they may request that the Regional Commissioner having jurisdiction over the location where the facility is located, review the district director's requirements. The Regional Commissioner shall advise the owners or operators in writing of the results of his or her review.
