#### PART 241 - APPREHENSION AND DETENTION OF ALIENS ORDERED REMOVED
##### Subpart A - Post-hearing Detention and Removal
###### ยง 241.13 Determination of whether there is a significant likelihood of removing a detained alien in the reasonably foreseeable future.
####### Factors for consideration.

(f)The HQPDU shall consider all the facts of the case including, but not limited to, the history of the alien's efforts to comply with the order of removal, the history of the Service's efforts to remove aliens to the country in question or to third countries, including the ongoing nature of the Service's efforts to remove this alien and the alien's assistance with those efforts, the reasonably foreseeable results of those efforts, and the views of the Department of State regarding the prospects for removal of aliens to the country or countries in question. Where the Service is continuing its efforts to remove the alien, there is no presumptive period of time within which the alien's removal must be accomplished, but the prospects for the timeliness of removal must be reasonable under the circumstances.
