###### Evidence.

(3)An applicant must submit evidence that demonstrates he or she would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm if removed from the United States. An applicant is encouraged to describe and document all factors that may be relevant to the case, as there is no guarantee that a particular reason(s) will satisfy the requirement. Hardship to persons other than the alien victim cannot be considered in determining whether an applicant would suffer the requisite hardship. The applicant may satisfy this requirement by submitting any credible evidence regarding the nature and scope of the hardship if the applicant was removed from the United States, including evidence of hardship arising from circumstances surrounding the victimization and any other circumstances. An applicant may submit a personal statement or other evidence, including evidence from relevant country condition reports and any other public or private sources of information.
