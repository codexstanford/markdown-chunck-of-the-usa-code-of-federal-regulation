###### Evidence demonstrating a present danger of retaliation.

(6)An alien seeking derivative T nonimmigrant status on the basis of facing a present danger of retaliation as a result of the T-1 victim's escape from a severe form of trafficking or cooperation with law enforcement, must demonstrate the basis of this danger. USCIS may contact the LEA involved, if appropriate. An applicant may satisfy this requirement by submitting:

(i) Documentation of a previous grant of advance parole to an eligible family member;

(ii) A signed statement from a law enforcement official describing the danger of retaliation;

(iii) An affirmative statement from the applicant describing the danger the family member faces and how the danger is linked to the victim's escape or cooperation with law enforcement (ordinarily an applicant's statement alone is not sufficient to prove present danger); and/or

(iv) Any other credible evidence, including trial transcripts, court documents, police reports, news articles, copies of reimbursement forms for travel to and from court, and affidavits from other witnesses.
