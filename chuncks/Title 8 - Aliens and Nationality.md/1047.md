###### Conditions of admission.

(iii)Aliens who present a preliminary application shall be admitted to the United States for a period of ninety (90) days with authorization to accept employment, if they are determined by an immigration officer to be admissible to the United States. Such aliens are required, within that ninety-day period, to submit evidence of eligibility which meets the provisions of ยง 210.3 of this part; to complete Form FD-258 (Fingerprint Card); to obtain a report of medical examination in accordance with ยง 210.2(d) of this part; and to submit to a legalization office a complete application as defined at ยง 210.1(c) of this part. The INS may, for good cause, extend the ninety-day period and grant further authorization to accept employment in the United States if an alien demonstrates he or she was unable to perfect an application within the initial period. If an alien described in this paragraph fails to submit a complete application to a legalization office within ninety days or within such additional period as may have been authorized, his or her application may be denied for lack of prosecution, without prejudice.

(iv) Deportation is not stayed for an alien subject to deportation and removal under the INA, notwithstanding a claim to eligibility for SAW status, unless that alien has filed a nonfrivolous application.
