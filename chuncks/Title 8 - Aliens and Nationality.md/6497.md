###### Denial and review of decision.

(m)(1) If the director denies the application for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 202 of Public Law 105-100, the director shall notify the applicant of the decision. The director shall also:

(i) In the case of an alien who is not maintaining valid nonimmigrant status and who had not previously been placed in exclusion, deportation or removal proceedings, initiate removal proceedings in accordance with ยง 1239.1 of this chapter during which the alien may renew his or her application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100; or

(ii) In the case of an alien whose previously initiated exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings had been administratively closed or continued indefinitely under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, advise the Immigration Court that had administratively closed the proceedings, or the Board, as appropriate, of the denial of the application. Upon a motion to recalendar filed by the Service, the Immigration Court or the Board will then recalendar or reinstate the prior exclusion, deportation or removal proceedings, during which the alien may renew his or her application for adjustment under section 202 of Public Law 105-100; or

(iii) In the case of an alien who is the subject of an outstanding final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, refer the decision to deny the application by filing a Form I-290C, Notice of Certification, with the Immigration Court that issued the final order for consideration in accordance with paragraph (n) of this section.

(2) Aliens who were denied adjustment of status by the director, but who are now eligible for such adjustment of status pursuant to section 1505(a)(1) of the LIFE Act and amendments, and have not been referred to immigration proceedings as specified in paragraph (m)(1) of this section may file a motion to reopen with the Service. If an alien has been referred to the Immigration Court or has filed an appeal with the Board after an Immigration Court has denied the application for adjustment under NACARA section 202, and proceedings are pending, then the application for adjustment of status will be adjudicated in accordance with section 1505(a) of the LIFE Act and its amendments. An alien present in the United States subject to a final order of removal after his or her application was denied by an Immigration Court or the Board, but who was made eligible for adjustment pursuant to section 1505(a) of the LIFE Act and its amendments may file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court or the Board, whichever had jurisdiction last. Pursuant to section 1505(a)(2) of the LIFE Act and its amendments, motions to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Court or the Board must be filed on or before June 19, 2001.
