##### ยง 214.13 SEVIS fee for certain F, J, and M nonimmigrants.
###### Failure to pay the fee.

(h)The failure to pay the required fee is grounds for denial of F, M, or J nonimmigrant status or status-related benefits. Payment of the fee does not preserve the lawful status of any F, J, or M nonimmigrant that has violated his or her status in some other manner.

(1) For purposes of reinstatement to F or M status, failure to pay the required fee will be considered a "willful violation" under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(16) or (m)(16), unless DHS determines that there are sufficient extenuating circumstances (as determined at the discretion of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program).

(2) For purposes of reinstatement to valid J program status, failure to pay the required fee will not be considered a "minor or technical infraction" under 22 CFR 62.45.
