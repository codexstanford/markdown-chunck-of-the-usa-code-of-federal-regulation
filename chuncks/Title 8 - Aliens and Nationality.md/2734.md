(C)If the CNMI allows an individual to fully practice the occupation that usually requires a license without a license under the supervision of licensed senior or supervisory personnel in that occupation, USCIS may grant CW-1 status at its discretion after considering the duties performed, the degree of supervision received, and any limitations placed on the alien if the facts demonstrate that the alien under supervision could fully perform the duties of the occupation.

(iv) For any petition requesting an employment start date on or after October 1, 2019, including both new petitions and petitions for renewal of an existing permit, a TLC approved by DOL, confirming that there are not sufficient United States workers in the CNMI who are able, willing, qualified, and available at the time and place needed to perform the services or labor involved in the petition, and that the employment of the CW-1 nonimmigrant will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed United States workers. If the TLC accepts certain education, training, experience, or special requirements of the beneficiary, the petition must also be accompanied by documentation that the CW-1 nonimmigrant worker qualifies for the job offer as specified in the TLC.
