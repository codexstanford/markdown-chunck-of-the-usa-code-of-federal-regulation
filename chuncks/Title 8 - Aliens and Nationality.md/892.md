###### ยง 208.9 Procedure for interview before an asylum officer.
####### Dependents of applicants being considered under ยง 208.2(a)(1)(ii).

(i)This paragraph (i) governs when an applicant whose application for asylum is being considered under ยง 208.2(a)(1)(ii) is not granted asylum pursuant to ยง 208.14(c) and has included a spouse or children within their request for asylum. The asylum officer will make a determination whether there is a significant possibility that the spouse or child has experienced or fears harm that would be an independent basis for asylum, withholding of removal under the Act, or protection under the Convention Against Torture, based on the information elicited pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. This determination will be included in the record, as otherwise described in paragraph (f) of this section. Referral of the principal applicant's application to an immigration judge, along with the appropriate charging documents, will not be made until any pending application by the spouse or child as a principal applicant is adjudicated.
