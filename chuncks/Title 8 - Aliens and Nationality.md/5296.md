###### ยง 1003.17 Entry of appearance.
####### Effect of Filing Form EOIR-61.

(2)A practitioner who enters a limited appearance using Form EOIR-61 is not the practitioner of record, is not required to appear on behalf of respondent before the immigration court, and is not required to submit a motion to withdraw or substitute. The submission of a Form EOIR-61 does not create additional ongoing obligations between the practitioner, the respondent, and EOIR. An appearance through Form EOIR-61 does not provide the practitioner with access to the record of proceedings. A respondent who received assistance pursuant to this paragraph is not represented, remains pro se, and is subject to service of process of all documents filed in the proceedings, consistent with 8 CFR 1292.5.
