####### Detention of stowaways ordered removed.

(2)If detention of the stowaway is required pending removal on other than the vessel or aircraft of arrival, or if the stowaway is to be removed on the vessel or aircraft of arrival but departure of the vessel or aircraft is not imminent and circumstances preclude keeping the stowaway on board the vessel or aircraft, the Service shall take the stowaway into Service custody. The owner is responsible for all costs of maintaining and detaining the stowaway pending removal, including costs for stowaways seeking asylum as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Such costs will be limited to those normally incurred in the detention of an alien by the Service, including, but not limited to, housing, food, transportation, medical expenses, and other reasonable costs incident to the detention of the stowaway. The Service may require the posting of a bond or other surety to ensure payment of costs of detention.
