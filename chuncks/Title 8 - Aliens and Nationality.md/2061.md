(iii)-(A)-()Except as provided in paragraph (h)(8)(iv) of this section, before a petitioner can file an H-1B cap-subject petition for a beneficiary who may be counted under section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act ("H-1B regular cap") or eligible for exemption under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act ("H-1B advanced degree exemption"), the petitioner must register to file a petition on behalf of an alien beneficiary electronically through the USCIS website (). To be eligible to file a petition for a beneficiary who may be counted against the H-1B regular cap or the H-1B advanced degree exemption for a particular fiscal year, a registration must be properly submitted in accordance with 8 CFR 103.2(a)(1), paragraph (h)(8)(iii) of this section and the form instructions. A petitioner may file an H-1B cap-subject petition on behalf of a registered beneficiary only after the petitioner's registration for that beneficiary has been selected for that fiscal year. USCIS will notify the petitioner of the selection of the petitioner's registered beneficiaries.
