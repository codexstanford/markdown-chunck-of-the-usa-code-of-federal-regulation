###### ยง 103.17 Biometric services fee.

DHS may charge a fee to collect biometric information, to provide biometric collection services, to conduct required national security and criminal history background checks, to verify an individual's identity, and to store and maintain this biometric information for reuse to support other benefit requests. If a benefit request as defined in 8 CFR 1.2 must be submitted with a biometric services fee, 8 CFR part 106 will contain the requirement. When a biometric services fee is required, a benefit request submitted without the correct biometric services fee may be rejected.
