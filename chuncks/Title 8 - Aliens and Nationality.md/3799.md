###### Evidence to establish eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption.

(v)Section 204(g) of the Act provides that certain visa petitions based upon marriages entered into during deportation, exclusion or related judicial proceedings may be approved only if the petitioner provides clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is bona fide. Evidence that a visa petition based upon the same marriage was approved under the bona fide marriage exemption to section 204(g) of the Act will be considered primary evidence of eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption provided in this part. The applicant will not be required to submit additional evidence to qualify for the bona fide marriage exemption provided in this part, unless the district director determines that such additional evidence is needed. In cases where the district director notifies the applicant that additional evidence is required, the applicant must submit documentary evidence which clearly and convincingly establishes that the marriage was entered into in good faith and not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien's entry as an immigrant. Such evidence may include:

(A) Documentation showing joint ownership of property;

(B) Lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;

(C) Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;

(D) Birth certificates of children born to the applicant and his or her spouse;

(E) Affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship, or

(F) Other documentation establishing that the marriage was not entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of the United States.
