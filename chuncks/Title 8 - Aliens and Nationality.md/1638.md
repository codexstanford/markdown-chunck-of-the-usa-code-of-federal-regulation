###### Report date and program completion date on Form I-20 or successor form.

(ii)When determining the report date on the Form I-20 or successor form, the DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. However, for purposes of employment, the DSO may not indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. When determining the program completion date on Form I-20 or successor form, the DSO should make a reasonable estimate based upon the time an average student would need to complete a similar program in the same discipline.
