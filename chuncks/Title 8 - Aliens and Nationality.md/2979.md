###### Eligible family members with final orders of removal, deportation, or exclusion.

(ii)If an eligible family member is the subject of a final order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, the principal alien may file an application for derivative T nonimmigrant status directly with USCIS. The filing of an application for derivative T nonimmigrant status has no effect on ICE's authority or discretion to execute a final order, although the alien may file a request for an administrative stay of removal pursuant to 8 CFR 241.6(a). If the eligible family member is in detention pending execution of the final order, the period of detention (under the standards of 8 CFR 241.4) will be extended while a stay is in effect for the period reasonably necessary to bring about the applicant's removal.
