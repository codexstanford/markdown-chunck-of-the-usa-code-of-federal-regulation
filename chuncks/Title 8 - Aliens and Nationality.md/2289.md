(i) An L-1 petition filed on behalf of the alien,

(ii) A request to extend an L-1 petition which had previously been filed on behalf of the alien;

(iii) An application for admission as an L-1 nonimmigrant by the alien, or as an L-2 nonimmigrant by the spouse or child of such alien;

(iv) An application for change of status to H-1 or L-2 nonimmigrant filed by the alien, or to H-1, H-4, or L-1 status filed by the L-2 spouse or child of such alien;

(v) An application for change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant filed by the L-1 nonimmigrant, if his or her spouse has been approved for classification as an H-1; or

(vi) An application for extension of stay filed by the alien, or by the L-2 spouse or child of such alien.
