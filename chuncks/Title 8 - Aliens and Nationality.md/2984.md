###### Age-out protection for eligible family members of a principal alien under 21 years of age.

(ii)If the T-1 principal alien was under 21 years of age when he or she filed for T-1 nonimmigrant status, USCIS will continue to consider a parent or unmarried sibling as an eligible family member. A parent or unmarried sibling will remain eligible even if the principal alien turns 21 years of age before adjudication of the T-1 application. An unmarried sibling will remain eligible even if the unmarried sibling is over 18 years of age at the time of adjudication of the T-1 application, so long as the unmarried sibling was under 18 years of age at the time of the T-1 application. The age of an unmarried sibling when USCIS adjudicates the T-1 application, when the unmarried sibling files the derivative application, when USCIS adjudicates the derivative application, or when the unmarried sibling is admitted to the United States does not affect eligibility.
