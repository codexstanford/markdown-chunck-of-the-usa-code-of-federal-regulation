(c)The practitioner must properly complete and sign any Form EOIR-28 or Form EOIR-61, as required by the form instructions. A practitioner's personal appearance or signature on the Form EOIR-28 or Form EOIR-61 constitutes an attestation that the person is authorized and qualified to appear as a practitioner in accordance with ยง 1292.1. Further proof that the practitioner meets the qualifications of a practitioner as defined in ยง 1292.1 may be required. The completion of a Form EOIR-28 or Form EOIR-61 in connection with an application or form that requires disclosure of the preparer does not relieve a practitioner from complying with the particular disclosure requirements of the application or form. Notwithstanding the completion of a Form EOIR-28 or Form EOIR-61, the practitioner must identify themselves by name, accompanied by their signature, on any document filed or intended to be filed with the immigration court pursuant to an appearance under paragraph (a) or (b).
