#### PART 245 - ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS TO THAT OF PERSON ADMITTED FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCE
##### ยง 245.23 Adjustment of aliens in T nonimmigrant classification.
###### Exceptions.

(c)An alien is not eligible for adjustment of status under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section if:

(1) The alien's T nonimmigrant status has been revoked pursuant to 8 CFR 214.11(s);

(2) The alien is described in sections 212(a)(3), 212(a)(10)(C), or 212(a)(10)(E) of the Act; or

(3) The alien is inadmissible under any applicable provisions of section 212(a) of the Act and has not obtained a waiver of inadmissibility in accordance with 8 CFR 212.18 or 214.11(j). Where the alien establishes that the victimization was a central reason for the alien's unlawful presence in the United States, section 212(a)(9)(B)(iii) of the Act is not applicable, and the alien need not obtain a waiver of that ground of inadmissibility. The alien, however, must submit with the Form I-485 evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the victimization suffered was a central reason for the unlawful presence in the United States. To qualify for this exception, the victimization need not be the sole reason for the unlawful presence but the nexus between the victimization and the unlawful presence must be more than tangential, incidental, or superficial.
