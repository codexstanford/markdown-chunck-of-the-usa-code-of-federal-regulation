####### Temporary increase in the automatic extension period.

(5)The authorized extension period stated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 8 CFR 274a.2(b)(1)(vii), and referred to in paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section is increased to up to 540 days for all eligible classes of aliens as described in paragraph (d)(1) who properly filed their renewal application on or before October 26, 2023. Such automatic extension period will automatically terminate the earlier of up to 540 days after the expiration date of the Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766, or successor form) or upon issuance of notification of a denial on the renewal request, even if such date is after October 26, 2023. Aliens whose automatic extension under paragraph (d)(1) expired before May 4, 2022, will receive an automatic resumption of employment authorization and the validity of their Employment Authorization Document, as applicable, for an additional period beginning from May 4, 2022, and up to 540 days from the expiration of their employment authorization and/or Employment Authorization Document as shown on the face of such document. An Employment Authorization Document that has expired on its face is considered unexpired when combined with a Notice of Action (Form I-797C), which demonstrates that the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section and this paragraph (d)(5) have been met, notwithstanding any notations on such notice indicating an automatic extension of up to 180 days. Nothing in this paragraph (d)(5) will affect DHS's ability to otherwise terminate any employment authorization or Employment Authorization Document, or extension period for such employment authorization or document, by written notice to the applicant, by notice to a class of aliens published in theor as provided by statute or regulation, including 8 CFR 274a.14.
