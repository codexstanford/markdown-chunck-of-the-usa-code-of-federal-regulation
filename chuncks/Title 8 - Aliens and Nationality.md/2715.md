() DHS may adjust the reservation of numbers for specified occupational categories for a fiscal year or other period via publication of a notice in theas long as such adjustment is consistent with paragraph (w)(1)(x)(A) of this section. DHS will base any such adjustment on factors including: The level of past demand for reserved numbers compared to supply; whether a reservation of numbers has resulted in unused numbers; reservation of numbers compared to overall numerical limitation in a fiscal year; and any recommendation received from the Governor of the CNMI regarding the adjustment of the reservation of numbers.

(E) If the numerical limitation is not reached for a specified fiscal year, unused numbers do not carry over to the next fiscal year.

(F) If USCIS receives a sufficient number of petitions to meet the numerical limitation in paragraph (w)(1)(x)(A) of this section in a fiscal year, USCIS will cease processing further cap-subject petitions in that fiscal year, and DOL may cease processing cap-subject applications for temporary labor certification for that fiscal year.
