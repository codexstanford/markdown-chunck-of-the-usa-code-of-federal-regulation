###### Public charge bonds for adjustment of status applicants.

(a)If, in the course of adjudicating an application for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident, USCIS determines that the alien is inadmissible only under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, and that the application for adjustment of status is otherwise approvable, USCIS may invite the alien to submit a public charge bond as a condition of approval of the adjustment of status application. Subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and 8 CFR 103.6, USCIS will set the bond amount and provide instructions for the submission of a public charge bond. Public charge bonds may be in the form of a surety bond or an agreement covering cash deposits.
