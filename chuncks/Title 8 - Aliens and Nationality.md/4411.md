###### Sanctions upon notification by the Secretary of Labor.

(4)If CBP is notified by the Secretary of Labor that an entity has either misrepresented facts in its attestation or has failed to meet a condition attested to, then CBP will take the necessary steps to prevent the landing of vessels owned or chartered by the offending entity in accordance with section 258(c)(4)(E)(i) of the Act. CBP may also impose a sanction as provided in that section, including the prohibition of any vessel owned or chartered by the violating entity from landing at any United States port for up to one year.

(5) The three variations of the prevailing practice exception-collective bargaining agreement, attestation process, and automated equipment-are port specific. If a vessel is to use nonimmigrant crewmen to perform longshore work under the prevailing practice exception, the appropriate documentation required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be presented for each port at which the longshore work will be performed.
