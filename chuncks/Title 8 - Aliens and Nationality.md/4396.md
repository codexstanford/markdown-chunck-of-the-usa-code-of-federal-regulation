###### Afflicted crewman.

(b)Any alien crewman afflicted with feeblemindedness, insanity, epilepsy, tuberculosis in any form, leprosy, or any dangerous contagious disease, or an alien crewman suspected of being so afflicted shall upon arrival at the first port of call in the United States, be paroled to the medical institution designated by the district director in whose district the port is located, in the custody (other than during the period of time he is in such medical institution) of the agent of the vessel or aircraft on which such alien arrived in the United States and at the expense of the transportation line for a period initially not to exceed thirty days, for treatment and observation, under the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act. Unless the Public Health Surgeon at the first port certifies that such parole be effected immediately for emergent reasons, the district director may defer execution of parole to a subsequent port of the United States to which the vessel or aircraft will proceed, if facilities not readily available at the first port are readily available at such subsequent port of call. Notice to remove an afflicted alien crewman shall be served by the examining immigration officer upon the master or agent of the vessel or aircraft on Form I-259 and shall specify the date when and the place to which such alien crewman shall be removed and the reasons therefor.
