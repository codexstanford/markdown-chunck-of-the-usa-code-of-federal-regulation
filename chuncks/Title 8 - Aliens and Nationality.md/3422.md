####### Retaking custody of a previously released minor.

(n)(1) In addition to the ability to make a UAC determination upon each encounter as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, DHS may take a minor back into custody if there is a material change in circumstances indicating the minor is an escape-risk, a danger to the community, or has a final order of removal. If the minor is accompanied, DHS shall place the minor in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (i) of this section. If the minor is a UAC, DHS shall transfer the minor into HHS custody in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) DHS may take a minor back into custody if there is no longer a parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, or grandparent) available to care for the minor. If the minor is a UAC, DHS will transfer custody to HHS as outlined in paragraph (e) of this section.

(3) Minors who are not UACs and who are taken back into DHS custody may request a custody redetermination hearing in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and to the extent permitted by 8 CFR 1003.19.
