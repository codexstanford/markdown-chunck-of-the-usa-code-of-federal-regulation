###### Beneficiary of a blanket petition.

(ii)Each alien seeking L classification and admission under a blanket petition shall present a copy of Form I-797 and a Form I-129S from the petitioner which identifies the position and organization from which the employee is transferring, the new organization and position to which the employee is destined, a description of the employee's actual duties for both the new and former positions, and the positions, dates, and locations of previous L stays in the United States. A current copy of Form I-797 and Form I-129S should be retained by the beneficiary and used for leaving and reentering the United States to resume employment with a qualifying organization during his/her authorized period of stay, for applying for a new or revalidated visa, and for applying for readmission at a port of entry. The alien may be readmitted even though reassigned to a different organization named on the Form I-797 than the one shown on Form I-129S if the job duties are virtually the same.
