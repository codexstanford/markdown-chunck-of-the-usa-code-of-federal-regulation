###### ii,Sufficient registrations to meet the H-1B advanced degree exemption numerical limitation.

()If USCIS determines that it has received more than enough registrations to meet the H-1B advanced degree exemption numerical limitation, USCIS will no longer accept registrations that may be eligible for exemption under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act and will notify the public of the final registration date. USCIS will randomly select the number of registrations needed to meet the H-1B advanced degree exemption numerical limitation from among the remaining registrations that may be counted against the advanced degree exemption numerical limitation. This random selection will be made via computer-generated selection.
