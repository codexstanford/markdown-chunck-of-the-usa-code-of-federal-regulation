(22)The ultimate decision to grant or deny CW-1 or CW-2 classification or status is a discretionary determination, and the petition or the application may be denied for failure of the petitioner or the applicant to demonstrate eligibility or for other good cause. The denial of a petition to classify an alien as a CW-1 may be appealed to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office or any successor body. The denial of CW-1 or CW-2 status within the CNMI, or of an application for change or extension of status filed under this section, may not be appealed.
