##### ยง 253.2 Termination of parole.
###### General.

(a)At the expiration of the period of parole authorized by the district director, or when the purpose of the parole has been served, whichever is earlier, the agent upon whom the relating Form I-259 was served as provided in ยง 253.1, shall present the alien crewman for inspection to an immigration officer at the Service office specified in the Form I-259. If the agent cannot present the alien crewman, the agent shall immediately submit a report of the reasons therefor to the district director. The district director shall take such further action as the circumstances may require. If the vessel or aircraft on which the alien crewman arrived in the United States is still in the United States when he is presented for inspection, he shall be treated as an applicant for a conditional landing permit and his case shall be dealt with in the same manner as any other applicant for a conditional landing permit. If the vessel or aircraft on which the alien crewman arrived in the United States departed before he was presented for inspection, the agent shall be directed by means of written notice on Form I-259 to arrange for the removal of the alien crewman from the United States, and if such alien crewman thereafter departs voluntarily from the United States within the time specified by the district director, such departure shall not be considered a deportation within the meaning of this section.
