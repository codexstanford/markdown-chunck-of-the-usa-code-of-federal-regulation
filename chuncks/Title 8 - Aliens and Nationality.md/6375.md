##### ยง 1245.1 Eligibility.
###### Application for adjustment of status filed after October 17, 1991.

(B)An alien who files an application for adjustment of status after October 17, 1991, will not automatically be considered as having maintained lawful nonimmigrant status. An alien who files for adjustment after this date will be subject to the statutory bar of section 245(c)(2) of the Act and will be ineligible to apply for adjustment of status if he or she has failed to continuously maintain lawful nonimmigrant status (other than through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons); if he or she was not in lawful nonimmigrant status at the time the application was filed; or if he or she was employed without authorization on or after November 29, 1990. Unauthorized employment which has been waived as a basis for ineligibility for adjustment of status may not be used as the basis of a determination that the applicant is ineligible for adjustment of status due to failure to continuously maintain lawful nonimmigrant status.
