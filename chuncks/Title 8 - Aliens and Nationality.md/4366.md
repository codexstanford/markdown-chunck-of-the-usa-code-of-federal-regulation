###### Exception to the requirement to submit Form I-418 data elements and longshore work information electronically.

(6)The master or agent of any vessel that is arriving in the United States from a foreign place or an outlying possession of the United States, and is required to submit a manifest, may submit a paper Form I-418 to CBP upon arrival at the port where immigration inspection is performed when:

(i) The master or agent of the vessel is unable to electronically submit the data elements required on Form I-418 via an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP because there is no internet access in that location or onboard computers are experiencing technical difficulties, and there is no shore-side support available; or

(ii) CBP is experiencing technical difficulties affecting its receipt or processing of electronically submitted information, or, in its discretion, CBP determines that a paper Form I-418 is acceptable under the circumstances presented by the master or agent of a vessel.
