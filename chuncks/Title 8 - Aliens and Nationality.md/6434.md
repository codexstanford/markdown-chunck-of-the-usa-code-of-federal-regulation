###### Decision.

(l)In the case of an application for adjustment of status filed pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 102-404, the authority conferred upon district directors in 8 CFR part 1245 to accept and adjudicate an application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act is delegated exclusively to the service center director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence in the United States. If the service center director transfers the application to the district director, authority to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 102-404 lies with the district director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence.
