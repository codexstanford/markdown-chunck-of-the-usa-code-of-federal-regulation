##### ยง 214.11 Alien victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons.
###### USCIS employee referral.

(o)Any USCIS employee who, while carrying out his or her official duties, comes into contact with an alien believed to be a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons and is not already working with an LEA should consult, as necessary, with the ICE officials responsible for victim protection, trafficking investigations and prevention, and deterrence. The ICE office may, in turn, refer the victim to another LEA with responsibility for investigating or prosecuting severe forms of trafficking in persons. If the alien has a credible claim to victimization, USCIS may advise the alien that he or she can submit an application for T nonimmigrant status and seek any other benefit or protection for which he or she may be eligible, provided doing so would not compromise the alien's safety.
