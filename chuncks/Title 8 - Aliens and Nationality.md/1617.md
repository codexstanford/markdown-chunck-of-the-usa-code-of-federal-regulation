###### Admission of the spouse and minor children of an F-1 student.

(3)The spouse and minor children accompanying an F-1 student are eligible for admission in F-2 status if the student is admitted in F-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an F-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in F-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an F-1 student must individually present a Form I-20 or successor form in the name of each F-2 dependent issued by a school certified by SEVP for attendance by F-1 students. A new Form I-20 or successor form is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the F-1 student's current information.
