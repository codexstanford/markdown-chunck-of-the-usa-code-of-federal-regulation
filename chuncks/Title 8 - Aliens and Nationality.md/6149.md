###### ยง 1240.26 Voluntary departure - authority of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.
####### Authority of the Board to grant voluntary departure in the first instance.

(k)The following procedures apply to any request for voluntary departure reviewed by the Board:

(1) The Board shall not remand a case to an immigration judge to reconsider a request for voluntary departure. If the Board first finds that an immigration judge incorrectly denied an alien's request for voluntary departure or failed to provide appropriate advisals, the Board shall consider the alien's request for voluntary departure de novo and, if warranted, may enter its own order of voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal.

(2) In cases which an alien has appealed an immigration judge's decision or in which DHS and the alien have both appealed an immigration judge's decision, the Board shall not grant voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act unless:

(i) The alien requested voluntary departure under that section before the immigration judge, the immigration judge denied the request, and the alien timely appealed;

(ii) The alien's notice of appeal specified that the alien is appealing the immigration judge's denial of voluntary departure and identified the specific factual and legal findings that the alien is challenging;

(iii) The Board finds that the immigration judge's decision was in error; and

(iv) The Board finds that the alien meets all applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for voluntary departure under that section.

(3) In cases in which DHS has appealed an immigration judge's decision, the Board shall not grant voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act unless:

(i) The alien requested voluntary departure under that section before the immigration judge and provided evidence or a proffer of evidence in support of the alien's request;

(ii) The immigration judge either granted the request or did not rule on it; and,

(iii) The Board finds that the alien meets all applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for voluntary departure under that section.

(4) The Board may impose such conditions as it deems necessary to ensure the alien's timely departure from the United States, if supported by the record on appeal and within the scope of the Board's authority on appeal. Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the Board shall advise the alien in writing of the conditions set by the Board, consistent with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (i) of this section (other than paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section), except that the Board shall advise the alien of the duty to post the bond with the ICE Field Office Director within 10 business days of the Board's order granting voluntary departure if that order was served by mail and shall advise the alien of the duty to post the bond with the ICE Field Office Director within five business days of the Board's order granting voluntary departure if that order was served electronically. If documentation sufficient to assure lawful entry into the country to which the alien is departing is not contained in the record, but the alien continues to assert a request for voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act and the Board finds that the alien is otherwise eligible for voluntary departure under the Act, the Board may grant voluntary departure for a period not to exceed 120 days, subject to the condition that the alien within 60 days must secure such documentation and present it to DHS and the Board. If the Board imposes conditions beyond those specifically enumerated, the Board shall advise the alien in writing of such conditions. The alien may accept or decline the grant of voluntary departure and may manifest his or her declination either by written notice to the Board within five days of receipt of its decision, by failing to timely post any required bond, or by otherwise failing to comply with the Board's order. The grant of voluntary departure shall automatically terminate upon a filing by the alien of a motion to reopen or reconsider the Board's decision, or by filing a timely petition for review of the Board's decision. The alien may decline voluntary departure if he or she is unwilling to accept the amount of the bond or other conditions.
