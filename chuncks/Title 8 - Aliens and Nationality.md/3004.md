###### Effect of revocation.

(4)Revocation of a principal alien's application for T-1 nonimmigrant status will result in termination of T-1 status for the principal alien and, consequently, the automatic termination of the derivative T nonimmigrant status for all derivatives. If a derivative application is pending at the time of revocation, it will be denied. Revocation of an approved application for T-1 nonimmigrant status or an application for derivative T nonimmigrant status also revokes any waiver of inadmissibility granted in conjunction with such application. The revocation of an alien's T-1 status will have no effect on the annual cap described in paragraph (j) of this section.
