###### Extension of stay.

(2)An alien in I status who is described in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section may be eligible for extensions of stay, each of up to the maximum period of stay determined by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section or until the activities or assignments consistent with the I classification are completed (whichever date is earlier).

(i) Notwithstanding 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20), an alien in I status who is described in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section whose status has expired, but who timely filed an application for an extension of stay, is authorized to stay in the United States and continue employment with the same employer for a period not to exceed 90 days beginning on the date of the expiration of the authorized period of stay. However, if USCIS adjudicates the application prior to the expiration of the 90-day period, and denies the application for an extension of stay, the alien must immediately depart the United States.

(ii) To request an extension of stay, an alien in I status must file an application to extend his or her stay by submitting the form designated by USCIS, in accordance with that form's instructions, and with the required fee, including any biometrics required by 8 CFR 103.16, as appropriate. Requests for extensions of stay will be adjudicated consistent with international legal obligations, including the United Nations Headquarters Agreement and Organization of American States Headquarters Agreement.
