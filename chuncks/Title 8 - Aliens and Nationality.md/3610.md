###### ยง 241.4 Continued detention of inadmissible, criminal, and other aliens beyond the removal period.
####### No significant likelihood or removal.

(7)During the custody review process as provided in this paragraph (i), or at the conclusion of that review, if the alien submits, or the record contains, information providing a substantial reason to believe that the removal of a detained alien is not significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, the HQPDU shall treat that as a request for review and initiate the review procedures under ยง 241.13. To the extent relevant, the HQPDU may consider any information developed during the custody review process under this section in connection with the determinations to be made by the Service under ยง 241.13. The Service shall complete the custody review under this section unless the HQPDU is able to make a prompt determination to release the alien under an order of supervision under ยง 241.13 because there is no significant likelihood that the alien will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future.
