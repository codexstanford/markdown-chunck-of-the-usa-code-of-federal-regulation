##### ยง 1245.15 Adjustment of status of certain Haitian nationals under the Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA).
###### Adjudication and issuance.

(2)Employment authorization may not be issued to an applicant for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA until the adjustment application has been pending for 180 days, unless the Director of the Nebraska Service Center verifies that Service records contain evidence that the applicant meets the criteria set forth in section 902(b) or 902(d) of HRIFA, and determines that there is no indication that the applicant is clearly ineligible for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA, in which case the Director may approve the application for employment authorization, and issue the resulting document, immediately upon such verification. If the Service fails to adjudicate the application for employment authorization upon expiration of the 180-day waiting period, or within 90 days of the filing of application for employment authorization, whichever comes later, the alien shall be eligible for interim employment authorization in accordance with ยง 1274a.13(d) of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall preclude an applicant for adjustment of status under HRIFA from being granted an initial employment authorization or an extension of employment authorization under any other provision of law or regulation for which the alien may be eligible.
