(1)Extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm is a higher standard than extreme hardship as described in 8 CFR 240.58. A finding of extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm may not be based solely upon current or future economic detriment, or the lack of, or disruption to, social or economic opportunities. The determination of extreme hardship is made solely by USCIS.
