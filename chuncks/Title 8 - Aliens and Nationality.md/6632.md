##### ยง 1245.21 Adjustment of status of certain nationals of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos (section 586 of Public Law 106-429).
###### Procedures when the 5,000 limit is reached.

(4)DHS will track the total number of adjustments and stop processing applications after the 5,000 limit has been reached. When the limit is reached, DHS will return any additional applications to applicants with a dated notice encouraging applicants to retain their application package and the notice in the event the 5,000 limit is expanded or eliminated and the alien wishes to apply again. DHS will keep an identifying chronological record of the application for purposes of processing applications under this section if the 5,000 limit subsequently is expanded or eliminated. If at the time the 5,000 limit is reached, it appears that Congress is about to pass legislation to expand or eliminate the cap, DHS retains the discretion to retain such applications and the related fees.
