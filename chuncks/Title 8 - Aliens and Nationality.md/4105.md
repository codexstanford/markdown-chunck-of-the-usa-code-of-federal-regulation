###### ยง 245a.2 Application for temporary residence.
####### Departure.

(m)(1) During the time period from the date that an alien's application establishing prima facie eligibility for temporary resident status is reviewed at a Service Legalization Office and the date status as a temporary resident is granted, the alien applicant can only be readmitted to the United States provided his or her departure was authorized under the Service's advance parole provisions contained in ยง 212.5(f) of this chapter.

(2) An alien whose application for temporary resident status has been approved may be admitted to the United States upon return as a returning temporary resident provided he or she:

(i) Is not under deportation proceedings, such proceedings having been instituted subsequent to the approval of temporary resident status. A temporary resident alien will not be considered deported if that alien departs the United States while under an outstanding order of deportation issued prior to the approval of temporary resident status;

(ii) Has not been absent from the United States more than thirty (30) days on the date application for admission is made;

(iii) Has not been absent from the United States for an aggregate period of more than 90 days since the date the alien was granted lawful temporary resident status;

(iv) Presents Form I-688;

(v) Presents himself or herself for inspection; and

(vi) Is otherwise admissible.

(3) The periods of time in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) and (m)(2)(iii) of this section may be waived at the discretion of the Attorney General in cases where the absence from the United States was due merely to a brief temporary trip abroad due to emergent or extenuating circumstances beyond the alien's control.
