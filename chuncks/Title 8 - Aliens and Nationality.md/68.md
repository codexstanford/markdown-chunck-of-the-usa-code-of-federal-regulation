##### ยง 101.5 Special immigrant status for certain G-4 nonimmigrants.
###### Maintenance of nonimmigrant status.

(d)Section 101(a)(27)(I) (i), and (ii) requires the applicant to accrue the required period of residence and physical presence in the United States while maintaining status as a G-4 or N nonimmigrant. Section 101(a)(27)(I)(iii) requires such time accrued only in G-4 nonimmigrant status.

Maintaining G-4 status for this purpose is defined as maintaining qualified employment with a "G" international organization or maintaining the qualifying family relationship with the G-4 international organization officer or employee. Maintaining status as an N nonimmigrant for this purpose requires the qualifying family relationship to remain in effect. Unauthorized employment will not remove an otherwise eligible alien from G-4 status for residence and physical presence requirements, provided the qualifying G-4 status is maintained.
