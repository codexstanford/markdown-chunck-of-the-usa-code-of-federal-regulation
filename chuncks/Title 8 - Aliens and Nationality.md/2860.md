#### PART 214 - NONIMMIGRANT CLASSES
##### ยง 214.6 Citizens of Canada or Mexico seeking temporary entry under USMCA to engage in business activities at a professional level.
###### Temporary entry,

as defined in the USMCA, means entry without the intent to establish permanent residence. The alien must satisfy the inspecting immigration officer that the proposed stay is temporary. A temporary period has a reasonable, finite end that does not equate to permanent residence. In order to establish that the alien's entry will be temporary, the alien must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspecting immigration officer that his or her work assignment in the United States will end at a predictable time and that he or she will depart upon completion of the assignment.
