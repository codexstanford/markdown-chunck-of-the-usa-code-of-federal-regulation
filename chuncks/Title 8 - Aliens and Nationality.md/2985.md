###### Age-out protection for child of a principal alien 21 years of age or older.

(iii)If a T-1 principal alien was 21 years of age or older when he or she filed for T-1 nonimmigrant status, USCIS will continue to consider a child as an eligible family member if the child was under 21 years of age at the time the principal filed for T-1 nonimmigrant status. The child will remain eligible even if the child is over 21 years of age at the time of adjudication of the T-1 application. The age of the child when USCIS adjudicates the T-1 application, when the child files the derivative application, when USCIS adjudicates the derivative application, or when the child is admitted to the United States does not affect eligibility.
