####### Continuances, adjournments, and filing extensions due to exigent circumstances.

(4)The immigration judge may continue a status conference or a hearing, or extend a filing deadline, and a status conference or a hearing set forth in this section may be adjourned, where necessary due to exigent circumstances, such as the unavailability of an immigration judge, the respondent, or either party's counsel assigned to the case due to illness; or the closure of the immigration court or a relevant DHS office. Any such continuance, extension, or adjournment shall be limited to the shortest period feasible and shall not be counted against the time limits set forth in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. A new finding of exigent circumstances must be made to justify any and every subsequent continuance, extension, or adjournment under this paragraph (h)(4).
