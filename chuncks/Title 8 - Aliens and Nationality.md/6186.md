####### General.

(e)An application under this section shall be made only during the hearing and shall not be held to constitute a concession of alienage or deportability in any case in which the respondent does not admit his alienage or deportability. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit DHS from using information supplied in an application for asylum or withholding of deportation submitted to an asylum officer pursuant to ยง 1208.2 of this chapter on or after January 4, 1995, as the basis for issuance of an order to show cause or a notice to appear to establish alienage or deportability in a case referred to an immigration judge under ยง 1208.14(b) of this chapter. The respondent shall have the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. The respondent shall not be required to pay a fee on more than one application within paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, provided that the minimum fee imposed when more than one application is made shall be determined by the cost of the application with the highest fee. Nothing contained in this section is intended to foreclose the respondent from applying for any benefit or privilege which he or she believes himself or herself eligible to receive in proceedings under this part.
