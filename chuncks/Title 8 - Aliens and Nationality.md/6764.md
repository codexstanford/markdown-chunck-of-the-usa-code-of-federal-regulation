#### PART 1337 - OATH OF ALLEGIANCE
##### ยง 1337.1 Oath of allegiance.
###### Alteration of form of oath; affirmation in lieu of oath.

(b)In those cases in which a petitioner or applicant for naturalization is exempt from taking the oath prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in its entirety, the inapplicable clauses shall be deleted and the oath shall be taken in such altered form. When a petitioner or applicant for naturalization, by reason of religious training and belief (or individual interpretation thereof), or for other reasons of good conscience, cannot take the oath prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section with the words "on oath" and "so help me God" included, the words "and solemnly affirm" shall be substituted for the words "on oath," the words "so help me God" shall be deleted, and the oath shall be taken in such modified form. Any reference to 'oath of allegiance' in 8 CFR chapter I is understood to mean equally 'affirmation of allegiance' as described in this paragraph.
