Such a denial shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new petition once the petitioner has acquired five years of lawful permanent residence.

Unless the petition is approved, the beneficiary shall not be accorded a filing date within the meaning of section 203(c) of the Act based upon any spousal second preference petition.
