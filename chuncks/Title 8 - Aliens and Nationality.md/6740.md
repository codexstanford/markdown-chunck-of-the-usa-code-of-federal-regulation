####### Finality of decision.

(f)The Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) determination to approve a request to renew recognition or accreditation is final. An organization whose request for renewal of recognition or accreditation of its representatives has been disapproved may make one request for reconsideration of the disapproval within 30 days of the determination. The recognition of the organization and the accreditation of any representatives for whom the organization timely requests reconsideration shall remain valid pending the Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) consideration of the reconsideration request, except in the case of an interim suspension pursuant to 8 CFR 1003.111. An organization whose recognition or accreditation of its representatives is terminated because the organization's request to renew recognition or accreditation is disapproved or whose request for reconsideration after disapproval and, if applicable, request for administrative review pursuant to ยง 1292.18 was denied, may submit a new request for recognition and accreditation at any time unless otherwise prohibited.
