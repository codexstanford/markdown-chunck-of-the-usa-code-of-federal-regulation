###### Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date.

(8)The Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date gives the official date for the school's denial or withdrawal to be final and SEVIS access to be terminated. In most situations, SEVP will not adjust a SEVIS access termination date for that school when the appeals process has concluded and the denial or withdrawal has been upheld, in accordance with ยง 214.4(i)(2). The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on that date.
