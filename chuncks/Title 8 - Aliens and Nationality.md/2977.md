(2)A T-1 principal alien may submit an application for derivative T nonimmigrant status on the form designated by USCIS in accordance with the form instructions. The application for derivative T nonimmigrant status for an eligible family member may be filed with the T-1 application, or separately. Derivative T nonimmigrant status is dependent on the principal alien having been granted T-1 nonimmigrant status and the principal alien maintaining T-1 nonimmigrant status. If a principal alien granted T-1 nonimmigrant status cannot maintain status due to his or her death, the provisions of section 204(l) of the Act may apply.
