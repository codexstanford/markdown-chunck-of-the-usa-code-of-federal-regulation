(C)Public Law 101-649 (the Immigration Act of 1990), which became law on November 29, 1990, retroactively amended Public Law 101-238 (the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989). An alien whose application for adjustment of status under the provisions of Public Law 101-238 was denied by the district director before November 29, 1990, because of unauthorized employment, failure to continuously maintain a lawful nonimmigrant status, or not being in lawful immigration status at the time of filing, may file a motion to reopen the adjustment application. The motion to reopen must be made in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 103.5. The district director will reopen the application for adjustment of status and enter a new decision based upon the provisions of Public Law 101-238, as amended by Public Law 101-649. Any other alien whose application for adjustment of status was denied may file a motion to reopen or reconsider in accordance with normal statutory and regulatory provisions.
