####### Referral of denied cases for consideration of issuance of notice to appear.

(c)If an application is denied, the case will be referred to the district director with jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence for consideration of whether to issue a notice to appear. After an initial denial, an applicant's case will not be referred for issuance of a notice to appear until 90 days from the date of the initial denial, to allow the alien the opportunity to file a new Form I-817 application in order to attempt to overcome the basis of the denial. However, if the applicant is found not to be eligible for benefits under ยง 236.13(b), the Service reserves the right to issue a notice to appear at any time after the initial denial.
