###### Child born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

(b)A child born in the United States is born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and is a United States citizen if the parent is not a "foreign diplomatic officer" as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. This includes, for example, a child born in the United States to one of the following foreign government officials or employees:

(1) Employees of foreign diplomatic missions whose names appear in the State Department list entitled "Employees of Diplomatic Missions Not Printed in the Diplomatic List," also known as the White List; employees of foreign diplomatic missions accredited to the United Nations or the Organization of American States; or foreign diplomats accredited to other foreign states. The majority of these individuals enjoy certain diplomatic immunities, but they are not "foreign diplomatic officers" as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The immunities, if any, of their family members are derived from the status of the employees or diplomats.

(2) Foreign government employees with limited or no diplomatic immunity such as consular officials named on the State Department list entitled "Foreign Consular Officers in the United States" and their staffs.
