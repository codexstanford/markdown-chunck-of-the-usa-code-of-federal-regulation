###### Criteria for Determining Who Must Be Bonded
####### ยง 453.6 Officers, agents, shop stewards or other representatives or employees of a trust in which a labor organization is interested.
######## Officers, agents, shop stewards or other representatives.

(a)While the definition of the collective term "Officer, agent, shop steward, or other representative" in section 3(q) of the Act is expressly applicable only "when used with respect to a labor organization," the use of this term in connection with trusts in which a labor organization is interested makes it clear that, in that connection, it refers to personnel of such trusts in positions similar to those enumerated in the definition. Thus, the term covers trustees and key administrative personnel of trusts, such as the administrator of a trust, heads of departments or major units, and persons in similar positions. It covers such personnel, including trustees, regardless of whether they are representatives of or selected by labor organizations, or representatives of or selected by employers,and such personnel must be bonded if they handle funds or other property of the trust within the meaning of section 502(a).
