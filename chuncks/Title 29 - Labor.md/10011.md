####### Implementation,Do I need to keep OSHA injury and illness records for short-term establishments (i.e., establishments that will exist for less than a year)?

(b)-(1)Yes, however, you do not have to keep a separate OSHA 300 Log for each such establishment. You may keep one OSHA 300 Log that covers all of your short-term establishments. You may also include the short-term establishments' recordable injuries and illnesses on an OSHA 300 Log that covers short-term establishments for individual company divisions or geographic regions.
