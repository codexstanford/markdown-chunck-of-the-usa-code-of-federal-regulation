####### See Dillingham,

Even if the state laws enacted to establish programs of the sort described above "reference" employee benefit plans in a literal sense, they should not be seen as laws that "relate to" ERISA plans in the sense ERISA section 514(a) uses that statutory term because they are completely voluntary from the employer's perspective, the state program would be entirely subject to ERISA, and state law would not impose any outside regulatory requirements beyond ERISA. They do not require employers to establish ERISA-covered plans, forbid any type of plan or restrict employers' choices with respect to benefit structures or their administration. These laws would merely offer a program that employers could accept or reject.519 U.S. at 325-28.
