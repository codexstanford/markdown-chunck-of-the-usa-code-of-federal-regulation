##### § 4.10 Substantial variance proceedings under section 4(c) of the Act.
###### Statutory provision.

(a)Under section 4(c) of the Act, and under corresponding wage determinations made as provided in section 2(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, contractors and subcontractors performing contracts subject to the Act generally are obliged to pay to service employees employed on the contract work wages and fringe benefits not less than those to which they would have been entitled under a collective bargaining agreement if they were employed on like work under a predecessor contract in the same locality. (See §§ 4.1b, 4.3, 4.6(d)(2).) Section 4(c) of the Act provides, however, that "such obligations shall not apply if the Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with regulations adopted by the Secretary that such wages and fringe benefits are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality".
