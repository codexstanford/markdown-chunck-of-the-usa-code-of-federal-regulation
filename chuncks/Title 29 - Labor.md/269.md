(2) Since section 3(a) of the Act provides that accrued contract funds withheld to pay employees wages must be held in a deposit fund, it is the position of the Department of Labor that monies so held may not be used or set aside for agency reprocurement costs. To hold otherwise would be inequitable and contrary to public policy, since the employees have performed work from which the Government has received the benefit (seev.132 Ct. Cl. 724, 728, 135 F. Supp. 381 (1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 902), and to give contracting agency reprocurement claims priority would be to require employees to pay for the breach of contract between the employer and the agency. The Comptroller General has sanctioned priority being afforded wage underpayments over the reprocurement costs of the contracting agency following a contractor's default or termination for cause. Decision of the Comptroller General, B-167000, June 26, 1969; B-178198, August 30, 1973; and B-189137, August 1, 1977.

(3) Wage claims have priority over reprocurement costs and tax liens without regard to when the competing claims were raised. See Decisions of the Comptroller General, B-161460, May 25, 1967; B-189137, August 1, 1977.
