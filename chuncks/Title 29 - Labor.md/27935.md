(2)We waive a premium penalty if you show reasonable cause for a failure to pay a premium in full and on time. See §§ 22 through 25 for guidelines on "reasonable cause" waivers. If there is reasonable cause for only part of a failure to pay a premium, we waive the premium penalty only for that part.
