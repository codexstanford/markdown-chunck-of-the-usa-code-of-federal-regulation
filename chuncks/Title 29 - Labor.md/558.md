###### Civil action to recover greater underpayments than those withheld.

(d)If the payments withheld under ยง 10.11(c) are insufficient to reimburse all workers' lost wages, or if there are no payments to withhold, the Department of Labor, following a final order of the Secretary, may bring action against the contractor in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the remaining amount of underpayments.

Any sum not paid to a worker because of inability to do so within three years shall be transferred into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.
