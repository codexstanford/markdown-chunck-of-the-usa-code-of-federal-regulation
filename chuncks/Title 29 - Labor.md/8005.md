####### Duplication.

(2)The FMCS will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Agency must honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where the Agency can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the Agency will provide one copy per request at cost ($0.05 per page). For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the FMCS will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the Agency will charge the direct costs.
