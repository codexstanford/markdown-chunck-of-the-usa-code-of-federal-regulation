####### Applicability of the Act: Exemptions
######## ยง 500.30 Persons not subject to the Act.
######### Twenty-five mile intrastate radius

(1)as used in section 4(a)(3)(D) of the Act means that engagement in a farm labor contracting activity may not go beyond a twenty-five mile intrastate geographical radius. Once this limit is transcended, the exemption no longer applies and the person becomes subject to the requirements of the Act. If, for example, a person or his employee solicits workers from a distance greater than twenty-five miles from his permanent residence or from across a State line, then the person has engaged in a named activity outside of the permitted scope of the exemption, and is subject to the requirements of the Act. A person who uses lines of communication (such as U.S. Mail, telephone, or advertising) to recruit, solicit, hire, or furnish workers over a distance greater than twenty-five miles from his permanent residence or from across a State line for agricultural employment is also engaged in a named activity beyond the specified limit of the exemption and is subject to the Act. In the case of a corporation its permanent place of residence for these purposes shall be a single designated location.
