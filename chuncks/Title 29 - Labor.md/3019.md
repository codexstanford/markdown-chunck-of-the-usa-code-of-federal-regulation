(9)In the collection of information for criminal enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light. Furthermore, the accuracy of such information can often only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would inhibit the ability of government attorneys in exercising their judgment in reporting on information and investigations and impede the development of criminal information and related data necessary for effective law enforcement.
