###### ยง 102.5 Filing and service of papers by parties: Form of papers; manner and proof of filing or service.
####### Filing by fax with the Agency.

(e)Only unfair labor practice charges, petitions in representation proceedings, objections to elections, and requests for extensions of time for filing documents will be accepted by the Agency if faxed to the appropriate office. Other documents may not be faxed. At the discretion of the receiving office, the person submitting a document by fax may be required simultaneously to file the original with the office by overnight delivery service. When filing a charge, a petition in a representation proceeding, or election objections by fax pursuant to this section, receipt of the faxed document by the Agency constitutes filing with the Agency. A failure to timely file or serve a document will not be excused on the basis of a claim that facsimile transmission could not be accomplished because the receiving machine was off-line or busy or unavailable for any other reason.
