(1) Except as provided in ยง 500.123, no vehicle liability insurance policy or liability bond shall be required of the employer, if such worker is transported only under circumstances for which there is coverage under such State law.

(2) A liability insurance policy or liability bond shall be required of the employer for circumstances under which coverage for the transportation of such worker is not provided under such State law.

(b) [Reserved]

(c) A farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association who is the employer of a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker may evidence the issuance of workers' compensation insurance and passenger insurance under paragraph (a) of this section by obtaining and making available upon request to the Department of Labor:
