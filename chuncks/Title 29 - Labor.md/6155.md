####### Engaging in "The Production of Goods for Commerce"
######## ยง 776.18 Employees of producers for commerce.
######### Employments not directly essential to production distinguished.

(b)Employees of a producer of goods for commerce are not covered as engaged in such production if they are employed solely in connection with essentially local activities which are undertaken by the employer independently of his productive operations or at most as a dispensable, collateral incident to them and not with a view to any direct function which the activities serve in production. It is clear, for example, that an employee would not be covered merely because he works as a domestic servant in the home of an employer whose factory produces goods for commerce, even though he is carried on the factory payroll. To illustrate further, a producer may engage in essentially local activities as a landlord, restauranteur, or merchant in order to utilize the opportunity for separate and additional profit from such ventures or to provide a convenient means of meeting personal needs of his employees. Employees exclusively employed in such activities of the producer are not engaged in work "closely related" and "directly essential" to his production of goods for commerce merely because they provide residential, eating, or other living facilities for his employees who are engaged in the production of such goods.Such employees are to be distinguished from employees like cooks, cookees, and bull cooks in isolated lumber camps or mining camps, where the operation of a cookhouse may in fact be "closely related" and "directly essential" or, indeed, indispensable to the production of goods for commerce.
