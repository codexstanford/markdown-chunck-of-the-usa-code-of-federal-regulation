####### ยง 810.105 Calculating the average hourly base wage rate.
######## Total base wages

(3)is calculated using a two-step process. First, multiply each worker's hourly base wage rate (for the time period described in paragraph (d) of this section) by that worker's number of hours worked in direct production at that rate (for the same time period). Second, add the values calculated in step one to obtain total base wages paid for all hours worked in direct production at the plant or facility.

(c) The producer must include all hours worked in direct production at a plant or facility (other than by workers described in ยง 810.130) when calculating the average hourly base wage rate for that plant or facility. Where a worker is paid by a third party (such as a temporary employment agency), only the wages received by the worker are included in the average hourly base wage rate calculation.

(d) The producer must elect one of the following periods to calculate the average hourly base wage rate:

(1) The producer's previous fiscal year;

(2) The previous calendar year;

(3) The quarter or month to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported;

(4) The producer's fiscal year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported; or

(5) The calendar year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported.
