##### ยง 71.6 Fees for access to records.
###### Notice of estimated fees in excess of $250.

(c)When a component determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section may amount to more than $250, the component shall notify the requester as soon as practicable of the actual or estimated amount of the fee, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay a fee as high as that estimated. If the fee is estimated to be in excess of $250, then the agency may require payment in advance. (If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee.) Where the estimated fee exceeds $250 and a component has so notified the requester, the component will be deemed not to have received the request for access to records until the requester has paid the anticipated fee, in full or in part. A notice to a requester pursuant to this paragraph shall offer him the opportunity to confer with Department personnel with the object of reformulating his request to meet his needs at a lower cost.
