####### Radial saws.

(e)Unless fixed or manually adjustable enclosures or guards provide equivalent protection, radial saws shall be guarded as follows:

(1) The upper hood of radial saws shall enclose the upper portion of the blade up to and including the end of the saw arbor and shall protect the operator from being struck by debris. The sides of the lower exposed portion of the blade shall be guarded to the blade diameter by a device automatically adjusting to the thickness of the stock and remaining in contact with the stock. The lower guard may be removed only when the saw is used for bevel cuts;

(2) Radial saws used for ripping shall have non-kickback fingers or dogs on both sides to oppose the thrust or tendency of the saw to pick up material or throw material toward the operator;

(3) Adjustable stop shall be provided to prevent travel of radial saw blades beyond the table's edge;

(4) Radial saws shall be installed so that the cutting head returns to the starting position without rebound when released; and

(5) The employer shall direct that employees perform ripping and ploughing against the saw turning direction. Rotation direction and an indication of the end of the saw to be used shall be conspicuously marked on the hood.
