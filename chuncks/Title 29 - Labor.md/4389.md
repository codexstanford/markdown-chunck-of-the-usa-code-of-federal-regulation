##### PART 453 - GENERAL STATEMENT CONCERNING THE BONDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE LABOR-MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1959
###### Criteria for Determining Who Must Be Bonded
####### ยง 453.6 Officers, agents, shop stewards or other representatives or employees of a trust in which a labor organization is interested.
######## Independent institutions not included.

(b)The analogy to the definition of the term "officer, agent, shop steward, or other representative," when used with respect to a labor organization, shows that banks and other qualified financial institutions in which trust funds are deposited are not to be considered as "agents" or "representatives" of trusts within the meaning of section 502 and thus are not subject to the bonding requirement, even though they may also have administrative or management responsibilities with respect to such trusts. Similarly, the bonding requirement does not apply to brokers or other independent contractors who have contracted with trusts for the performance of functions which are normally not carried out by officials or employees of such trusts such as the buying of securities, the performance of other investment functions, or the transportation of funds by armored truck.
