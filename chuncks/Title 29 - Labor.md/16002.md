###### Appendix B to Subpart T of Part 1910 - Guidelines for Scientific Diving
######## i.e.,

(a) Regardless of the type of diving equipment used by a diver (open-circuit SCUBA or rebreathers), the employer must ensure that the equipment contains (or incorporates) an open-circuit emergency-egress system (a "bail-out" system) in which the second stage of the regulator connects to a separate supply of emergency breathing gas, and the emergency breathing gas consists of air or the same nitrox breathing-gas mixture used during the dive.

(b) As an alternative to the "bail-out" system specified in paragraph 7(a) of this appendix, the employer may use:

(i) For open-circuit SCUBA, an emergency-egress system as specified in ยง 1910.424(c)(4); or

(ii) For a semi-closed-circuit and closed-circuit rebreather, a system configured so that the second stage of the regulator connects to a reserve supply of emergency breathing gas.

(c) The employer must obtain from the rebreather manufacturer sufficient information to ensure that the bail-out system performs reliably and has sufficient capacity to enable the diver to terminate the dive and return safely to the surface.

(a) Before each day's diving operations, the employer must:

(i) Verify that a hospital, qualified health-care professionals, and the nearest Coast Guard Coordination Center (or an equivalent rescue service operated by a state, county, or municipal agency) are available to treat diving-related medical emergencies;

(ii) Ensure that each dive site has a means to alert these treatment resources in a timely manner when a diving-related medical emergency occurs; and

(iii) Ensure that transportation to a suitable decompression chamber is readily available when no decompression chamber is at the dive site, and that this transportation can deliver the injured diver to the decompression chamber within four (4) hours travel time from the dive site.

(b) The employer must ensure that portable Oequipment is available at the dive site to treat injured divers. In doing so, the employer must ensure that:

(i) The equipment delivers medical-grade Othat meets the requirements for medical USP oxygen (Type I, Quality Verification Level A) of CGA G-4.3-2000 ("Commodity Specification for Oxygen");

(ii) The equipment delivers this Oto a transparent mask that covers the injured diver's nose and mouth; and

(iii) Sufficient Ois available for administration to the injured diver from the time the employer recognizes the symptoms of a diving-related medical emergency until the injured diver reaches a decompression chamber for treatment.

(c) Before each day's diving operations, the employer must:

(i) Ensure that at least two attendants, either employees or non-employees, qualified in first-aid and administering Otreatment, are available at the dive site to treat diving-related medical emergencies; and

(ii) Verify their qualifications for this task.

(a) Before starting each day's diving operations, the employer must:

(i) Designate an employee or a non-employee to make entries in a diving log; and

(ii) Verify that this designee understands the diving and medical terminology, and proper procedures, for making correct entries in the diving log.

(b) The employer must:

(i) Ensure that the diving log conforms to the requirements specified by paragraph (d) ("Record of dive") of ยง 1910.423; and

(ii) Maintain a record of the dive according to ยง 1910.440 ("Recordkeeping requirements").

(c) The employer must ensure that a hard-copy of the no-decompression tables used for the dives (as specified in paragraph 6(a) of this appendix) is readily available at the dive site, whether or not the divers use dive-decompression computers.

The employer must ensure that each diver receives training that enables the diver to perform work safely and effectively while using open-circuit SCUBAs or rebreathers supplied with nitrox breathing-gas mixtures. Accordingly, each diver must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform critical tasks safely and effectively, including, but not limited to: recognizing the effects of breathing excessive COand O; taking appropriate action after detecting excessive levels of COand O; and properly evaluating, operating, and maintaining their diving equipment under the diving conditions they encounter.

(a) The employer must ensure that the rebreather manufacturer has used the following procedures for determining that the CO-sorbent material meets the specifications of the sorbent material's manufacturer:

(i) The North Atlantic Treating Organization COabsorbent-activity test;

(ii) The RoTap shaker and nested-sieves test;

(iii) The Navy Experimental Diving Unit ("NEDU")-derived Schlegel test; and

(iv) The NEDU MeshFit software.

(b) The employer must ensure that the rebreather manufacturer has applied the following canister-testing materials, methods, procedures, and statistical analyses:

(i) Use of a nitrox breathing-gas mixture that has an Ofraction maintained at 0.28 (equivalent to 1.4 ATA of Oat 130 fsw, the maximum Oconcentration permitted at this depth);

(ii) While operating the rebreather at a maximum depth of 130 fsw, use of a breathing machine to continuously ventilate the rebreather with breathing gas that is at 100% humidity and warmed to a temperature of 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C) in the heating-humidification chamber;

(iii) Measurement of the Oconcentration of the inhalation breathing gas delivered to the mouthpiece;

(iv) Testing of the canisters using the three ventilation rates listed in Table I below (with the required breathing-machine tidal volumes and frequencies, and CO-injection rates, provided for each ventilation rate):
