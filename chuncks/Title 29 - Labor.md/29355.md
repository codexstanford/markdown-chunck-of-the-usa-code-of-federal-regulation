######## Employer's proportional share.

(2)An employer's proportional share of the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is computed by multiplying that amount by a fraction-

(i) The numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan (or under the employer's prior plan) by the employer for the last five full plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws; and

(ii) The denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan (or under each employer's prior plan) by all employers for the last five full plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods that were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew from the plan (or prior plan) during those plan years.

(iii) In determining the numerator and the denominator in this paragraph (c), the rules under § 4211.4 (and permissible simplified methods under §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15) apply.
