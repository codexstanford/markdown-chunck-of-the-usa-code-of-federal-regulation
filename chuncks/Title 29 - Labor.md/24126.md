####### How to make.

(a)An application or request for an order must be made by written motion. A motion shall not be included in another pleading or document, such as a brief or petition for discretionary review, but shall be made in a separate document. In exigent circumstances in cases pending before a Judge, an oral motion may be made during an off-the-record telephone conference if the motion is subsequently reduced to writing and filed within such time as the judge prescribes.
