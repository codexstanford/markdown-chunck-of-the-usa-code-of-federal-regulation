####### Section 1915.11(b) Definition of "Hot work."

There are several instances in which circumstances do not necessitate that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting be regarded as hot work. Some examples are:

1. Abrasive blasting of the external surface of the vessel (the hull) for paint preparation does not necessitate pumping and cleaning the tanks of the vessel.

2. Prior to hot work on any hollow structure, the void space should be tested and appropriate precautions taken.
