######## PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.

(f)In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, "bankruptcy filing date" is substituted for "termination date" each place that "termination date" appears in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Example: A plan amendment that was adopted and effective in February 2007 increased a participant's benefit by $300 per month (as computed under ยง 4022.24). The contributing sponsor of the plan filed a bankruptcy petition in March 2009 and the plan has a termination date in April 2010. PBGC's guarantee of the participant's benefit increase is limited to $120 ($300 x 40%), because the increase was made more than 2 years but less than 3 years before the bankruptcy filing date.
