######## ยง 780.135 Meaning of "farm."
######### NLRB,Olaa Sugar Co.,,Mitchell,Huntsville Nurseries,

A "farm" is a tract of land devoted to the actual farming activities included in the first part of section 3(f). Thus, the gathering of wild plants in the woods for transplantation in a nursery is not an operation performed "on a farm." (For a further discussion, see ยง 780.207.) The total area of a tract operated as a unit for farming purposes is included in the "farm," irrespective of the fact that some of this area may not be utilized for actual farming operations (seev.242 F. 2d 714; In re Princeville Canning Co., 14 WH Cases 641 and 762). It is immaterial whether a farm is situated in the city or in the country. However, a place in a city where no primary farming operations are performed is not a farm even if operated by a farmer (v.267 F. 2d 286).
