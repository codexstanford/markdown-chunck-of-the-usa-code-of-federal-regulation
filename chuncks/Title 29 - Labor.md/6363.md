######### Walling,Helmerich & Payne,

(b) Such a division of the normal 8-hour workday into 4 straight time hours and 4 overtime hours is purely fictitious. The employee is not paid at the rate of $5 an hour and the alleged overtime rate of $7.50 per hour is not paid for overtime work. It is not geared either to hours "in excess of the employee's normal working hours or regular working hours" (section 7(e)(5) or for work "outside of the hours established in good faith * * * as the basic, normal, or regular workday" (section 7(e) (7)) and it cannot therefore qualify as an overtime rate. The regular rate of pay of the employee in this situation is $6.25 per hour and he is owed additional overtime compensation, based on this rate, for all hours in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard. This rule was settled by the Supreme Court in the case ofv.323 U.S. 37, and its validity has been reemphasized by the definition of the term "regular rate" in section 7(e) of the Act as amended.
