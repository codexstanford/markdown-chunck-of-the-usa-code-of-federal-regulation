(See ยง 4.165.)

(2) The rules and regulations for furnishing health and welfare and pension benefits to temporary and part-time employees are discussed in ยง 4.176.

(3) The rules and regulations for furnishing equivalent fringe benefits or cash equivalents in lieu of health and welfare and pension benefits are discussed in ยง 4.177.
