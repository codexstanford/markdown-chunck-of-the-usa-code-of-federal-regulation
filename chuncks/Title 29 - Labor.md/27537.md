###### ยง 2704.103 Proceedings covered.

(a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by this Commission. These are adjudications before the Commission arising under the Mine Act in which the position of the Secretary of Labor is represented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. For this Commission, the types of proceedings generally covered include:

(1) Contests of citations or orders issued under section 104 or 107 of the Mine Act (30 U.S.C. 814, 817);

(2) Contests of penalties proposed under section 105 (a) and (b) of the Mine Act (30 U.S.C. 815(a), (b));

(3) Challenges to claims of discrimination under section 105(c) of the Mine Act (30 U.S.C. 815(c)) where the Secretary of Labor represents the miner.

(b) The Commission may also designate a proceeding not listed in paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The Commission's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.

(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
