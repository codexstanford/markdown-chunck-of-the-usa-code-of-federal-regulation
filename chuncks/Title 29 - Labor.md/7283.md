######### Phillips,Walling,,Mitchell,Bekins Van & Storage Co.,

The "enterprise" referred to in the section 7(b)(3) exemption is to be distinguished from an "establishment". As used in the Act, the term "establishment", which is not specially defined therein, refers to a "distinct physical place of business" rather than to "an entire business or enterprise" which may include several separate places of business. (Seev.324 U.S. 490;v.352 U.S. 1027; 95 Congressional Record 12505, 12579, 14877; H. Rept. No. 1453, 81st Cong., first session, p. 25.) It will be noted from the definition of "enterprise" in section 3(r), as set forth in ยง 794.106, that the activities of the enterprise may be "performed in one or more establishments," and section 7(b)(3) specifies that the enterprises to which its exemption requirements are applicable will include "an enterprise with more than one bulk storage establishment."
