####### Initial monitoring.

(2)Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this standard shall perform initial monitoring to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of MDA to which employees may be exposed unless:

(i) The employer can demonstrate, on the basis of objective data, that the MDA-containing product or material being handled cannot cause exposures above the standard's action level, even under worst-case release conditions; or

(ii) The employer has historical monitoring or other data demonstrating that exposures on a particular job will be below the action level.
