The application should also contain a description of the terms of employment relating to overtime so that the Administrator can determine how the established basic rate will be used if it is approved. For instance, if the employees are to be paid time and one-half the basic rate for all hours worked in excess of 35 each workweek, this should be stated in the application. If the employees are to be paid double time for work on Sundays the application should so state.
