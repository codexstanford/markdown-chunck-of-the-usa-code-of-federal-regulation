######### Mitchell,Budd,

Section 13(a)(14) exempts processing operations on shade-grown tobacco only when performed by agricultural employees "employed in the growing and harvesting" of such tobacco. The use of the term "and" in the phrase "growing and harvesting" may be in recognition of the fact that in the raising of shade-grown tobacco the two operations are typically intermingled; however, it is not considered that the word "and" would preclude a determination on the particular facts that an employee is qualified for the exemption if he is employed only in "growing" or only in "harvesting." Employment in work other than growing and harvesting of shade-grown tobacco will not satisfy the requirement that the employee be employed in growing and harvesting, even if such work is on shade-grown tobacco and constitutes "agriculture" as defined in section 3(f) of the Act. For example, delivery of the tobacco by an employee of the farmer to the receiving platform of the bulking plant would be a "delivery to market" included in "agriculture" when performed by the farmer as an incident to or in conjunction with his farming operations (v.350 U.S. 473), but it would not be part of "growing and harvesting."
