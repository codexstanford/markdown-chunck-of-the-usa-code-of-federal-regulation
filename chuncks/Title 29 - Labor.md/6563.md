######## ยง 779.357 May qualify as exempt 13(a)(2) establishments; classification of coal sales.
######### General.

(a)A coal dealer's establishment may qualify as an exempt retail or service establishment under section 13(a)(2) of the Act if it meets all the requirements of that exemption. In determining for purposes of the 13(a)(2) exemption, whether 75 percent of the establishment's sales are recognized as retail in the particular industry, sales of coal to the consumer from a dealer's yard storage, where bulk is broken, are recognized as retail if they meet the requirements for such classification as previously explained in this subpart. It has been determined that the following sales do not meet such requirements and are not so recognized even if made from a dealer's yard storage:

(1) Sales where the delivery is made by railroad car or cargo vessel.

(2) Sales in a carload quantity or more for continuous delivery by truck from a dock, mine or public railroad facility.
