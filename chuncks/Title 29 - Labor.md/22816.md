####### Pre-erection inspection.

(2)Before each crane component is erected, it must be inspected by a qualified person for damage or excessive wear.

(i) The qualified person must pay particular attention to components that will be difficult to inspect thoroughly during shift inspections.

(ii) If the qualified person determines that a component is damaged or worn to the extent that it would create a safety hazard if used on the crane, that component must not be erected on the crane unless it is repaired and, upon reinspection by the qualified person, found to no longer create a safety hazard.

(iii) If the qualified person determines that, though not presently a safety hazard, the component needs to be monitored, the employer must ensure that the component is checked in the monthly inspections. Any such determination must be documented, and the documentation must be available to any individual who conducts a monthly inspection.
