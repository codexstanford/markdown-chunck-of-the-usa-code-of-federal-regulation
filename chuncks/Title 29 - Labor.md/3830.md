######## Requests for Board review of Regional Director actions.

(c)Upon the filing of a request therefor with the Board by any interested person, the Board may review any action of a Regional Director delegated to him/her under Section 3(b) of the Act except as the Board's Rules provide otherwise. The request for review may be filed at any time following the action until 10 business days after a final disposition of the proceeding by the Regional Director. The filing of such a request shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the Board, operate as a stay of the election or any other action taken or directed by the Regional Director, except that if a request for review of a decision and direction of election is filed within 10 business days of that decision and has not been ruled upon or has been granted before the election is conducted, ballots whose validity might be affected by the Board's ruling on the request for review or decision on review shall be segregated in an appropriate manner, and all ballots shall be impounded and remain unopened pending such ruling or decision. A party retains the right to file a request for review of a decision and direction of election more than 10 business days after that decision issues, but the pendency of such a request for review shall not require impoundment of the ballots.
