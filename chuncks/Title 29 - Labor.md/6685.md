(a) Section 3(f) of the Act contains a very comprehensive definition of the term "agriculture." The definition has two distinct branches (seev.337 U.S. 755). One has relation to the primary meaning of agriculture; the other gives to the term a somewhat broader secondary meaning for purposes of the Act (v.242 F. 2d 714).
