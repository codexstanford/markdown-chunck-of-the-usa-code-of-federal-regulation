(b)A truck driver who has to wait at or near the job site for goods to be loaded is working during the loading period. If the driver reaches his destination and while awaiting the return trip is required to take care of his employer's property, he is also working while waiting. In both cases the employee is engaged to wait. Waiting is an integral part of the job. On the other hand, for example, if the truck driver is sent from Washingtion, DC to New York City, leaving at 6 a.m. and arriving at 12 noon, and is completely and specifically relieved from all duty until 6 p.m. when he again goes on duty for the return trip the idle time is not working time. He is waiting to be engaged. (v.323 U.S. 134, 137 (1944);v.3 W.H. Cases 284; 7 Labor Cases para. 61,565 (W.D. Tenn. 1943);v.6 W.H. Cases 806; 12 Labor Cases para. 63,661 (W.D.
