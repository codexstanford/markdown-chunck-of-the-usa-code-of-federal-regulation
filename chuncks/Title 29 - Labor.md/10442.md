####### Fixed ladders.

(d)The employer must ensure:

(1) Fixed ladders are capable of supporting their maximum intended load;

(2) The minimum perpendicular distance from the centerline of the steps or rungs, or grab bars, or both, to the nearest permanent object in back of the ladder is 7 inches (18 cm), except for elevator pit ladders, which have a minimum perpendicular distance of 4.5 inches (11 cm);

(3) Grab bars do not protrude on the climbing side beyond the rungs of the ladder that they serve;

(4) The side rails of through or side-step ladders extend at least 42 inches (1.1 m) above the top of the access level or landing platform served by the ladder. For parapet ladders, the access level is:

(i) The roof, if the parapet is cut to permit passage through the parapet; or

(ii) The top of the parapet, if the parapet is continuous;

(5) For through ladders, the steps or rungs are omitted from the extensions, and the side rails are flared to provide not less than 24 inches (61cm) and not more than 30 inches (76 cm) of clearance. When a ladder safety system is provided, the maximum clearance between side rails of the extension must not exceed 36 inches (91 cm);

(6) For side-step ladders, the side rails, rungs, and steps must be continuous in the extension (see Figure D-2 of this section);

(7) Grab bars extend 42 inches (1.1 m) above the access level or landing platforms served by the ladder;

(8) The minimum size (cross-section) of grab bars is the same size as the rungs of the ladder.

(9) When a fixed ladder terminates at a hatch (see Figure D-3 of this section), the hatch cover:

(i) Opens with sufficient clearance to provide easy access to or from the ladder; and

(ii) Opens at least 70 degrees from horizontal if the hatch is counterbalanced;

(10) Individual-rung ladders are constructed to prevent the employee's feet from sliding off the ends of the rungs (see Figure D-4 of this section);

(11) Fixed ladders having a pitch greater than 90 degrees from the horizontal are not used;

(12) The step-across distance from the centerline of the rungs or steps is:

(i) For through ladders, not less than 7 inches (18 cm) and not more than 12 inches (30 cm) to the nearest edge of the structure, building, or equipment accessed from the ladders;

(ii) For side-step ladders, not less than 15 inches (38 cm) and not more than 20 inches (51 cm) to the access points of the platform edge;

(13) Fixed ladders that do not have cages or wells have:

(i) A clear width of at least 15 inches (38 cm) on each side of the ladder centerline to the nearest permanent object; and

(ii) A minimum perpendicular distance of 30 inches (76 cm) from the centerline of the steps or rungs to the nearest object on the climbing side. When unavoidable obstructions are encountered, the minimum clearance at the obstruction may be reduced to 24 inches (61 cm), provided deflector plates are installed (see Figure D-5 of this section).
