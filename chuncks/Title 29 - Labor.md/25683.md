######## qualified independent fiduciary

(j) Ais any individual or entity with appropriate training, experience, and facilities to act on behalf of the plan regarding the exemption transaction in accordance with the fiduciary duties and responsibilities prescribed by ERISA, that is independent of and unrelated to any party in interest engaging in the exemption transaction and its affiliates; in general, the determination as to the independence of a fiduciary is made by the Department on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. In making this determination, the Department generally will take into account the amount of both the fiduciary's revenues and projected revenues for the current federal income tax year (including amounts received for preparing fiduciary reports) that will be derived from the party in interest or its affiliates relative to the fiduciary's revenues from all sources for the prior federal income tax year. Absent facts and circumstances demonstrating a lack of independence, the Department will operate according to the presumption that such fiduciary will be independent if the revenues it receives or is projected to receive, within the current federal income tax year, from parties in interest (and their affiliates) to the transaction are not more than 2% of such fiduciary's annual revenues based upon its prior income tax year. Although the presumption does not apply when the aforementioned percentage exceeds 2%, a fiduciary nonetheless may be considered independent based upon other facts and circumstances provided that it receives or is projected to receive revenues that are not more than 5% within the current federal income tax year from parties in interest (and their affiliates) to the transaction based upon its prior income tax year.
