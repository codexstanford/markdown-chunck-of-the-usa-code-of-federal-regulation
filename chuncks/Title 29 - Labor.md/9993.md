####### Are there any special rules for determining whether a hearing loss case is work-related?

(5)No. You must use the rules in ยง 1904.5 to determine if the hearing loss is work-related. If an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the hearing loss, or significantly aggravated a pre-existing hearing loss, you must consider the case to be work related.
