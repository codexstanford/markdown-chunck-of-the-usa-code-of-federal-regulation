####### Lump Sum Attributed to Overtime
######## § 778.311 Flat rate for special job performed in overtime hours.
######### Flat rate is not an overtime premium.

(a)The same reasoning applies where employees are paid a flat rate for a special job performed during overtime hours, without regard to the time actually consumed in performance. (This situation should be distinguished from "show-up" and "call-back" pay situations discussed in §§ 778.220 through 778.222 and from payment at a rate not less than one and one-half times the applicable rate to pieceworkers for work performed during overtime hours, as discussed in §§ 778.415 through 778.421). The total amount paid must be included in the regular rate; no part of the amount may be credited toward statutory overtime compensation due.
