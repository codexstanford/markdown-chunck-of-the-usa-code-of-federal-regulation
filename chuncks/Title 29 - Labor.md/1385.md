As to the standard on review with respect to questions of admissibility generally, section 18.104(a),723 F.2d 238, 265-66 (3d Cir. 1983) ("The scope of review of the trial court's trustworthiness determination depends on the basis for the ruling. When the trial court makes ยง 18.104(a) findings of historical fact about the manner in which a report containing findings was compiled we review by the clearly erroneous standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52. But a determination of untrustworthiness, if predicated on factors properly extraneous to such a determination, would be an error of law * * * * There is no discretion to rely on improper factors. Such an error of law might, of course, in a given instance be harmless within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. In weighing factors which we consider proper, the trial court exercises discretion and we review for abuse of discretion. Giving undue weight to trustworthiness factors of slight relevance while disregarding factors more significant, for example, might be an abuse of discretion."). Accord,v.798 F.2d 509 (lst Cir. 1986).
