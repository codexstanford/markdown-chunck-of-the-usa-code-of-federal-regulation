() Where pressure-reducing valves are used, one or more relief or safety valves shall be provided on the low-pressure side of the reducing valve, in case the piping or equipment on the low-pressure side does not meet the requirements for full initial pressure. The relief or safety valve shall be located adjacent to, or as close as possible to, the reducing valve. Proper protection shall be provided to prevent injury or damage caused by fluid escaping from relief or safety valves if vented to the atmosphere. The vents shall be of ample size and as short and direct as possible. The combined discharge capacity of the relief valves shall be such that the pressure rating of the lower-pressure piping and equipment will not be exceeded if the reducing valve sticks or fails to open.
