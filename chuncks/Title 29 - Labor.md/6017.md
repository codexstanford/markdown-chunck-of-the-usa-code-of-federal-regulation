######## ยง 570.125 Actors and performers.

Section 13(c) of the Act provides an exemption from the child labor provisions for "any child employed as an actor or performer in motion pictures or theatrical productions, or in radio or television productions." The term "performer" used in this provision is obviously more inclusive than the term "actor." In regulations issued pursuant to section 7(d)(3) of the Act, the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division has defined a "performer" on radio and television programs for purposes of that section.The Secretary will follow this definition in determining whether a child is employed as a "* * * performer * * * in radio or television productions" for purposes of this exemption. Moreover, in many situations the definition will be helpful in determining whether a child qualifies as a "* * * performer in motion pictures or theatrical productions * * *" within the meaning of the exemption.
