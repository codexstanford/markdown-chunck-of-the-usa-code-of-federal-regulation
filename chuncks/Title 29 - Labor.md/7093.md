##### PART 784 - PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT APPLICABLE TO FISHING AND OPERATIONS ON AQUATIC PRODUCTS
###### Subpart B - Exemptions Provisions Relating to Fishing and Aquatic Products
####### Principles Applicable to the Two Exemptions
######## ยง 784.117 Combinations of exempt work.
######### ยง 784.122 Operations performed as an integrated part of fishing.

Certain other activities performed on a fishing vessel in connection with named operations are, functionally and as a practical matter, directly and necessarily a part of such operations. For example, maintenance work performed by members of the fishing crew during the course of the trip on the fishing boat would necessarily be a part of the fishing operation, since the boat itself is as much a fishing instrument as the fishing rods or nets. Similarly, work required on the vessel to keep in good operating condition any equipment used for processing, canning, or packing the named aquatic products at sea is so necessary to the conduct of such operations that it must be considered a part of them and exempt.
