(i) A visual (digital, graphic, analog) or auditory (voice, pure tone) display that effectively warns the diver of solenoid failure (when the rebreather uses solenoids) and other electrical weaknesses or failures (low battery voltage);

(ii) For a semi-closed circuit rebreather, a visual display for the partial pressure of CO, or deviations above and below a preset COpartial pressure of 0.005 ATA; and

(iii) For a closed-circuit rebreather, a visual display for: partial pressures of Oand CO, or deviations above and below a preset COpartial pressure of 0.005 ATA and a preset Opartial pressure of 1.40 ATA or lower; gas temperature in the breathing loop; and water temperature.

(l) Before each day's diving operations, and more often when necessary, the employer must ensure that the electrical power supply and electrical and electronic circuits in each rebreather are operating as required by the rebreather manufacturer's instructions.
