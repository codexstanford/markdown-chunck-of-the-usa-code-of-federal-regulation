(c)The Department is aware that a concern for states adopting an ERISA plan approach is whether or not those state laws will be held preempted. ERISA preemption analysis begins with the "presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law."v.514 U.S. 645, 654 (1995). The question turns on Congress's intent "to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans."at 654, 657.v.482 U.S. 1, 11 (1987) (goal of ERISA preemption is to "ensure . . . that the administrative practices of a benefit plan will be governed by only a single set of regulations.").
