######## et seq.,,Skidmore,Swift,

As previously stated, the interpretations of the law contained in this part are official interpretations. So long as they remain effective and are not modified, amended, rescinded or determined by judicial authority to be incorrect, they may be relied upon as provided in section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (63 Stat. 910, 29 U.S.C. 251discussed in part 790 of this chapter). In addition, the Supreme Court has recognized that such interpretations of this Act "provide a practical guide to employers and employees as to how the office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it" and "constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance." Further, as stated by the Court: "Good administration of the Act and good judicial administration alike require that the standards of public enforcement and those for determining private rights shall be at variance only where justified by very good reasons." (v.323 U.S. 134).
