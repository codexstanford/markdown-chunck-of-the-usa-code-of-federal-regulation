####### Period of professional engagement

(3)means the period beginning when an accountant either signs an initial engagement letter or other agreement to perform the audit or begins to perform any audit, review or attest procedures (including planning the audit of the plan's financial statements), whichever is earlier, and ending with the formal notification, either by the member or client, of the termination of the professional relationship or the issuance of the audit report for which the accountant was engaged, whichever is later. In the case of an auditor that performs a plan's audit for two or more years, in evaluating independence, the Department would not view the period of professional engagement as ending with the issuance of each year's audit report and recommencing with the beginning of the following year's audit engagement.
