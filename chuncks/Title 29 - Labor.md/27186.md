####### ยง 2590.725-3 Aggregate reporting.
######## Multiple reporting entities.

(2)(i) If multiple reporting entities submit the required data related to one or more plans or issuers in a State and market segment, the data submitted by each of these reporting entities must not be aggregated at a less granular level than the aggregation level used by the reporting entity that submits the data on total annual spending on health care services, as required by ยง 2590.725-4(b)(4), on behalf of these plans or issuers.

(ii) The Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may specify in guidance alternative or additional aggregation methods for data submitted by multiple reporting entities, to ensure a balance between compliance burdens and a data aggregation level that facilitates the development of the biannual public report required under section 725(b) of ERISA.

(3) Group health insurance coverage with dual contracts. If a group health plan involves health insurance coverage obtained from two affiliated issuers, one providing in-network coverage only and the second providing out-of-network coverage only, the plan's out-of-network experience may be treated as if it were all related to the contract provided by the in-network issuer.
