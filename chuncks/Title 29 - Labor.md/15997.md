######## i.e.,

(a) The employer must ensure that each closed-circuit rebreather uses supply-pressure sensors for the Oand diluent (air or nitrogen) gases and continuously functioning sensors for detecting temperature in the inhalation side of the gas-loop and the ambient water.

(b) The employer must ensure that:

(i) At least two Osensors are located in the inhalation side of the breathing loop; and

(ii) The Osensors are: functioning continuously; temperature compensated; and approved by the rebreather manufacturer.

(c) Before each day's diving operations, and more often when necessary, the employer must calibrate Osensors as required by the sensor manufacturer's instructions. In doing so, the employer must:

(i) Ensure that the equipment and procedures used to perform the calibration are accurate to within 1% of the Ofraction by volume;

(ii) Maintain this accuracy as required by the manufacturer of the calibration equipment;

(iii) Ensure that the sensors are accurate to within 1% of the Ofraction by volume;

(iv) Replace Osensors when they fail to meet the accuracy requirements specified in paragraph 2(c)(iii) of this appendix; and

(v) Ensure that the replacement Osensors meet the accuracy requirements specified in paragraph 2(c)(iii) of this appendix before placing a rebreather in operation.

(d) The employer must ensure that each closed-circuit rebreather has:

(i) A gas-controller package with electrically operated solenoid O-supply valves;

(ii) A pressure-activated regulator with a second-stage diluent-gas addition valve;

(iii) A manually operated gas-supply bypass valve to add Oor diluent gas to the breathing loop; and

(iv) Separate Oand diluent-gas cylinders to supply the breathing-gas mixture.

The employer must ensure that the fraction of Oin the nitrox breathing-gas mixture:
