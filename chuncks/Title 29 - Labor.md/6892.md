###### Subpart H - Employment by Small Country Elevators Within Area of Production; Exemption From Overtime Pay Requirements Under Section 13(b)(14)
####### Employees "Employed * * * By" The Country Elevator Establishment
######## § 780.716 Exemption of employees "employed * * * by" the establishment.

If the establishment is a country elevator establishment qualified for exemption as previously explained, and if the "area of production" requirement is met (see § 780.720), any employee "employed * * * by" such establishment will come within the section 13(b)(14) exemption. This will bring within the exemption employees who are engaged in duties performed away from the establishment as well as those whose duties are performed in the establishment itself, so long as such employees are "employed * * * by" the country elevator establishment within the meaning of the Act. The employees employed "by" the establishment, who may come within the exemption if the other requirements are met, are not necessarily identical with the employees employed "in the establishment in such operations" who must be counted for purposes of the five-employee limitation since some of the latter employees may be employed by another employer. (See §§ 780.712 through 780.715.)
