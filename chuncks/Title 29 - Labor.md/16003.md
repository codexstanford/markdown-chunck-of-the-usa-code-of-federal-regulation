######## i.e.,

(v) When using a work rate (breathing-machine tidal volume and frequency) other than the work rates listed in the table above, addition of the appropriate combinations of ventilation rates and CO-injection rates;

(vi) Performance of the COinjection at a constant (steady) and continuous rate during each testing trial;

(vii) Determination of canister duration using a minimum of four (4) water temperatures, including 40, 50, 70, and 90 degrees F (4.4, 10.0, 21.1, and 32.2 degrees C, respectively);

(viii) Monitoring of the breathing-gas temperature at the rebreather mouthpiece (at the "chrome T" connector), and ensuring that this temperature conforms to the temperature of a diver's exhaled breath at the water temperature and ventilation rate used during the testing trial;

(ix) Implementation of at least eight (8) testing trials for each combination of temperature and ventilation-CO-injection rates (for example, eight testing trials at 40 degrees F using a ventilation rate of 22.5 Lpm at a CO-injection rate of 0.90 Lpm);
