####### ยง 4903.21 How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by PBGC?
######## Offset of PBGC payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.

(a)(1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by PBGC and other Federal agencies, a process known as "centralized offset." When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask PBGC (when acting as a "payment agency") to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by PBGC, including salary payments issued to PBGC employees. This section and ยง 4903.21 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks PBGC to offset a payment issued by PBGC to a person who owes a debt to the United States.
