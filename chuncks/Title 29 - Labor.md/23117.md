(a) The Connecticut State plan for State and local government employees received initial approval from the Assistant Secretary on November 3, 1978.

(b) In accordance with 29 CFR 1956.10(g), a State is required to have a sufficient number of adequately trained and competent personnel to discharge its responsibilities under the plan. The Connecticut Public Employee Only State plan provides for three (3) safety compliance officers and one (1) health compliance officer as set forth in the Connecticut Fiscal Year 1986 grant. This staffing level meets the "fully effective" benchmarks established for Connecticut for both safety and health.
