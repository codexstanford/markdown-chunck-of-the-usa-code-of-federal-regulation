###### ยง 4207.6 Partial withdrawals after reentry.
####### General rule.

(a)For purposes of determining whether there is a partial withdrawal of an eligible employer whose liability is abated under this part upon the employer's reentry into the plan or at any time thereafter, the plan sponsor shall apply the rules in section 4205 of ERISA, as modified by the rules in this section, and section 108 of the Multiemployer Act. A partial withdrawal of an employer whose liability is abated under this part may occur under these rules upon the employer's reentry into the plan. However, a plan sponsor may not demand payment of withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal occurring upon the employer's reentry before the plan sponsor has determined that the employer's liability for its complete withdrawal is abated under this part and has so notified the employer in accordance with ยง 4207.3(b).
