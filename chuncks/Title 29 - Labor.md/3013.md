### PART 71 - PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY AND ACCESS TO RECORDS UNDER THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
#### Subpart B - Exemption of Records Systems Under the Privacy Act
##### ยง 71.50 General exemptions pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act.
###### Subsection (d).

(3)Access to records contained in these systems would inform the subject of an actual or potential criminal investigation of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the investigation, of the information and evidence obtained as to his or her activities, and of the identity of witnesses or informants. Such access would, accordingly, provide information that could enable the subject to avoid detection, apprehension, and prosecution. This result, therefore, would constitute a serious impediment to effective law enforcement not only because it would prevent the successful completion of the investigation but also because it could endanger the physical safety of witnesses or informants, lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and imposes an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
