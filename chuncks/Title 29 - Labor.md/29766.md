####### Plans with a suspension of benefits.

(d)If a plan previously suspended benefits under section 305(e)(9) or 4245(a) of ERISA, its application must include a description of how the plan will reinstate the benefits that were previously suspended and a proposed schedule showing aggregate amount and timing of payments (in accordance with ยง 4262.15) to participants and beneficiaries under the plan. The proposed schedule should be prepared assuming the effective date for reinstatement is the SFA measurement date and that payments for previously suspended benefits described in ยง 4262.15(a)(2) are paid or commence on the SFA measurement date. If the plan restored benefits under 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3) before the SFA measurement date, the proposed schedule should reflect the amount and timing of payments of restored benefits and the effect of the restoration on the benefits remaining to be reinstated.
