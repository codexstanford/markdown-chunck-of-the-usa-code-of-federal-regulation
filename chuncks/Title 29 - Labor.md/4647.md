####### General
######## § 500.70 Scope of worker protections.
######### Wage related protections.

(b)Joint employment under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which establishes responsibility for the maintenance of payroll records, payment of wages and posting of notices under that law, is joint employment under MSPA for establishing responsibility for the maintenance of records, payment of wages and the posting of required posters under MSPA. In such joint employment situations the responsibility for assuring these MSPA protections may be carried out by one of the joint employers. While under a joint employment relationship all joint employers are equally responsible for assuring that the appropriate protections are provided, the creation of such a joint employment relationship does not also require unnecessary duplication of effort as, for example, in relation to the posting of posters (see §§ 500.75(e) and 500.76(e)) or the provision of an itemized written statement of the worker's pay (see § 500.80(d)). Failure to provide protections coming within the joint employment relationship, however, will result in all joint employers being responsible for that failure.
