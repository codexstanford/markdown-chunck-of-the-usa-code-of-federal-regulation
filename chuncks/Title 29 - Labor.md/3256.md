###### Filing exceptions to decision.

(4)The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute final action by the Secretary of Labor, unless, within 21 days after receipt of the decision of the administrative law judge, a party dissatisfied with the decision or any part thereof has filed exceptions with the Administrative Review Board (the Board), specifically identifying the procedure or finding of fact, law, or policy with which exception is taken, in accordance with 29 CFR part 26. Any exceptions not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived. Thereafter, the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the decision of the Secretary, unless the Board, within 30 days of such filing, has notified the parties that the case has been accepted for review.
