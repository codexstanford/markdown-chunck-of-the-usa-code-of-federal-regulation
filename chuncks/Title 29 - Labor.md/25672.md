###### Subpart B - Procedures Governing the Filing and Processing of Prohibited Transaction Exemption Applications
####### ยง 2570.30 Scope of rules.

(a) The rules of procedure set forth in this subpart apply to prohibited transaction exemptions issued by the Department under the authority of:

(1) Section 408(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA);

(2) Section 4975(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code);or

(3) The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA) (5 U.S.C. 8477(c)(3)).

(b) Under these rules of procedure, the Department may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any fiduciary or transaction, or class of fiduciaries or transactions, from all or part of the restrictions imposed by section 406 of ERISA and the corresponding restrictions of the Code and FERSA. While administrative exemptions granted under these rules are ordinarily prospective in nature, an applicant may also obtain retroactive relief for past prohibited transactions if certain safeguards described in this subpart were in place at the time the transaction was consummated.

(c) These rules govern the filing and processing of applications for both individual and class exemptions that the Department may propose and grant pursuant to the authorities cited in paragraph (a) of this section. The Department may also propose and grant exemptions on its own motion, in which case the procedures relating to publication of notices, hearings, evaluation and public inspection of the administrative record, and modification or revocation of previously granted exemptions will apply.

(d) The issuance of an administrative exemption by the Department under these procedural rules does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan from the obligation to comply with certain other provisions of ERISA, the Code, or FERSA, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply, and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA which require, among other things, that a fiduciary discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries.

(e) The Department will not propose or issue exemptions upon oral request alone, nor will the Department grant exemptions orally. An applicant for an administrative exemption may request and receive oral advice from Department employees in preparing an exemption application. However, such advice does not constitute part of the administrative record and is not binding on the Department in its processing of an exemption application or in its examination or audit of a plan.

(f) The Department will generally treat any exemption application that is filed solely under section 408(a) of ERISA or solely under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code as an exemption request filed under both section 408(a) and section 4975(c)(2) if it relates to a transaction that would be prohibited both by ERISA and the corresponding provisions of the Code.
