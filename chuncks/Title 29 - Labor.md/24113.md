####### Answer.

(b)(1) Within 21 days after service of the complaint, the party against whom the complaint was issued shall file an answer with the Commission.

(2) The answer shall contain a short and plain statement denying those allegations in the complaint which the party intends to contest. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed admitted.

(3) The answer shall include all affirmative defenses being asserted. Such affirmative defenses include, but are not limited to, "infeasibility," "unpreventable employee misconduct," and "greater hazard."

(4) The failure to raise an affirmative defense in the answer may result in the party being prohibited from raising the defense at a later stage in the proceeding, unless the Judge finds that the party has asserted the defense as soon as practicable.
