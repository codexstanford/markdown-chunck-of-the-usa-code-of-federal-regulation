######### Provided,

(b) In construing section 3(s)(1) of the Act as it was prior to the 1966 amendments it should be noted that section 3(n) of the prior Act defined "resale" by declaring that this term, "except as used in subsection (s)(1), shall not include the sale of goods to be used in residential or farm building construction, repair, or maintenance:That the sale is recognized as a bona fide retail sale in the industry." Thus, although section 3(n) of the prior Act also provided the one exception to the meaning of "resale", it made clear that the exception was inapplicable in determining under section 3(s)(1) of the prior Act, "if such enterprise purchases or receives goods for resale that move or have moved across State lines (not in deliveries from the reselling establishment) which amount in total volume to $250,000 or more". The application of the inflow test under section 3(s) (1) of the prior Act is discussed fully in subpart C of this part.
