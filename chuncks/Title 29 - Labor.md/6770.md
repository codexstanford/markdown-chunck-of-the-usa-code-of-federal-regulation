######## ยง 780.211 Contract production of hatching eggs.

It is common practice for hatcherymen to enter into arrangements with farmer poultry raisers for the production of hatching eggs which the hatchery agrees to buy. Ordinarily, the farmer furnishes the facilities, feed and labor and the hatchery furnishes the basic stock of poultry. The farmer undertakes a specialized program of care and improvement of the flock in cooperation with the hatchery. The hatchery may at times have a surplus of eggs, including those suitable for hatching and culled eggs which it sells. Activities such as grading and packing performed by the hatchery employees in connection with the disposal of these eggs, are an incident to the breeding of poultry by the hatchery and are within the scope of agriculture.
