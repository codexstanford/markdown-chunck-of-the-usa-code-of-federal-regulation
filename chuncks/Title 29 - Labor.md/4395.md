###### Criteria for Determining Who Must Be Bonded
####### ยง 453.8 Personnel who "handle" funds or other property.
######## "Handling" funds or other property without physical contact.

(d)Personnel who do not physically handle funds or property may nevertheless "handle" within the meaning of section 502(a) where they have or perform significant duties with respect to the receipt, safekeeping or disbursement of funds or other property. For example, persons who have access to a safe deposit box or similar depository for the purpose of adding to, withdrawing, checking or otherwise dealing with its contents may be said to "handle" these contents within the meaning of section 502(a) even though they do not at any time during the year actually secure such access for such purposes. Similarly, those charged with general responsibility for the safekeeping of funds or other property such as the treasurer of a labor organization, should be considered as handling funds or other property. It should also be noted that the extent of actual authority to deal with funds or property may be immaterial where custody or other functions have been granted which create a substantial risk of fraud or dishonesty. Thus, if a bank account were maintained in the name of a particular officer or employee whose signature the bank were authorized to honor, it could not be contended that he did not "handle" funds merely because he had been forbidden by the organization or by his superiors to make deposits or withdrawals.
