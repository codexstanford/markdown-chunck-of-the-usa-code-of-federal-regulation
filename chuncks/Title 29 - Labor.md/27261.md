The Commission is an independent agency, not a part of nor affiliated in any way with the U.S. Department of Labor or its Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"). The location of the Commission's headquarters is at 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Suite 520N, Washington, DC 20004-1710; its primary phone number is 202-434-9900; and the fax number of its Docket Office is 202-434-9954. The Commission maintains a Web site atwhere these rules, recent and many past decisions of the Commission and its Judges, and other information regarding the Commission, can be accessed.

(2) Unless the Commission provides otherwise, amendments to these rules are effective 60 days following publication in theand apply to cases initiated after they take effect. They also apply to further proceedings in cases pending on the effective date, except to the extent that application of the amended rules would not be feasible, or would work injustice, in which event the former rules of procedure would continue to apply.
