####### Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.

(c)As pointed out in ยง 4.117, while some Government contracts may be subject both to the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act and to the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, the employees performing work on the contract which is subject to the latter Act are, when so engaged, exempt from the provisions of the former. They are, however, subject to the overtime provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act if, in any workweek, any of the work performed for the employer is subject to such Act and if, in such workweek, the total hours worked by the employee for the employer (whether wholly or only partly on such work) exceed 40 hours in the workweek. In any such workweek the Walsh-Healey Act requires payment of overtime compensation at a rate not less than 1times the employee's basic rate for such weekly overtime hours. The overtime pay provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act are discussed in greater detail in 41 CFR part 50-201.
