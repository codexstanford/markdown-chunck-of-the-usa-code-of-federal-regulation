(a) The term "Harvesting" as used in section 3(f) includes all operations customarily performed in connection with the removal of the crops by the farmer from their growing position (v.230 F. 2d 398;v.242 F. 2d 714). Examples include the cutting of grain, the picking of fruit, the stripping of bluegrass seed, and the digging up of shrubs and trees grown in a nursery. Employees engaged on a plantation in gathering sugarcane as soon as it has been cut, loading it, and transporting the cane to a concentration point on the farm are engaged in "Harvesting" (v.145 F. 2d 552).
