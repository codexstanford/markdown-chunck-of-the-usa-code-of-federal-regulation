() Any fiduciary with investment discretion over the pooled fund's assets, or any affiliate of such fiduciary.

(ii) The exemption application must include, with respect to each plan described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (3), (a)(5) through (7), (a)(10), (a)(12) through (16), and (a)(18) and (19), of this section. The information required by this paragraph must be furnished in reference to the plan's investment in the pooled fund (e.g., the names, addresses and taxpayer identifying numbers of all fiduciaries responsible for the plan's investment in the pooled fund (ยง 2570.35(a) (10)), the percentage of the assets of the plan invested in the pooled fund (ยง 2570.35(a)(12)), whether the plan's investment in the pooled fund has been consummated or will be consummated only if the exemption is granted (ยง 2570.35(a)(13)), etc.).

(iii) The information required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section is in addition to the information required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section relating to information furnished by reference to the pooled fund.

(5) The special rule and the additional requirements described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section do not apply to an individual exemption request solely for the investment by a plan in a pooled fund. Such an application must provide the information required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) Retroactive exemptions:

(1) Generally, the Department will favorably consider requests for retroactive relief, in all exemption applications, only where the safeguards necessary for the grant of a prospective exemption were in place at the time at which the parties entered into the transaction. An applicant for a retroactive exemption must have acted in good faith by taking reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the plan from abuse and unnecessary risk at the time of the transaction.

(2) Among the factors that the Department would take into account in making a finding that an applicant acted in good faith include the following:

(i) The participation of an independent fiduciary acting on behalf of the plan who is qualified to negotiate, approve and monitor the transaction;

(ii) The existence of a contemporaneous appraisal by a qualified independent appraiser or reference to an objective third party source, such as a stock or bond index;

(iii) The existence of a bidding process or evidence of comparable fair market transactions with unrelated third parties;

(iv) That the applicant has submitted an accurate and complete application for exemption containing documentation of all necessary and relevant facts and representations upon which the applicant relied. In this regard, additional weight will be given to facts and representations which are prepared and certified by a source independent of the applicant;

(v) That the applicant has submitted evidence that the plan fiduciary did not engage in an act or transaction knowing that such act or transaction was prohibited under section 406 of ERISA and/or section 4975 of the Code. In this regard, the Department will accord appropriate weight to the submission of a contemporaneous, reasoned legal opinion of counsel, upon which the plan fiduciary relied in good faith before entering the act or transaction;

(vi) That the applicant has submitted a statement of the circumstances which prompted the submission of the application for exemption and the steps taken by the applicant with regard to the transaction upon discovery of the violation;

(vii) That the applicant has submitted a statement, prepared and certified by an independent person familiar with the types of transactions for which relief is requested, demonstrating that the terms and conditions of the transaction (including, in the case of an investment, the return in fact realized by the plan) were at least as favorable to the plan as that obtainable in a similar transaction with an unrelated party; and

(viii) Such other undertakings and assurances with respect to the plan and its participants that may be offered by the applicant which are relevant to the criteria under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code.

(3) The Department, as a general matter, will not favorably consider requests for retroactive exemptions where transactions or conduct with respect to which an exemption is requested resulted in a loss to the plan. In addition, the Department will not favorably consider requests for exemptions where the transactions are inconsistent with the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of sections 403 or 404 of ERISA or the exclusive benefit requirements of section 401(a) of the Code.
