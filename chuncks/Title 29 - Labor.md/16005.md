(xii) Analysis of the canister-duration results using the repeated-measures statistics described in NEDU Report 2-99;

(xiii) Specification of the replacement schedule for the CO-sorbent materials in terms of the lower prediction line (or limit) of the 95% confidence interval; and

(xiv) Derivation of replacement schedules only by interpolating among, but not by extrapolating beyond, the depth, water temperatures, and exercise levels used during canister testing.
