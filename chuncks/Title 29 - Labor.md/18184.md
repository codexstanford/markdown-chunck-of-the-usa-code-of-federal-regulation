####### Hooks.

(b)(1) The manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed in determining the safe working loads of the various sizes and types of specific and identifiable hooks. All hooks for which no applicable manufacturer's recommendations are available shall be tested to twice the intended safe working load before they are initially put into use. The employer shall maintain and keep readily available a certification record which includes the date of such tests, the signature of the person who performed the test and an identifier for the hook which was tested.

(2) Loads shall be applied to the throat of the hook since loading the point overstresses and bends or springs the hook.

(3) Hooks shall be inspected periodically to see that they have not been bent by overloading. Bent or sprung hooks shall not be used.
