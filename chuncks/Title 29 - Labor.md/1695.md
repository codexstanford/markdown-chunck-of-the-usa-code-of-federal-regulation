###### Policy.

(b)Executive Order 14026 states that the Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are promoted when the Federal Government contracts with sources that adequately compensate their workers. Specifically, the Order explains that raising the minimum wage enhances worker productivity and generates higher-quality work by boosting workers' health, morale, and effort; reducing absenteeism and turnover; and lowering supervisory and training costs. Accordingly, Executive Order 14026 sets forth a general position of the Federal Government that increasing the hourly minimum wage paid by Federal contractors to $15.00 beginning January 30, 2022, (with future annual increases based on inflation) will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. The Order provides that executive departments and agencies, including independent establishments subject to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that new covered contracts, contract-like instruments, and solicitations (collectively referred to as "contracts") include a clause, which the contractor and any covered subcontractors shall incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, as a condition of payment, that the minimum wage to be paid to workers, including workers whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c), performing work on or in connection with the contract or any covered subcontract thereunder, shall be at least:

(1) $15.00 per hour beginning January 30, 2022; and

(2) Beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) pursuant to the Order. Nothing in Executive Order 14026 or this part shall excuse noncompliance with any applicable Federal or state prevailing wage law or any applicable law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under the Order.
