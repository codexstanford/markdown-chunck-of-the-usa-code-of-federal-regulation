####### ยง 4000.24 What if I mail my submission or issuance using the U.S. Postal Service?
######## Requirements for "send date."

(b)Your submission or issuance must meet the applicable postal requirements, be properly addressed, and you must use First-Class Mail (or a U.S. Postal Service mail class that is at least the equivalent of First-Class Mail, such as Priority Mail or Express Mail). However, if you are filing an advance notice of reportable event or a Form 200 (notice of certain missed contributions), see ยง 4000.23(b); these filings are always treated as filed when received.
