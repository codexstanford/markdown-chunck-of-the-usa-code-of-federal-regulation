(3)The notices for these systems of records published in theset forth the basic statutory or related authority for maintenance of this system. However, in the course of civil and related investigations, cases and matters, the agency will occasionally obtain information concerning actual or potential violations of law that are not strictly or technically within its statutory or other authority or may compile information in the course of an investigation which may not be relevant to a specific case. In the interests of effective investigation, it is necessary to retain some or all of such information in these systems of records since it can aid in establishing patterns of compliance and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies. Moreover, it is difficult to know during the course of an investigation what is relevant and necessary. In this connection, facts or evidence may not seem relevant at first, but later in the investigation, their relevance is borne out.
