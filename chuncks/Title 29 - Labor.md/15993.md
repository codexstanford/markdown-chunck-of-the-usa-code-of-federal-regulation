######## e.g.,,e.g.,

(ii) The COsensor is integrated with an alarm that operates in a visual (digital, graphic, analog) or auditory (voice, pure tone) mode that is readily detectable by each diver under the diving conditions in which the diver operates; and

(iii) The COalarm remains continuously activated when the inhaled COlevel reaches and exceeds 0.005 atmospheres absolute (ATA).

(f) Before each day's diving operations, and more often when necessary, the employer must calibrate the COsensor according to the sensor manufacturer's instructions, and ensure that:

(i) The equipment and procedures used to perform this calibration are accurate to within 10% of a COconcentration of 0.005 ATA or less;

(ii) The equipment and procedures maintain this accuracy as required by the sensor manufacturer's instructions; and

(iii) The calibration of the COsensor is accurate to within 10% of a COconcentration of 0.005 ATA or less.

(g) The employer must replace the COsensor when it fails to meet the accuracy requirements specified in paragraph 1(f)(iii) of this appendix, and ensure that the replacement COsensor meets the accuracy requirements specified in paragraph 1(f)(iii) of this appendix before placing the rebreather in operation.

(h) As an alternative to using a continuously functioning COsensor, the employer may use a schedule for replacing CO-sorbent material provided by the rebreather manufacturer. The employer may use such a schedule only when the rebreather manufacturer has developed it according to the canister-testing protocol specified below in Condition 11, and must use the canister within the temperature range for which the manufacturer conducted its scrubber canister tests following that protocol. Variations above or below the range are acceptable only after the manufacturer adds that lower or higher temperature to the protocol.
