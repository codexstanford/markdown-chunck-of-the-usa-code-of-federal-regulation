(a)In determining, under the 13(a)(2) exemption, whether 75 percent of the establishment's sales are not for resale and are recognized as retail sales in the industry, sales to the ultimate consumer of liquefied-petroleum-gas, whether delivered in portable cylinders or in bulk to the customer's storage tanks, are recognized as retail in the industry if they meet all the requirements for such classification as previously explained in this subpart.

(2) Sales made on a competitive bid basis (this term covers sales made pursuant to an invitation to bid, particularly sales to Federal, State and local governments; sales made in a like manner to commercial and industrial concerns and institutions are also included); and

(3) Sales for use in the production of a specific product in which the gas is an essential ingredient or principal raw material, such as sales of liquefied-petroleum-gas for the production of chemicals and synthetic rubber; and

(4) Sales of liquefied-petroleum-gas for use as truck or bus fuel and the repair and servicing of trucks and buses used in over-the-road commercial transportation (including parts and accessories for such vehicles).
