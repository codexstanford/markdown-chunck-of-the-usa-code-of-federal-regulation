######### Production of goods for commerce.

(c)The "production" phase of coverage includes "any closely related process or occupation directly essential" to production of goods for commerce. An employee need not be engaged in activities indispensable to production in order to be covered. Conversely, even indispensable or essential activities, in the sense of being included in the long line of causation which ultimately results in production of finished goods, may not be covered. The work must be both closely related and directly essential to the covered production.
