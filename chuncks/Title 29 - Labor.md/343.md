(a)(1) Where underpayments by a contractor or subcontractor total less than $1,000, and where there is no reason to believe that the violations are aggravated or willful (or, in the case of the Davis-Bacon Act that the contractor has disregarded its obligations to employees and subcontractors), and where restitution has been effected and future compliance assured, the Federal agency need not submit its investigative findings and recommendations to the Administrator, unless the investigation was made at the request of the Department of Labor. In the latter case, the Federal agency shall submit a factual summary report detailing any violations including any data on the amount of restitution paid, the number of workers who received restitution, liquidated damages assessed under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, corrective measures taken (such as "letters of notice"), and any information that may be necessary to review any recommendations for an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages under ยง 5.8.

(2) Where underpayments by a contractor or subcontractor total $1,000 or more, or where there is reason to believe that the violations are aggravated or willful (or, in the case of the Davis-Bacon Act, that the contractor has disregarded its obligations to employees and subcontractors), the Federal agency shall furnish within 60 days after completion of its investigation, a detailed enforcement report to the Administrator.
