###### ยง 2200.73 Interlocutory review.
####### General.

(a)Interlocutory review of a Judge's ruling is discretionary with the Commission. A petition for interlocutory review may be granted only where the petition asserts and the Commission finds:

(1) That the review involves an important question of law or policy that controls the outcome of the case, and that immediate review of the ruling will materially expedite the final disposition of the proceedings or subsequent review by the Commission may provide an inadequate remedy; or

(2) That the ruling will result in a disclosure, before the Commission may review the Judge's report, of information that is alleged to be privileged.
