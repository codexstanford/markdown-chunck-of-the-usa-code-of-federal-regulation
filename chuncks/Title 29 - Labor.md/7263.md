###### Requirements for Exemption
####### ยง 793.18 Location of "major studio."
######## Principal city.

(e)The term "principal city", as used in section 13(b)(9), means the "central city", or cities, of the standard metropolitan statistical area, which are defined and designated as such by the Bureau of the Census. The name of the "central city" is incorporated in the name of the standard metropolitan statistical area. Where two or more cities are designated by the Bureau of the Census as the "central cities", the names of such cities appear in the title of the standard metropolitan statistical area. For example, the "Duluth-Superior" standard metropolitan statistical area, has two "central" cities, namely Duluth and Superior; both appear in the title of the standard metropolitan statistical area, and both are regarded as "principal" cities for purposes of the section 13(b)(9) exemption. Where, as in the example, more than one city is designated as the "central" city airline mileage will be measured from that "central" city which is nearest to the city or town in which the major studio of the radio or television station is located.
