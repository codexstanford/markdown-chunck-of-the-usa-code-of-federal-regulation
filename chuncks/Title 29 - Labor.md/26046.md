(iii) For purposes of a distribution pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(B)() of this section, a qualified termination administrator shall be responsible for the selection of an annuity provider in accordance with section 404 of the Act.

(3) If assets of an abandoned plan are held by a person other than the qualified termination administrator, such person shall not be treated as in violation of section 404 (a) the Act solely on the basis that the person cooperated with and followed the directions of the qualified termination administrator in carrying out its responsibilities under this section with respect to such plan, provided that, in advance of any transfer or disposition of any assets at the direction of the qualified termination administrator, such person confirms with the Department of Labor that the person representing to be the qualified termination administrator with respect to the plan is the qualified termination administrator recognized by the Department of Labor.
