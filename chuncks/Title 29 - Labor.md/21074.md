(Shield system) means a structure that is able to withstand the forces imposed on it by a cave-in and thereby protect employees within the structure. Shields can be permanent structures or can be designed to be portable and moved along as work progresses. Additionally, shields can be either premanufactured or job-built in accordance with ยง 1926.652 (c)(3) or (c)(4). Shields used in trenches are usually referred to as "trench boxes" or "trench shields."
