######## 2,Conclusion.,Example 3

()The same terms requirement of this paragraph (c)(3) is satisfied in this paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(C) () because paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section allows the maximum dollar amount made available in an HRA to increase as the number of the participant's dependents covered by the HRA increases and Plan Sponsor C makes the same amount available to each employee with the same number of dependents covered by the HRA.
