##### § 99.520 Major program determination.
###### Step 3.

(d)(1) The auditor shall identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in § 99.525. However, should the auditor select Option 2 under Step 4 (paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section), the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs. Except for known reportable conditions in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in § 99.525(b)(1), § 99.525(b)(2), and § 99.525(c)(1), a single criteria in § 99.525 would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk.

(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed the larger of:

(i) $100,000 or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has less than or equal to $100 million in total Federal awards expended.

(ii) $300,000 (or $500,000 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003) or three-hundredths of one percent (.0003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has more than $100 million in total Federal awards expended.
