###### Subpart B - Interpretations
####### Authorized Basic Rates
######## ยง 548.306 Average earnings for year or quarter year preceding the current quarter.
######### Example.,quarterly,annual,last quarter

(2)Assume that an employee employed under a similar arrangement agrees to receive overtime premium pay for each workweek on the normal pay day, based each quarter on one-half his established basic rate determined by themethod rather than by themethod previously discussed. His established basic rate for the first quarter of 1964 would therefore be determined by computing his average hourly rate for theof 1963. To illustrate, if in the latter quarter the employee received $1,156.00 in straight time compensation and worked 561 hours, his basic rate for the first quarter of 1964 would therefore be $2.06 ($1,156.00 &#xF7; 561 hours). During the overtime weeks in this quarter there would be due him, in addition to his straight time compensation, premium pay of $1.03 ($2.06 x 1/2) for each hour he works in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard.

As in the previous example the established basic rate must be used in every overtime week in the quarter for which it was computed without regard to the employee's true hourly rate in the particular quarter.
