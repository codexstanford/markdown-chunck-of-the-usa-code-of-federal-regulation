(a)This subpart describes PBGC's missing participants program for multiemployer defined benefit retirement plans covered by title IV of ERISA. The missing participants program is a program to hold retirement benefits for missing participants and beneficiaries in retirement plans that are closing out and to help them find and receive the benefits being held for them. For a plan to which this subpart applies, this subpart describes what the plan must do upon plan termination if it has missing participants or beneficiaries who are entitled to distributions. This subpart applies to a plan only if it is a multiemployer defined benefit plan that-

(1) Is described in section 4021(a) of ERISA and not in any paragraph of section 4021(b) of ERISA, and

(2) Completes the process of closing out under subpart D of PBGC's regulation on Termination of Multiemployer Plans (29 CFR part 4041A).
