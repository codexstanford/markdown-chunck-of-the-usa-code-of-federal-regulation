(3)The sponsor will implement measures to ensure that its outreach and recruitment efforts for apprentices extend to all persons available for apprenticeship within the sponsor's relevant recruitment area without regard to race, sex, ethnicity, or disability. In furtherance of this requirement, the sponsor must:

(i) Develop and update annually a list of current recruitment sources that will generate referrals from all demographic groups within the relevant recruitment area. Examples of relevant recruitment sources include: The public workforce system's One-Stop Career Centers and local workforce investment boards; community-based organizations; community colleges; vocational, career and technical schools; pre-apprenticeship programs; and Federally-funded, youth job-training programs such as YouthBuild and Job Corps or their successors;

(ii) Identify a contact person, mailing address, telephone number, and email address for each recruitment source; and

(iii) Provide recruitment sources advance notice, preferably 30 days, of apprenticeship openings so that the recruitment sources can notify and refer candidates. Such notification must also include documentation of the sponsor's equal opportunity pledge specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
