###### Is regarded as having such an impairment.

(7)The following principles apply under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of "disability" (paragraph (q)(1)(iii) of this section):

(i) Except as set forth in paragraph (q)(7)(ii) of this section, an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual is subjected to an action prohibited by WIOA Section 188 and this part because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment substantially limits, or is perceived to substantially limit, a major life activity, even if the recipient asserts, or may or does ultimately establish, a defense to the action prohibited by WIOA Section 188 and this part.

(ii) An individual is not "regarded as having such an impairment" if the recipient demonstrates that the impairment is, objectively, both "transitory" and "minor." A recipient may not defeat "regarded as" coverage of an individual simply by demonstrating that it subjectively believed the impairment was transitory and minor; rather, the recipient must demonstrate that the impairment is (in the case of an actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a perceived impairment), objectively, both "transitory" and "minor." For purposes of this section, "transitory" is defined as lasting or expected to last six months or less.

(iii) Establishing that an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established only when an individual proves that a recipient discriminated on the basis of disability within the meaning of federal nondiscrimination law and this part.
