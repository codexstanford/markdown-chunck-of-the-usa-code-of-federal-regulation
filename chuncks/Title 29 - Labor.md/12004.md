(iii) When a regulator or pressure relief valve is used inside a building for other than purposes specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) ()-() of this section, the relief valve and the space above the regulator and relief valve diaphragms shall be vented to the outside air with the discharge outlet located not less than 3 feet horizontally away from any building opening which is below such discharge. These provisions do not apply to individual appliance regulators when protection is otherwise provided nor to paragraph (c)(5) of this section and paragraph (b)(10)(xiii) of this section. In buildings devoted exclusively to gas distribution purposes, the space above the diaphragm need not be vented to the outside.
