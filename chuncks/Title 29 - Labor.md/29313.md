####### ยง 4211.16 Simplified methods for disregarding benefit reductions and benefit suspensions.
######## Adjustment of allocation fraction.

(3)If another significant contributing employer-Employer B-had withdrawn in 2019 and was unable to satisfy its withdrawal liability claim, the allocation fraction applicable to the value of the suspended benefits is adjusted. The contributions in the denominator for the last 5 plan years ending in 2017 is reduced by the contributions that were made by Employer B, thereby increasing Employer A's allocable share of the $30 million value of the suspended benefits.
