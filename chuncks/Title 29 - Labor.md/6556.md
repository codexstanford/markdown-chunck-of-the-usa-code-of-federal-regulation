######## § 779.355 Classification of lumber and building materials sales.
######### Transactions not recognized as retail sales.

(b)(See §§ 779.314 through 779.329.) Dollar volume derived from the following is not made from sales or services which are recognized as retail in the industry:

(1) Contracts to build, maintain, or repair buildings or other structures, or sales of services involving performance of typical construction activity or any other work recognized as an activity of a contracting business rather than a function of a retail merchant;

(2) Sales of lumber and building materials in which the seller agrees to install them for the purchaser, where the installation is not limited to services that are merely incidental to the sale and delivery of such materials but includes a substantial amount of activity such as construction work which is not recognized as retail (for example, sale and installation of roofing, siding, or insulation). A sale of such materials which would otherwise be recognized as retail (contracts described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are outside this category) may be so recognized notwithstanding the installation agreement, however, to the extent that the sales value of the materials is segregated and separately identified in the transaction;

(3) Sales in direct carload shipments; that is, where the materials are shipped direct in carload lots from the dealer's supplier to the dealer's customer;
