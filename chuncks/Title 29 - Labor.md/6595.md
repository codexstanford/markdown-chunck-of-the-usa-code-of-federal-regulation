######## ยง 779.371 Some automobile, truck, and farm implement establishments may qualify for exemption under section 13(a)(2).
######### Sales for resale.

(1)For example, sales of new or used automobiles and trucks, tires, accessories or services, to service stations, repair shops and automobile or truck dealers, where these establishments resell the various items or where they use them in repairing customers' vehicles or in reconditioning used cars for resale, are sales for resale. (Note that a "sale" for purposes of the Act need not be for profit under section 3(k) it includes any "exchange * * * or other disposition".) However, internal transfers of such items between departments within the dealer's establishment, such as transfers of parts from the parts department to the service department of an automobile dealer's establishment, will not be considered sales for resale. Such transfers from one department to another will be disregarded in computing the establishment's sales for determining the applicability of this exemption.
