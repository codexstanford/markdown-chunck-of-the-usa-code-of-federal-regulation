(5) Furthermore, a contractor cannot be relieved from debarment by attempting to shift his/her responsibility to subordinate employees.Decision of the ALJ, SCA 774-775, April 10, 1978;Decision of the Secretary, SCA 176, September 27, 1974;Decision of the Secretary, SCA 275, May 6, 1977. As the Comptroller General has stated in considering debarment under the Davis-Bacon Act, "[n]egligence of the employer to instruct his employees as to the proper method of performing his work or to see that the employee obeys his instructions renders the employer liable for injuries to third parties resulting therefrom. * * * The employer will be liable for acts of his employee within the scope of the employment regardless of whether the acts were expressly or impliedly authorized. * * * Willful and malicious acts of the employee are imputable to the employer under the doctrine of respondeat superior although they might not have been consented to or expressly authorized or ratified by the employer." (Decision of the Comptroller General, B-145608, August 1, 1961.)
