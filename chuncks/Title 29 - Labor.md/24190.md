####### Revocation or modification of subpoenas.

(c)Any person served with a subpoena, whether requiring attendance and testimony (ad testificandum) or for the production of evidence (duces tecum), shall, within 5 days after the date of service of the subpoena, move in writing to revoke or modify the subpoena if the person does not intend to comply. All motions to revoke or modify shall be served on the party at whose request the subpoena was issued. The Commission or the Judge shall revoke or modify the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is otherwise invalid. The Commission or the Judge shall make a simple statement of procedural or other grounds for the ruling on the motion to revoke, modify, or affirm. The motion to revoke or modify, any answer filed, and any ruling on the motion shall become part of the record.
