(f)(1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (c) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.

(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section may at any time request the Secretary to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance.

If the Secretary determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.

(3) If the Secretary denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes the Secretary to have been in error.

The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
