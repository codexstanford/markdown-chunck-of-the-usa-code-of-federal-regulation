######### West,Wal-Mart,

Ownership, sufficient to exercise "control," of course, exists where total ownership is vested in a single person, family unit, partnership, corporation, or other single business organization. Ownership sufficient to exercise "control" exist also where there is more than 50 percent ownership of voting stock. (Seev.264 F. Supp. 168 (W.D. Ark.).) But "control" may exist with much more limited ownership, and, in certain cases exists in the absence of any ownership. The mere ownership of stock in a corporation does not by itself establish the existence of the "control" referred to in the definition. The question whether the ownership in a particular case includes the right to exercise the requisite "control" will necessarily depend upon all the facts in the light of the statutory provisions.
