##### PART 519 - EMPLOYMENT OF FULL-TIME STUDENTS AT SUBMINIMUM WAGES
###### Subpart A - Retail or Service Establishments, and Agriculture
####### ยง 519.6 Terms and conditions of employment under full-time student certificates and under temporary authorization.
######## Applicants requesting authorization for more than 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month without records of student hours worked.

(h)For such an applicant, the permissible proportion under certificate of full-time student hours at subminimum wages to total hours of all employees is based on the "practice" during the preceding twelve-month period of: (1) Similar establishments of the same employer in the same general metropolitan areas in which such establishment is located: (2) similar establishments in the same or nearby communities if such establishment is not in a metropolitan area; or (3) other establishments of the same general character operating in the community or the nearest comparable community. ("Practice" means either the certificate allowances or the proportion between the actual student hours of employment to the total hours of all employees.)

(i) An overestimate of total hours of employment of all employees for a current month resulting in the employment of the full-time students in excess of the hours authorized in paragraph (e), (f), (g), or (h) of this section may be corrected by compensating them for the difference between the subminimum wages actually paid and the applicable minimum under section 6 of the Act for the excess hours. Similarly, if an agricultural employer or a retail or service establishment employer has authorization to employ no more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on any workday but exceeds that number, the excess may be corrected by compensating the additional full-time students for the difference between the subminimum wages actually paid and the applicable minimum under section 6 of the Act. This additional compensation shall be paid on the regular payday next after the end of the period.

(j) Full-time students shall not be permitted to work at subminimum wages for more than 8 hours a day, nor for more than 40 hours a week when school is not in session, nor more than 20 hours a week when school is in session (apart from a full-time student's summer vacation), except that when a full-day school holiday occurs on a day when the establishment is open for business, the weekly limitation on the maximum number of hours which may be worked shall be increased by 8 hours for each such holiday but in no event shall the 40-hour limitation be exceeded. (Note: School is considered to be in session for a student attending summer school.) Whenever a full-time student is employed for more than 20 hours in any workweek in conformance with this paragraph, the employer shall note in his/her payroll records that school was not in session during all or part of that workweek or the student was in his/her summer vacation.

(k) Neither oppressive child labor as defined in section 3(1) of the Act and regulations issued under the Act nor any other employment in violation of a Federal, State or local child labor law or ordinance shall come within the terms of any certificate issued under this subpart.
