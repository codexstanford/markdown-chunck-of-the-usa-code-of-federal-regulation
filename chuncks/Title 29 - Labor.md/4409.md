###### Form of Bonds
####### ยง 453.18 Bonds "individual or schedule in form".
######## Additional bonding.

(c)Section 502(a) neither prevents additional bonding beyond that required by its terms nor prescribes the form in which such additional coverage may be taken. Thus, so long as a particular bond is schedule in form as to the personnel required to be bonded and schedules coverage of these persons in at least the minimum required amount, additional coverage either as to personnel or amount may be taken in any form either in the same or in separate bonds. A bond which provided name or position schedule coverage for all persons required to be bonded under section 502(a), each scheduled person or position being bonded in at least the required minimum amount, would clearly be "schedule in form" within the meaning of section 502(a) regardless of the extent or form of additional schedule or blanket coverage provided in the same bond.
