####### ยง 4041.7 Challenges to plan termination under collective bargaining agreement.
######## Existing collective bargaining agreement.

(b)For purposes of this section, an existing collective bargaining agreement means a collective bargaining agreement that has not been made inoperative by a judicial ruling and, by its terms, either has not expired or is extended beyond its stated expiration date because neither of the collective bargaining parties took the required action to terminate it. When a collective bargaining agreement no longer meets these conditions, it ceases to be an "existing collective bargaining agreement," whether or not any or all of its terms may continue to apply by operation of law.
