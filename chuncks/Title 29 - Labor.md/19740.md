(A) The data upon which judgments are based are scientifically sound and were collected using methods that are sufficiently accurate and precise;

(B) The processes and work practices that were in use when the historical monitoring data were obtained are essentially the same as those to be used during the job for which initial monitoring will not be performed;

(C) The characteristics of the MDA-containing material being handled when the historical monitoring data were obtained are the same as those on the job for which initial monitoring will not be performed;

(D) Environmental conditions prevailing when the historical monitoring data were obtained are the same as those on the job for which initial monitoring will not be performed; and

(E) Other data relevant to the operations, materials, processing, or employee exposures covered by the exception.
