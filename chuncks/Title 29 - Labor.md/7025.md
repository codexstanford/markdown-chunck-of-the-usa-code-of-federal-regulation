(c) Consonant with this legislative history, the courts in interpreting the phrase "employee employed as a seaman" for the purpose of the Act have given it its commonly accepted meaning, namely, one who is aboard a vessel necessarily and primarily in aid of its navigation (v.149 F. 2d 346;v.153 F. 2d 196;v.158 F. 2d 678). In arriving at this conclusion the courts recognized that the term "seaman" does not have a fixed and precise meaning but that its meaning is governed by the context in which it is used and the purpose of the statute in which it is found. In construing the Fair Labor Standards Act, as a remedial statute passed for the benefit of all workers engaged in commerce, unless exempted, the courts concluded that giving a liberal interpretation of the meaning of the term "seaman" as used in an exemptive provision of the Act would frustrate rather than accomplish the legislative purpose (v.132 F. 2d 616;v.supra;v.supra;v.supra).
