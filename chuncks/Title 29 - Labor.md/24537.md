####### e.g.,

(2) However, to retain recognition of independence, the prohibitions against recognition of independence in paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section must not be violated. Further, the rendering of multiple services to a plan by a firm may give rise to circumstances indicating a lack of independence with respect to the employee benefit plan (result in the accountant or firm providing services that are subject to audit procedures as part of the plan's audit), and, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, in determining whether an accountant or accounting firm is not, in fact, independent with respect to a particular plan, the Department will give appropriate consideration to all relevant circumstances, including evidence bearing on all relationships between the accountant or accounting firm and that of the plan sponsor or any affiliate thereof.

(3) Rendering multiple services to a plan by a firm also may involve prohibited transactions under ERISA and requirements to comply with conditions in prohibited transaction exemptions such as prohibited transaction exemption in ERISA section 408(b)(2) for ERISA section 406(a)(1)(C) service provider transactions.
