####### Temporary grounding of suspension strand.

(6)(i) The suspension strand shall be grounded to the existing grounds listed in paragraph (m)(4) of this section when being placed on jointly used poles or during thunderstorm activity.

(ii) Where power crossings are encountered on nonjoint lines, the strand shall be bonded to an existing ground listed in paragraph (m)(4) of this section as close as possible to the crossing. This bonding is not required where crossings are made on a common crossing pole unless there is an upward change in grade at the pole.

(iii) Where roller-type bonds are used, they shall be restrained so as to avoid stressing the electrical connections.

(iv) Bonds between the suspension strand and the existing ground shall be at least No. 6AWG copper.

(v) Temporary bonds shall be left in place until the strand has been tensioned, dead-ended, and permanently grounded.

(vi) The requirements of paragraphs (m)(6)(i) through (m)(6)(v) of this section do not apply to the installation of insulated strand.
