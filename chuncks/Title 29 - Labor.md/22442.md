means a system which aids the equipment operator by sensing (directly or indirectly) the overturning moment on the equipment,load multiplied by radius. It compares this lifting condition to the equipment's rated capacity, and when the rated capacity is reached, it shuts off power to those equipment functions which can increase the severity of loading on the equipment,hoisting, telescoping out, or luffing out. Typically, those functions which decrease the severity of loading on the equipment remain operational,lowering, telescoping in, or luffing in.
