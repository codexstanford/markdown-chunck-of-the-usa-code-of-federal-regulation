(b)The United States Supreme Court has held that the "in commerce" phase of coverage extends "throughout the farthest reaches of the channels of interstate commerce," and covers not only construction work physically in or on a channel or instrumentality of interstate commerce but also construction work "so directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of it, rather than isolated, local activity."
