####### Meek,United States,,Bowe,Judson C. Burns,

Section 11(c) specifically states that "no person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee" because the employee has exercised rights under the Act. Section 3(4) of the Act defines "person" as "one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, business trusts, legal representatives, or any group of persons." Consequently, the prohibitions of section 11(c) are not limited to actions taken by employers against their own employees. A person may be chargeable with discriminatory action against an employee of another person. Section 11(c) would extend to such entities as organizations representing employees for collective bargaining purposes, employment agencies, or any other person in a position to discriminate against an employee. See,v.136 F. 2d 679 (6th Cir., 1943);v.137 F. 2d 37 (3rd Cir., 1943).
