######## Requests after posting of bond or establishment of escrow.

(b)A request for a variance may be submitted at any time. If, after a purchaser has posted a bond or placed money in escrow pursuant to section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, the purchaser demonstrates to the satisfaction of the plan that the criterion in either ยง 4204.13 (a)(1) or (a)(2) is satisfied, then the bond shall be cancelled or the amount in escrow shall be refunded. For purposes of considering a request after the bond or escrow is in place, the words "the year preceding the date of the variance request" shall be substituted for "the date of determination" for the first mention of that term in both ยง 4204.13 (a)(1) and (a)(2). In addition, in determining the purchaser's average net income after taxes under ยง 4204.13(a)(1), for any year included in the average for which the net income figure does not reflect the interest expense incurred with respect to the sale, the purchaser's net income shall be reduced by the amount of interest paid with respect to the sale in the fiscal year following the date of determination.
