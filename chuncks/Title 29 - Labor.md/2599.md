###### Direct threat

(p)means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by auxiliary aids and services, reasonable accommodations, or reasonable modifications in policies, practices and/or procedures. The determination whether an individual with a disability poses a direct threat must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability safely to either:

(1) Satisfy the essential eligibility requirements of the program or activity (in the case of aid, benefits, services, or training); or

(2) Perform the essential functions of the job (in the case of employment). This assessment must be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:

(i) The duration of the risk;

(ii) The nature and severity of the potential harm;

(iii) The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and

(iv) The imminence of the potential harm.
