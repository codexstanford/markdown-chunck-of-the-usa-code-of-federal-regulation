###### ยง 1904.10 Recording criteria for cases involving occupational hearing loss.
####### Do I have to record the hearing loss if I am going to retest the employee's hearing?

(4)No, if you retest the employee's hearing within 30 days of the first test, and the retest does not confirm the recordable STS, you are not required to record the hearing loss case on the OSHA 300 Log. If the retest confirms the recordable STS, you must record the hearing loss illness within seven (7) calendar days of the retest. If subsequent audiometric testing performed under the testing requirements of the ยง 1910.95 noise standard indicates that an STS is not persistent, you may erase or line-out the recorded entry.
