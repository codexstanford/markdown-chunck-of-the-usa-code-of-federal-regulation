Only "natural" evergreens may comprise the principal part of the wreath. The word "natural" qualifies all of the evergreens listed in the section, including "other evergreens." The termmeans that the evergreens at the time they are being used in making a wreath must be in the raw and natural state in which they have been harvested. Artificial evergreens (v.258 F. 2d 197;v.90 P. 2d 289) or evergreens which have been processed as by drying and spraying with tinsel or by other means are not included. It is immaterial whether the natural evergreen used in making a wreath has been cultivated or is a product of the woods or forest.
