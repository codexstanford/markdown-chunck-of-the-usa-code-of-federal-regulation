####### Change in the Beginning of the Workweek
######## ยง 778.302 Computation of overtime due for overlapping workweeks.
######### Application of rule illustrated.

(b)Suppose that, in the example given in ยง 778.301, the employee, who receives $5 an hour and is subject to overtime pay after 40 hours a week, worked 5 hours on Sunday, March 7, 1965. Suppose also that his last "old" workweek commenced at 7 a.m. on Monday, March 1, and he worked 40 hours March 1 through March 5 so that for the workweek ending March 7 he would be owed straight time and overtime compensation for 45 hours. The proposal is to commence the "new" workweek at 7 a.m. on March 7. If in the "new" workweek of Sunday, March 7, through Saturday, March 13, the employee worked a total of 40 hours, including the 5 hours worked on Sunday, it is obvious that the allocation of the Sunday hours to the old workweek will result in higher total compensation to the employee for the 13-day period. He should, therefore, be paid $237.50 (40 x $5 + 5 x $7.50) for the period of March 1 through March 7, and $175 (35 x $5) for the period of March 8 through March 13.
