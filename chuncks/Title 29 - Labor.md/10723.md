####### Split-rail switch.

(7)An electric limit switch operated mechanically by the rollers on the manlift steps. It consists of an additional hinged or "split" rail, mounted on the regular guide rail, over which the step rollers pass. It is springloaded in the "split" position. If the step supports no load, the rollers will "bump" over the switch; if a loaded step should pass over the section, the split rail will be forced straight, tripping the switch and opening the electrical circuit.
