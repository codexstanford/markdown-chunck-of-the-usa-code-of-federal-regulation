(ii) Post its equal opportunity pledge from paragraph (c) of this section on bulletin boards, including through electronic media, such that it is accessible to all apprentices and applicants for apprenticeship;

(iii) Conduct orientation and periodic information sessions for individuals connected with the administration or operation of the apprenticeship program, including all apprentices and journeyworkers who regularly work with apprentices, to inform and remind such individuals of the sponsor's equal employment opportunity policy with regard to apprenticeship, and to provide the training required by paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section; and

(iv) Maintain records necessary to demonstrate compliance with these requirements and make them available to the Registration Agency upon request.
