###### Subpart A - General
####### Engaging in "The Production of Goods for Commerce"
######## ยง 776.17 Employment in a "closely related process or occupation directly essential to" production of goods.
######### Coverage in general.

(a)Employees who are not actually "producing * * * or in any other manner working on" goods for commerce are, nevertheless, engaged in the "production" of such goods within the meaning of the Act and therefore within its general coverage if they are employed "in any closely related process or occupation directly essential to the production thereof, in any State."Prior to the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, this was true of employees engaged "in any process or occupation necessary to the production" of goods for commerce. The amendments deleted the word "necessary" and substituted the words "closely related" and "directly essential" contained in the present law. The words "directly essential" were adopted by the Conference Committee in lieu of the word "indispensable" contained in the amendments as first passed by the House of Representatives. Under the amended language, an employee is covered if the process or occupation in which he is employed is both "closely related" and "directly essential" to the production of goods for interstate or foreign commerce.
