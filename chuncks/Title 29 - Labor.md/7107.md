##### PART 784 - PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT APPLICABLE TO FISHING AND OPERATIONS ON AQUATIC PRODUCTS
###### Subpart B - Exemptions Provisions Relating to Fishing and Aquatic Products
####### Principles Applicable to the Two Exemptions
######## § 784.117 Combinations of exempt work.
######### § 784.136 "Shore" activities exempted under section 13(b)(4).

Section 13(b)(4) provides an exemption from the overtime but not from the minimum wage provisions of the Act for "any employee employed in the canning, processing, marketing, freezing, curing, storing, packing for shipment, or distributing" aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life or any byproducts thereof. Orginally, all these operations were contained in the exemption provided by section 13(a)(5) but, as a result of amendments, first "canning", in 1949, and then the other operations in 1961, were transferred to section 13(b)(4). (See the discussion in §§ 784.102 to 784.105.) These activities are "shore" activities and in general have to do with the movement of the perishable aquatic products to a nonperishable state or to points of consumption (S. Rept. 145, 87th Cong., first session, p. 33).
