(ii)= Vertical height of the center of gravity of a 4,410-lb (2,000-kg) weight in in. (in mm). The weight shall be pulled back so that the height of its center of gravity above the point of impact is:= 4.92 + 0.00190(= 125 +/-0.170) (see Figure C-7).

(iii) The test procedures shall be as follows:

(A) The frame shall be evaluated by imposing dynamic loading from the rear, followed by a load to the side on the same frame. The pendulum swinging from the height determined by paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section shall be used to impose the dynamic load. The position of the pendulum shall be so selected that the initial point of impact on the frame is in line with the arc of travel of the center of gravity of the pendulum. When a quick-release mechanism is used, it shall not influence the attitude of the block;
