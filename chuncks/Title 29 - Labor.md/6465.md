######## § 779.240 Employees "handling * * * or otherwise working on goods."
######### "Handling * * * or otherwise working on goods."

(b)The term "handling * * * or otherwise working on goods" used in section 3(s) is substantially the same as the term used since 1938 in section 3(j) of the Act. Both terms will therefore be considered to have essentially the same meaning. (See part 776 of this chapter, the interpretative bulletin on the general coverage of the Act.) Thus, the activities encompassed in the term "handling or in any other manner working on goods" in section 3(s) are the same as the activities, encompassed in the similar term in section 3(j), by which goods are "produced" within the meaning of the Act. In general, the term "handling * * * or otherwise working on goods" includes employees who sort, screen, grade, store, pack, label, address, transport, deliver, print, type, or otherwise handle or work on the goods. The same will be true of employees who handle or work on "any part of ingredient of the goods" referred to in the discussion of the term "goods" in § 779.107. An employee will be considered engaged in "handling * * * or otherwise working on goods," within the meaning of section 3(s), only if he performs the described activities on goods that "have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person." This requirement is discussed in §§ 779.242 and 779.243.
