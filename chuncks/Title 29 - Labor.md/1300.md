####### Medical reports.

(27)In actions involving injury, illness, disease, death, disability, or physical or mental impairment, doctor, hospital, laboratory and other medical reports, made for purposes of medical treatment, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness, provided that a copy of the report has been filed and served upon the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to object or meet it. The adverse party may not object to the admissibility of the report unless the adverse party files and serves written objection thereto sufficiently in advance of the hearing stating the objections, and the grounds therefor, that the adverse party will make if the report is offered at the time of the hearing. An adverse party may call the author of the medical report as a witness and examine the witness as if under cross-examination.
