(2)For purposes of this section-

(i) Searching is not feasible to the extent that, as a practical matter, it is thwarted by legal or practical lack of access to records, and

(ii) Searching is not affordable to the extent that the cost of searching (including the value of labor) is more than a reasonable fraction of the benefit of the distributee being searched for. In no event would searching need to be pursued beyond the point where the cost equals the value of the benefit.
