(9)All flanges shall be maintained in good condition. When the bearing surfaces become worn, warped, sprung, or damaged they should be trued or refaced. When refacing or truing, care shall be exercised to make sure that proper relief and rigidity is maintained as specified in paragraphs (c) (2) and (5) of this section and they shall be replaced when they do not conform to these subparagraphs and Table O-4, Figure O-30, Table O-5, Figure O-31, Table O-6, Figure O-32, and Table O-8, Figure O-35. Failure to observe these rules might cause excessive flange pressure around the hole of the wheel. This is especially true of wheel-sleeve or adaptor flanges.
