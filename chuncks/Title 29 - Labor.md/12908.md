####### Body protection.

(C)Paragraph (e)(3) of ยง 1910.156 provides an option for fire brigade members to achieve body protection. Fire brigade members may wear a fire-resistive coat in combination with fully extended boots, or they may wear a fire-resistive coat in combination with protective trousers.

Fire-resistive coats and protective trousers meeting all of the requirements contained in NFPA 1971-1975 "Protective Clothing for Structural Fire Fighters," are acceptable as meeting the requirements of this standard.

The lining is required to be permanently attached to the outer shell. However, it is permissible to attach the lining to the outer shell material by stitching in one area such as at the neck. Fastener tape or snap fasteners may be used to secure the rest of the lining to the outer shell to facilitate cleaning. Reference to permanent lining does not refer to a winter liner which is a detachable extra lining used to give added protection to the wearer against the effects of cold weather and wind.
