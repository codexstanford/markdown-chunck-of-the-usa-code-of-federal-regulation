####### with the employer,

(4) Some fringe benefit determinations may require an employer to furnish a specified amount of paid vacation upon completion of a specified length of servicefor example, "one week paid vacation after one year of service with an employer". Under such determinations, only the time spent in performing on commercial work and on Government contract work in the employment of the present contractor need be considered in computing the length of service for purposes of determining vacation eligibility.

(5) Whether or not the predecessor contract(s) was covered by a fringe benefit determination is immaterial in determining whether the one year of service test has been met. This qualification refers to work performed before, as well as after, an applicable fringe benefit determination is incorporated into a contract. Also, the fact that the labor standards in predecessor service contract(s) were only those required under the Fair Labor Standards Act has no effect on the applicable fringe benefit determination contained in a current contract.
