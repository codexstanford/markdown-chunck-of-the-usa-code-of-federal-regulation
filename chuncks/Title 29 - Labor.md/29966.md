######## Requests for categories of records.

(c)Disclosure requests calling for all records falling within a reasonably specific category will be regarded as reasonably described within the meaning of this section and section 552(a)(3) of FOIA if PBGC is reasonably able to determine which records come within the request and to search for and collect them without unduly interfering with PBGC operations. If PBGC operations would be unduly disrupted, the Disclosure Officer will promptly notify the requester and provide an opportunity to confer in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions.
