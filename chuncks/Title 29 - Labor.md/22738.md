(ii) Not stand, sit on, or work from the top or intermediate rail or toeboard, or use any other means/device to raise their working height.

(iii) Not pull the platform out of plumb in relation to the hoisting equipment.

(3) Before employees exit or enter a hoisted personnel platform that is not landed, the platform must be secured to the structure where the work is to be performed, unless the employer can demonstrate that securing to the structure would create a greater hazard.

(4) If the platform is tied to the structure, the operator must not move the platform until the operator receives confirmation that it is freely suspended.
