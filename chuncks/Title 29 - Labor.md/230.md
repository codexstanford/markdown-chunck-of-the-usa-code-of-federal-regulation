####### Determining eligibility for holiday benefits-newly hired employees.

(b)The contractor generally is not required to compensate a newly hired employee for the holiday occurring prior to the hiring of the employee. However, in the one situation where a named holiday falls in the first week of a contract, all employees who work during the first week would be entitled to holiday pay for that day. For example, if a contract to provide services for the period January 1 through December 31 contained a fringe benefit determination listing New Year's Day as a named holiday, and if New Year's Day were officially celebrated on January 2 in the year in question because January 1 fell on a Sunday, employees hired to begin work on January 3 would be entitled to holiday pay for New Year's Day.
