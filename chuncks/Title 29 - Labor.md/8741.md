## Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Labor
### Chapter XIV - Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
#### PART 1606 - GUIDELINES ON DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF NATIONAL ORIGIN
##### ยง 1606.7 Speak-English-only rules.
###### When applied at all times.

(a)A rule requiring employees to speak only English at all times in the workplace is a burdensome term and condition of employment. The primary language of an individual is often an essential national origin characteristic. Prohibiting employees at all times, in the workplace, from speaking their primary language or the language they speak most comfortably, disadvantages an individual's employment opportunities on the basis of national origin. It may also create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation and intimidation based on national origin which could result in a discriminatory working environment.Therefore, the Commission will presume that such a rule violates title VII and will closely scrutinize it.
