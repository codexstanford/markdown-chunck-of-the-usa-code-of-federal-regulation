####### Type A

means cohesive soils with an unconfined compressive strength of 1.5 ton per square foot (tsf) (144 kPa) or greater. Examples of cohesive soils are: clay, silty clay, sandy clay, clay loam and, in some cases, silty clay loam and sandy clay loam. Cemented soils such as caliche and hardpan are also considered Type A. However, no soil is Type A if:

(i) The soil is fissured; or

(ii) The soil is subject to vibration from heavy traffic, pile driving, or similar effects; or

(iii) The soil has been previously disturbed; or

(iv) The soil is part of a sloped, layered system where the layers dip into the excavation on a slope of four horizontal to one vertical (4H:1V) or greater; or

(v) The material is subject to other factors that would require it to be classified as a less stable material.
