####### Access gates/doors.

(8)If installed, access gates/doors of all types (including swinging, sliding, folding, or other types) must:

(i) Not swing outward. If due to the size of the personnel platform, such as a 1-person platform, it is infeasible for the door to swing inward and allow safe entry for the platform occupant, then the access gate/door may swing outward.

(ii) Be equipped with a device that prevents accidental opening.

(9) Headroom must be sufficient to allow employees to stand upright in the platform.

(10) In addition to the use of hard hats, employees must be protected by overhead protection on the personnel platform when employees are exposed to falling objects. The platform overhead protection must not obscure the view of the operator or platform occupants (such as wire mesh that has up toinch openings), unless full protection is necessary.

(11) All edges exposed to employee contact must be smooth enough to prevent injury.

(12) The weight of the platform and its rated capacity must be conspicuously posted on the platform with a plate or other permanent marking.
