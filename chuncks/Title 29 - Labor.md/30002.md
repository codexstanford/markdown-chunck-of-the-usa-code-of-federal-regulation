######## Commercial use requesters.

(1)(i) When records are requested for commercial use, PBGC will assess charges, as provided in this subpart, for the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Fees for search and review may be charged even if the record searched for is not found or if, after it is found, it is determined that the request to inspect it may be denied under section 552(b) of FOIA and this part.

(ii) A "commercial use" request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. PBGC's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis dependent upon on the requester's intended use of the information. PBGC will notify requesters of their placement in this category.
