####### When notice to submitters is required.

(c)(1) The FMCS will promptly notify the submitter in writing whenever such confidential commercial information is requested under the FOIA and the Agency determines that it may be required to disclose the information, provided:

(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

(ii) The FMCS has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet made that determination.

(2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the Agency may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.
