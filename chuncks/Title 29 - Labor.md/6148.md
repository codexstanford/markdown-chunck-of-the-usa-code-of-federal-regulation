####### Engaging in "The Production of Goods for Commerce"
######## ยง 776.16 Employment in "producing, * * * or in any other manner working on" goods.
######### Activities constituting actual "production" under statutory definition.

(b)It will be noted that the actual productive work described in this portion of the definition of "produced" includes not only the work involved in making the products of mining, manufacturing, or processing operations, but also includes "handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on" goods. This is so, regardless of whether the goods are to be further processed or are so-called "finished goods." The Supreme Court has stated that this language of the definition brings within the scope of the term "production," as used in the Act, "every step in putting the subject to commerce in a state to enter commerce," including "all steps, whether manufacture or not, which lead to readiness for putting goods into the stream of commerce," and "every kind of incidental operation preparatory to putting goods into the stream of commerce."
