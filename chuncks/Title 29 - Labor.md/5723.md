####### ยง 552.106 Companionship services.

The term "companionship services" is defined in ยง 552.6. Persons who provide care and protection for babies and young children who do not have illnesses, injuries, or disabilities are considered babysitters, not companions. The companion must perform the services with respect to the elderly person or person with an illness, injury, or disability and not generally to other persons. The "casual" limitation does not apply to companion services.
