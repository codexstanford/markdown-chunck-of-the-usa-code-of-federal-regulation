####### ยง 503.1 Scope and purpose.
######## Consultation standard.

(a)Section 214(c)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(1), requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult with appropriate agencies before authorizing the classification of aliens as H-2B workers. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii)(D) recognize the Secretary of Labor as the appropriate authority with whom DHS consults regarding the H-2B program, and recognize the Secretary of Labor's authority in carrying out the Secretary of Labor's consultative function to issue regulations regarding the issuance of temporary labor certifications. DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iv) provide that an employer's petition to employ nonimmigrant workers on H-2B visas for temporary non-agricultural employment in the United States (U.S.), except for Guam, must be accompanied by an approved temporary labor certification from the Secretary of Labor. The temporary labor certification reflects a determination by the Secretary that:

(1) There are not sufficient U.S. workers who are qualified and who will be available to perform the temporary services or labor for which an employer desires to hire foreign workers; and

(2) The employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed.
