####### Change in the Beginning of the Workweek
######## ยง 778.302 Computation of overtime due for overlapping workweeks.
######### General rule.

(a)When the beginning of the workweek is changed, if the hours which fall within both "old" and "new" workweeks as explained in ยง 778.301 are hours in which the employee does no work, his statutory compensation for each workweek is, of course, determinable in precisely the same manner as it would be if no overlap existed. If, on the other hand, some of the employee's working time falls within hours which are included in both workweeks, the Department of Labor, as an enforcement policy, will assume that the overtime requirements of section 7 of the Act have been satisfied if computation is made as follows:

(1) Assume first that the overlapping hours are to be counted as hours worked only in the "old" workweek and not in the new; compute straight time and overtime compensation due for each of the 2 workweeks on this basis and total the two sums.

(2) Assume now that the overlapping hours are to be counted as hours worked only in the new workweek and not in the old, and complete the total computation accordingly.

(3) Pay the employee an amount not less than the greater of the amounts computed by methods (1) and (2).
