(b) It should be observed that the termis very broadly defined. The definition does not limit the term to transportation, or to the "commercial" transactions involved in "trade," although these are expressly included. Neither is the term confined to commerce in "goods." Obviously, "transportation" or "commerce" between any State and any place outside its boundaries includes a movement of persons as well as a movement of goods. And "transmission" or "communication" across State lines constitutes "commerce" under the definition, without reference to whether anything so transmitted or communicated is "goods."
