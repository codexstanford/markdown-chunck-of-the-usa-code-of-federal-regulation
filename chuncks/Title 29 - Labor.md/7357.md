####### ยง 801.14 Exemption for employers providing security services.
######## prospective employee

(2) The termgenerally refers to an individual who is not currently employed by and who is being considered for employment by an employer. However, the term "prospective employee" also includes current employees under circumstances similar to those discussed in paragraph (d) of ยง 801.13 of this part, i.e., if the employee was initially hired for a position which was not within the exemption provided by section 7(e) of the Act, and subsequently applies for, and is under consideration for, transfer to a position for which pre-employment testing is permitted. Thus, for example, a security guard may be hired for a job outside the scope of the exemption's provisions for pre-employment polygraph testing, such as a position at a supermarket. If subsequently this guard is under consideration for transfer or promotion to a job at a nuclear power plant, this currently-employed individual would be considered to be a "prospective employee" for purposes of this exemption, prior to such proposed transfer or promotion. However, any adverse action which is based in part on a polygraph test against a current employee who is considered to be a "prospective employee" for purposes of this exemption may be taken only with respect to the prospective position and may not affect the employee's employment in the current position.
