The termincludes workers performing on or in connection with a covered contract whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c), as well as any person working on or in connection with a covered contract and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship or training program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office of Apprenticeship. A worker performs "on" a contract if the worker directly performs the specific services called for by the contract. A worker performs "in connection with" a contract if the worker's work activities are necessary to the performance of a contract but are not the specific services called for by the contract.
