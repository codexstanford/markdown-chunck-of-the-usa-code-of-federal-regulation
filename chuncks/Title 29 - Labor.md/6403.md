It is clear that Congress intended the Fair Labor Standards Act to be broad in its scope. "Breadth of coverage is vital to its mission." (v.339 U.S. 497.) An employer who claims an exemption under the Act has the burden of showing that it applies. (v.330 U.S. 545;v.359 U.S. 290;v.113 F. 2d 52.) Conditions specified in the language of the Act are "explicit prerequisites to exemption." (v.361 U.S. 388.) "The details with which the exemptions in this Act have been made preclude their enlargement by implication." (v.322 U.S. 60;v.349 U.S. 254.) Exemptions provided in the Act "are to be narrowly construed against the employer seeking to assert them" and their application limited to those who come plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit; this restricted or narrow construction of the exemptions is necessary to carry out the broad objectives for which the Act was passed. (v.324 U.S. 490;v.supra;v.supra;v.127 F. 2d 934;v.117 F. 2d 11;v.217 F. 2d 210;v.113 F. 2d 52.)
