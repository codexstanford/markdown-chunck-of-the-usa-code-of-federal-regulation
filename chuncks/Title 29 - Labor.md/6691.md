####### Farming in All Its Branches
######## ยง 780.109 Determination of whether unlisted activities are "farming."
######### Chapman,Durkin,,Fort Mason Fruit Co.,Durkin,

Unlike the specifically enumerated operations, the phrase "farming in all its branches" does not clearly indicate its scope. In determining whether an operation constitutes "farming in all its branches," it may be necessary to consider various circumstances such as the nature and purpose of the operations of the employer, the character of the place where the employee performs his duties, the general types of activities there conducted, and the purpose and function of such activities with respect to the operations carried on by the employer. The determination may involve a consideration of the principles contained in ยง 780.104. For example, fish farming activities fall within the scope of the meaning of "farming in all its branches" and employers engaged in such operations would be employed in agriculture. On the other hand, so-called "bird dog" operations of the citrus fruit industry consisting of the purchase of fruit unsuitable for packing and of the transportation and sale of the fruit to canning plants do not qualify as "farming" and, consequently, employees engaged in such operations are not employed in agriculture. (Seev.214 F. 2d 360 cert. denied 348 U.S. 897;v.214 F. 2d 363 cert. denied, 348 U.S. 897.) However, employees gathering the fruit at the groves are considered agricultural workers because they are engaged in harvesting operations. (For exempt transportation, see subpart J of this part.)
