####### "Canning"
######## ยง 784.145 Preliminary processing by another employer as part of "canning."

If the operations of separate processors are integrated in producing canned seafood products all employees of such processors who perform any part of the described continuous series of operations to accomplish this result would be "employed in the canning of" such products. Moreover, preliminary operations performed in a separately owned processing establishment which are directed toward the particular requirements of a cannery pursuant to some definite arrangement between the operators of the two establishments would generally appear to be integrated with the cannery operations within the meaning of the above principles, so that the employees engaged in the preliminary operations in the separate establishment would be employed in "canning" within the meaning of section 13(b)(4) of the Act. Whether or not integration exists in a specific case of this general nature will depend, of course, upon all the relevant facts and circumstances in such case.
