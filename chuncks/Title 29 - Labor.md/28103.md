######## Incidental benefits.

(9)The PBGC will not pay an optional PBGC form with a death benefit (e.g., a joint-and-50%-survivor annuity) unless the death benefit would be an "incidental death benefit" under 26 CFR 1.401-1(b)(1)(i). If the death benefit would not be an "incidental death benefit," the PBGC may instead offer a modified version of the optional form under which the death benefit would be an "incidental death benefit."
