####### Disabling automatic reclosing.

F.There are two reasons to disable the automatic-reclosing feature of circuit-interrupting devices while employees are performing live-line work:

- To prevent reenergization of a circuit faulted during the work, which could create a hazard or result in more serious injuries or damage than the injuries or damage produced by the original fault;

- To prevent any transient overvoltage caused by the switching surge that would result if the circuit were reenergized.

However, due to system stability considerations, it may not always be feasible to disable the automatic-reclosing feature.
