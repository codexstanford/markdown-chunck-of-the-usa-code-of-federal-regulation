## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Labor
### PART 11 - DEPARTMENT OF LABOR NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA) COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES
#### Subpart B - Administrative Procedures
##### ยง 11.10 Identification of agency actions.
###### Other Departmental actions.

(c)Certain actions taken to implement other Department of Labor programs will normally qualify for categorical exclusion from NEPA requirements. These matters are excluded because the possibility of environmental impact is remote. However, classification as a categorical exclusion does not prohibit or release an agency from preparing an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement when the agency determines it to be appropriate. These actions include:

(1) Office of Workforce Investment activities and related placement, counseling, recruitment, information, testing, certification and associated actions;

(2) Apprenticeship activities and related certification and technical assistance actions;

(3) Training activities, other than Job Corps, including work experience, classroom training and public service employment;

(4) Unemployment insurance, trade adjustment assistance, workers' compensation programs, retirement programs, employee protection programs, and related employees benefit programs or activities involving the replacement or regulation of employee wages;

(5) Wage and hour programs to protect low-income workers, eliminate discriminatory employment practices, prevent curtailment of employment and earnings for certain groups of workers, minimize loss of income due to indebtedness, protect farm and migrant labor and related activities;

(6) Contract compliance programs to ensure equal employment opportunity and related actions;

(7) Labor-management relations activities and activities of labor organizations, employers and their officers or representatives;

(8) Research, evaluation, development and information collection projects related to any of the aforementioned activities;

(9) Labor statistics programs; and

(10) Matters involving personnel policy, procurement policy, freedom of information and privacy policy, and related matters of Departmental management.
