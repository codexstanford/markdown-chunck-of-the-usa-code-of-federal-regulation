(vi)(A) Vent piping shall be constructed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

(B) Where vent pipe outlets for tanks storing Category 1 or 2 flammable liquids, or Category 3 flammable liquids with a flashpoint below 100 &#xB0;F (37.8 &#xB0;C), are adjacent to buildings or public ways, they shall be located so that the vapors are released at a safe point outside of buildings and not less than 12 feet (3.658 m) above the adjacent ground level.
