###### ยง 2200.32 Signing of pleadings and motions.

Pleadings and motions shall be signed by the filing party or by the party's representative. The signature of a representative constitutes a representation by the representative that the representative is authorized to represent the party or parties on whose behalf the pleading is filed. The signature of a representative or party also constitutes a certificate by the representative or party that the representative or party has read the pleading, motion, or other document, that to the best of the representative's or party's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not included for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other document is signed in violation of this rule, such signing party or its representative shall be subject to the sanctions set forth in ยง 2200.101 or ยง 2200.104. A signature by a party representative constitutes a representation by the representative that the representative understands that the rules and orders of the Commission and its Judges apply equally to attorney and non-attorney representatives.
