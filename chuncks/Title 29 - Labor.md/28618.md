####### ยง 4043.30 Liquidation.
######## Examples,Liquidation within a controlled group.

(d)-(1)Plan A's controlled group consists of Company A (its contributing sponsor), Company B, Company Q (the parent of Company A and Company B). Company B represents the most significant portion of cash flow for the controlled group. Company B experiences an unforeseen event that negatively impacts operations and results in an increase in debt. The controlled group liquidates Company B by ceasing all operations, settling its debts, and merging any remaining assets into Company Q. (For purposes of this example, it does not matter under which of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section reporting is triggered). The transaction is to be treated as a tax-free liquidation for tax purposes. Both Company A (Plan A's contributing sponsor) and the plan administrator of Plan A are required to report that Company B will liquidate within the controlled group.
