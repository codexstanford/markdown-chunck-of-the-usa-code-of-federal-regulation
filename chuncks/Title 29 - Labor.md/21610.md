####### Isolated ground return.

(3)In high-power testing, the employer shall provide an isolated ground-return conductor system designed to prevent the intentional passage of current, with its attendant voltage rise, from occurring in the ground grid or in the earth. However, the employer need not provide an isolated ground-return conductor if the employer can demonstrate that both of the following conditions exist:

(i) The employer cannot provide an isolated ground-return conductor due to the distance of the test site from the electric energy source, and

(ii) The employer protects employees from any hazardous step and touch potentials that may develop during the test.
