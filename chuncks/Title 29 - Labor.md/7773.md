######## Foreseeable leave.

(a)In the case of foreseeable leave, if an employee fails to provide certification in a timely manner as required by ยง 825.305, then an employer may deny FMLA coverage until the required certification is provided. For example, if an employee has 15 days to provide a certification and does not provide the certification for 45 days without sufficient reason for the delay, the employer can deny FMLA protections for the 30-day period following the expiration of the 15-day time period, if the employee takes leave during such period.
