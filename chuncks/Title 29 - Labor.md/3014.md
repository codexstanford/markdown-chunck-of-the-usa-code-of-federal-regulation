###### Subsection (e)(1).

(4)In the course of criminal and related law enforcement investigations, cases, and matters, the agency will occasionally obtain information concerning actual or potential violations of law that may not be technically within its statutory or other authority, or it may compile information in the course of an investigation which may not be relevant to a specific prosecution. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain some or all of such information since it can aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies. Moreover, it is difficult to know during the course of an investigation what is relevant and necessary. In this connection, facts or evidence may not seem relevant at first, but later in the investigation, their relevance is borne out.
