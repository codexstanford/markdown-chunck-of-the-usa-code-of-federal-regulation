###### Criteria for Determining Who Must Be Bonded
####### ยง 453.8 Personnel who "handle" funds or other property.
######## Physical contact as criterion of "handling."

(c)Physical dealing with funds or other property is, under the principles above stated, not necessarily a controlling criterion in every case for determining the persons who "handle" within the meaning of section 502(a). Physical contact with cash, checks or similar property generally constitutes "handling." On the other hand, bonding may not be required for office personnel who from time to time perform counting, packaging, tabulating or similar duties which involve physical contact with checks, securities, or other funds or property but which are performed under conditions that cannot reasonably be said to give rise to significant risks with respect to the receipt, safekeeping or disbursement of funds or property. This may be the case where significant risks of fraud or dishonesty in the performance of duties of an essentially clerical character are precluded by the closeness of the supervision provided or by the nature of the funds or other property handled.
