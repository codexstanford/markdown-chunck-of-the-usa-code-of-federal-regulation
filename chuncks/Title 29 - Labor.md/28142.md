######## PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.

(g)(1) In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, except as provided in the next sentence, "bankruptcy filing date" is substituted for "termination date" and "date of plan termination" each place that "termination date" or "date of plan termination" appears in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section. In any case in which an event (such as the death of a participant or beneficiary who was alive on the bankruptcy filing date) that affects who is receiving or will receive a benefit from PBGC has occurred on or before the termination date, PBGC will determine the factors in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) based on the form of benefit that was being paid (or was payable) and the person who was receiving or was entitled to receive the benefit from PBGC as of the termination date. (The case of Participant C in the example below illustrates this exception.)
