######### The rate.

(b)The established basic rate may be a specified rate or a rate which can be derived from the application of a specified method of calculation. For instance, under certain conditions the Regulations permit the use of the daily average hourly earnings of the employee as a basis for computing daily overtime.Thus, a method rather than a specific rate is authorized. Also, under certain conditions, the cost of a single meal a day furnished to employees may be excluded from the computation of overtime pay.It is the exclusion of the cost of the meals that is authorized and each employee's rate of pay, whatever it may be-an hourly rate, a piece rate or a salary-is his basic rate.
