####### In general.

(a)(1) The FMCS will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:

(i) Commercial use requesters;

(ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and

(iii) All other requesters.

(2) Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. The Agency will consider requests for fee waivers in accordance with the requirements in subsection (k) of the FOIA. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the FMCS may contact a requester for additional information. The Agency is to conduct searches, review, and duplication in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The FMCS ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States, or by another method as determined by the Agency.
