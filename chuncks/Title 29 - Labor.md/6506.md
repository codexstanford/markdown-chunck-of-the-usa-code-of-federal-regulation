(b) Under this test, employees in the warehouse and central offices of chainstore systems have not been exempt prior to, and their nonexempt status is not changed by, the 1961 amendments. Typically, chain-store organizations are merchandising institutions of a hybrid retail-wholesale nature, whose wholesale functions are performed through their warehouses and central offices and similar establishments which distribute to or serve the various retail outlets. Such central establishments clearly cannot qualify as exempt establishments. (v.324 U.S. 490;v.286 F. 2d 109 (CA-5).) The employees working there are not "employed by" any single exempt establishment of the business; they are, rather, "employed by" an organization of a number of such establishments. Their status obviously differs from that of employees of an exempt retail or service establishment, working in a warehouse operated by and servicing such establishment exclusively, who are exempt as employees "employed by" the exempt establishment regardless of whether or not the warehouse operation is conducted in the same building as the selling or servicing activities.
