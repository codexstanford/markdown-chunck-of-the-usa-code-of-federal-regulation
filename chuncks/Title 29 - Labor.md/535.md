###### Tipped employees.

(b)(1) As provided in ยง 10.2, a covered worker employed in an occupation in which he or she receives tips is a "tipped employee" when he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. Only tips actually retained by the employee after any tip pooling may be counted in determining whether the person is a "tipped employee" and in applying the provisions of section 3 of the Executive Order. An employee may be a "tipped employee" regardless of whether the employee is employed full time or part time so long as the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. An employee who does not receive more than $30 a month in tips customarily and regularly is not a tipped employee for purposes of the Executive Order and must receive the full minimum wage in section 2 of the Executive Order without any credit for tips received under the provisions of section 3.
