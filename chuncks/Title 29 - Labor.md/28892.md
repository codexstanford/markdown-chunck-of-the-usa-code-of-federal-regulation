For a plan to which this subpart applies, this subpart describes what the plan must do upon plan termination if it elects to use the missing participants program for missing participants and beneficiaries who are entitled to distributions. This subpart applies to a plan only if it is a single-employer defined benefit plan that-

(2) Terminates and closes out with sufficient assets to satisfy all liabilities with respect to employees and their beneficiaries.
