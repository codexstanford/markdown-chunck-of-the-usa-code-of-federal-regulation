####### Requests for briefs.

(a)The Commission ordinarily will request the parties to file briefs on issues before the Commission. After briefs are requested, a party may, instead of filing a brief, file a letter setting forth its arguments or a letter stating that it will rely on its petition for discretionary review or previous brief. A party not intending to file a brief shall notify the Commission in writing within the applicable time for filing briefs and shall serve a copy on all other parties. The provisions of this section apply to the filing of briefs and letters filed in lieu of briefs.
