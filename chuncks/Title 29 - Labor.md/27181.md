(d)-(1)To the extent coverage under a group health plan consists of group health insurance coverage, the plan may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the plan requires the health insurance issuer offering the coverage to report the information required by this section in compliance with this subpart pursuant to a written agreement. Accordingly, if a health insurance issuer and a group health plan sponsor enter into a written agreement under which the issuer agrees to provide the information required under paragraph (a) of this section in compliance with this section, and the issuer fails to do so, then the issuer, but not the plan, violates the reporting requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the relevant information.
