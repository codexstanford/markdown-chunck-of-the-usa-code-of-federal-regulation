####### Bona fide group or association of employers.

(b)For purposes of Title I of the Act and this chapter, a bona fide group or association of employers capable of establishing a group health plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan shall include a group or association of employers that meets the following requirements:

(1) The primary purpose of the group or association may be to offer and provide health coverage to its employer members and their employees; however, the group or association also must have at least one substantial business purpose unrelated to offering and providing health coverage or other employee benefits to its employer members and their employees. For purposes of satisfying the standard of this paragraph (b)(1), as a safe harbor, a substantial business purpose is considered to exist if the group or association would be a viable entity in the absence of sponsoring an employee benefit plan. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), a business purpose includes promoting common business interests of its members or the common economic interests in a given trade or employer community, and is not required to be a for-profit activity;

(2) Each employer member of the group or association participating in the group health plan is a person acting directly as an employer of at least one employee who is a participant covered under the plan,

(3) The group or association has a formal organizational structure with a governing body and has by-laws or other similar indications of formality,

(4) The functions and activities of the group or association are controlled by its employer members, and the group's or association's employer members that participate in the group health plan control the plan. Control must be present both in form and in substance,

(5) The employer members have a commonality of interest as described in paragraph (c) of this section,

(6)(i) The group or association does not make health coverage through the group's or association's group health plan available other than to:

(A) An employee of a current employer member of the group or association;

(B) A former employee of a current employer member of the group or association who became eligible for coverage under the group health plan when the former employee was an employee of the employer; and

(C) A beneficiary of an individual described in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A) or (b)(6)(i)(B) of this section (e.g., spouses and dependent children).

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(6)(i)(B) of this section, coverage may not be made available to any individual (or beneficiaries of the individual) for any plan year following the plan year in which the plan determines pursuant to reasonable monitoring procedures that the individual ceases to meet the conditions in paragraph (e)(2) of this section (unless the individual again meets those conditions), except as may be required by section 601 of the Act.

(7) The group or association and health coverage offered by the group or association complies with the nondiscrimination provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.

(8) The group or association is not a health insurance issuer described in section 733(b)(2) of the Act, or owned or controlled by such a health insurance issuer or by a subsidiary or affiliate of such a health insurance issuer, other than to the extent such entities participate in the group or association in their capacity as employer members of the group or association.
