######## Conclusions.

(ii)In accordance with ยง 4022.22(b)(2), PBGC computes the maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit for Participants A, B, and D and for the spouse of Participant C based on the $4,125.00 amount determined under ยง 4022.22(a)(2) for 2007. (The gross-income-based limitation in ยง 4022.22(a)(1) does not apply to any of these participants.)

(A) Participant A's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $3,759.53 [$4,125.00 x .93 (7% reduction for a benefit starting at age 64) x .98 (2% reduction for a certain-and-continuous annuity with 4 years remaining in the certain period)].

(B) Participant B's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $2,673.00 [$4,125.00 x .72 (28% reduction for a benefit starting at age 61) x .90 (10% reduction due to the 50% joint-and-survivor feature)].

(C) Participant C's spouse's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $2,351.25 [$4,125.00 x .57 (43% reduction for a benefit starting at age 58; no reduction for the form of benefit because the spouse's survivor benefit is a straight-life annuity)]. Because that amount exceeds the spouse's $1,500 monthly survivor benefit, the spouse's benefit is not reduced by the maximum guaranteeable benefit limitation.

(D) Participant D's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $3,258.75 [$4,125.00 x .79 (21% reduction for a benefit starting at age 62)].
