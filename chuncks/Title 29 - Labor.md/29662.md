If PBGC approves the Board of Trustees' application for partition, PBGC will issue a notice to affected participants and beneficiaries whose benefits will be transferred to the successor plan no later than 14 days after it issues the order of partition.

Your plan's Summary Plan Description ("SPD") will include information on the procedures for claiming benefits, which will apply to both the original and successor plans until the Plan provides you a new SPD. You also have the legal right to request documents from the original plan to help you understand the partition and your rights such as:

- The plan document, trust agreement, and other documents governing the Plan (e.g., collective bargaining agreements);

- The latest SPD and summaries of material modification;

- The Plan's Form 5500 annual reports, including audited financial statements, filed with the U.S. Department of Labor during the last six years;

- The Plan's annual funding notices for the last six years;

- Actuarial reports (including reports submitted in support of the application for partition) furnished to the Plan within the last six years;

- The Plan's current rehabilitation plan, including contribution schedules; and

- Any quarterly, semi-annual or annual financial reports prepared for the Plan by an investment manager, fiduciary or other advisor and furnished to the Plan within the last six years.

If your benefits are transferred to the successor plan, you will be furnished a successor plan SPD within 120 days of the partition; and the plan document, trust agreement, and other documents governing the successor plan will be available for review following the partition.
