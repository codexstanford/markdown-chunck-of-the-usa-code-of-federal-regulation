###### Complex track.

(2)In unusual circumstances, it may not be possible for the agency to reach a determination within 20 business days. When additional time is needed to respond to the initial request, the Commission shall notify the requester in writing within the 20 business day period, describe the circumstances causing the delay, and indicate the anticipated date for a substantive response that may not exceed 10 additional business days, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

(i) Unusual circumstances that may warrant delay include:

(A) The need to search for and collect the requested records from facilities that are separate from the office processing the request;

(B) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are requested in a single request;

(C) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter interest in the request; and

(D) The need to consult with the submitter of the records being requested.

(ii) With respect to a request for which a written notice has extended the time limit by 10 additional business days, if the Commission determines that it cannot make a response determination within that additional 10 business day period, the requester will be notified and provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the extended time limit, or an opportunity to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. See ยง 2702.10 for fee adjustments applicable to processing time delays.
