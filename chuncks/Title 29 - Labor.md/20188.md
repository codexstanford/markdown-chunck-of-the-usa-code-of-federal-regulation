####### Multiple container systems.

(i)(1) Valves in the assembly of multiple container systems shall be arranged so that replacement of containers can be made without shutting off the flow of gas in the system. This provision is not to be construed as requiring an automatic changeover device.

(2) Heaters shall be equipped with an approved regulator in the supply line between the fuel cylinder and the heater unit. Cylinder connectors shall be provided with an excess flow valve to minimize the flow of gas in the event the fuel line becomes ruptured.

(3) Regulators and low-pressure relief devices shall be rigidly attached to the cylinder valves, clyinders, supporting standards, the building walls, or otherwise rigidly secured, and shall be so installed or protected from the elements.
