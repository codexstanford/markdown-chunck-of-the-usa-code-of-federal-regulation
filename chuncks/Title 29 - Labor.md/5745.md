######### ยง 553.25 Conditions for use of compensatory time ("reasonable period", "unduly disrupt").

(a) Section 7(o)(5) of the FLSA provides that any employee of a public agency who has accrued compensatory time and requested use of this compensatory time, shall be permitted to use such time off within a "reasonable period" after making the request, if such use does not "unduly disrupt" the operations of the agency. This provision, however, does not apply to "other compensatory time" (as defined below in ยง 553.28), including compensatory time accrued for overtime worked prior to April 15, 1986.

(b) Compensatory time cannot be used as a means to avoid statutory overtime compensation. An employee has the right to use compensatory time earned and must not be coerced to accept more compensatory time than an employer can realistically and in good faith expect to be able to grant within a reasonable period of his or her making a request for use of such time.
