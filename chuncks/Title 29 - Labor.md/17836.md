##### ยง 1913.10 Rules of agency practice and procedure concerning OSHA access to employee medical records.
###### Physician consultations.

(ii)A written access order need not be obtained where an OSHA staff or contract physician consults with an employer's physician concerning an occupational safety or health issue. In a situation of this nature, the OSHA physician may conduct on-site evaluation of employee medical records in consultation with the employer's physician, and may make necessary personal notes of his or her findings. No employee medical records, however, shall be taken off-site in the absence of a written access order or the specific written consent of an employee, and no notes of personally identifiable employee medical information made by the OSHA physician shall leave his or her control without the permission of the OSHA Medical Records Officer.
