###### Subpart A - Retail or Service Establishments, and Agriculture
####### ยง 519.6 Terms and conditions of employment under full-time student certificates and under temporary authorization.

(a) A full-time student certificate will not be issued for a period longer than 1 year, nor will it be issued retroactively. It shall specify its effective and expiration dates. A copy of the certificate shall be posted during its effective period in a conspicuous place or places in the establishment or at the farm readily visable to all employees, for example, adjacent to the time clock or on the bulletin board used for notices to the employees. If temporary authorization is in effect under paragraph (a) of ยง 519.4 of this subpart, a notice thereof shall be similarly posted during the effective period of such authorization.

(b) Full-time students may not be employed under a certificate at less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act.

(c) For retail or service establishment employers or agricultural employers, the allowable extent of full-time student employment under certificates varies depending on whether: (1) The employer proposes to employ no more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on any workday, (2) the applicant requests authority for not more than 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month, or (3) the applicant requests authority for more than 10 percent of the total hours during any month. (For agricultural employers, the month of full-time student certificated employment may vary somewhat from the month in a previous year on which the certificate is based, depending on seasonal factors.)
