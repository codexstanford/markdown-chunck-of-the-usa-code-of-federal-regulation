####### Combination of withdrawn employer with contributing employer.

(d)If a withdrawn employer merges or otherwise combines with an employer that has an obligation to contribute to the plan from which the first employer withdrew, the combined entity is the eligible employer, and the rules of ยง 4207.5 shall be applied-

(1) By subtracting from the measurement period contribution base units the contribution base units for which the non-withdrawn portion of the employer was obligated to contribute in the last plan year ending prior to the combination;

(2) By determining the base year contribution base units solely by reference to the contribution base units of the withdrawn portion of the employer; and

(3) By using the date of the combination, rather than the date of resumption of covered operations, to begin the measurement period.
