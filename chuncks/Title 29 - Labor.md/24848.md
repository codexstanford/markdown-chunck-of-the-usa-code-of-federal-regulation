######## Example.

(e)A welfare plan which is funded entirely with insurance contracts and which meets all the requirements of exemption under ยง 2520.104-20 except that it covers 100 or more participants at the beginning of the plan year is not exempt from the annual reporting requirements under ยง 2520.104-20, but is exempt from certain reporting requirements under ยง 2520.104-44. Under the latter section, such a welfare plan should file Form 5500, including Schedule A "Insurance Information." However, the plan is not required to engage an independent qualified public accountant and need not complete certain items on form 5500.
