####### Principles for Computing Overtime Pay Based on the "Regular Rate"
######## ยง 778.110 Hourly rate employee.
######### Earnings at hourly rate exclusively.

(a)If the employee is employed solely on the basis of a single hourly rate, the hourly rate is the "regular rate." For overtime hours of work the employee must be paid, in addition to the straight time hourly earnings, a sum determined by multiplying one-half the hourly rate by the number of hours worked in excess of 40 in the week. Thus a $12 hourly rate will bring, for an employee who works 46 hours, a total weekly wage of $588 (46 hours at $12 plus 6 at $6). In other words, the employee is entitled to be paid an amount equal to $12 an hour for 40 hours and $18 an hour for the 6 hours of overtime, or a total of $588.
