(e)(1) The termfor violations in section 3(a) of the Act is the same term as contained in the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, and therefore, the same principles are applied under both Acts. An officer of a corporation who actively directs and supervises the contract performance, including employment policies and practices and the work of the employees working on the contract, is a party responsible and liable for the violations, individually and jointly with the company (Decision of the Hearing Examiner, PC-946, January 21, 1965, affirmed by the Administrator June 8, 1965;Decision of the Hearing Examiner, PC-790, September 28, 1965).
