####### Carcinogenicity of metabolites.,in vivo,in vitro,in vivo

(k)A substance which is metabolized by mammals to yield one or more potential occupational carcinogens will itself be identified and classified as a potential occupational carcinogen, whether or not there is direct evidence that it induces tumors in humans or experimental animals. Evidence for such metabolism will normally be derived fromstudies in mammals. In appropriate circumstances, evidence may be derived fromstudies of mammalian tissues or fractions thereof. Arguments that evidence frommetabolic studies in mammals is not relevant to the inference of carcinogenic hazard to humans will be considered only if such evidence meets the criteria set forth in ยง 1990.144(c).
