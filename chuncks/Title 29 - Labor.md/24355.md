###### Extensions of response time in unusual circumstances.

(b)In unusual circumstances, the Commission may extend the time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section by not more than 10 working days. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall notify the requester in writing of the extension, the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected. "Unusual circumstances" exists, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, when there is a need to:

(1) Search for and collect the requested records from one of OSHRC's regional offices or off-site storage facilities;

(2) Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; or

(3) Consult, with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.
