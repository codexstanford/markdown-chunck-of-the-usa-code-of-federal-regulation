##### ยง 37.85 Are there any other circumstances in which the Director will send a complaint to another authority?

Yes. The Director refers complaints to other agencies in the following circumstances:

(a) Where the complaint alleges discrimination based on age, and the complaint falls within the jurisdiction of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, then the Director must refer the complaint, in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 90.43(c)(3).

(b) Where the only allegation in the complaint is a charge of individual employment discrimination that is covered both by WIA or this part and by one or more of the laws listed below, then the complaint is a "joint complaint," and the Director may refer it to the EEOC for investigation and conciliation under the procedures described in 29 CFR part 1640 or 1691, as appropriate. The relevant laws are:

(1) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e to 2000e-17);

(2) The Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended (29 U.S.C. 206(d));
