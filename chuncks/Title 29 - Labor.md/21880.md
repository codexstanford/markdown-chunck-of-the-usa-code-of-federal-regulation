####### Definitions applicable to this section.

(e)(1) "Agricultural tractor" means a wheel-type vehicle of more than 20 engine horsepower, used in construction work, that is designed to furnish the power to pull, propel, or drive implements. (SAE standard J333a-1970 ("Operator protection for wheel-type agricultural and industrial tractors") defines "agricultural tractor" as a "wheel-type vehicle of more than 20 engine horsepower designed to furnish the power to pull, carry, propel, or drive implements that are designed for agricultural usage." Since this part 1926 applies only to construction work, the SAE definition of "agricultural tractor" is adopted for purposes of this subpart.)

(2) "Industrial tractor" means that class of wheel-type tractors of more than 20 engine horsepower (other than rubber-tired loaders and dozers described in 29 CFR 1926.1001), used in operations such as landscaping, construction services, loading, digging, grounds keeping, and highway maintenance.
