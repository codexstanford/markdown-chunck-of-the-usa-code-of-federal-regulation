###### Introduction
####### ยง 453.1 Scope and significance of this part.
######## Purpose and effect of interpretations.

(b)Interpretations of the Director with respect to the bonding provisions are set forth in this part to provide those affected by these provisions of the Act with "a practical guide * * * as to how the office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it."The correctness of an interpretation can be determined finally and authoritatively only by the courts. It is necessary, however, for the Director to reach informed conclusions as to the meaning of the law to enable him to carry out his statutory duties of administration and enforcement. The interpretations of the Director contained in this part, which are issued upon the advice of the Solicitor of Labor, indicate the construction of the law which will guide him in performing his duties unless and until he is directed otherwise by authoritative rulings of the courts or unless and until he subsequently decides that a prior interpretation is incorrect. However, the omission to discuss a particular problem in this part, or in interpretations supplementing it, should not be taken to indicate the adoption of any position by the Director with respect to such problem or to constitute an administrative interpretation or practice.
