## Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Labor
### Chapter V - Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor
#### Subchapter D - Garnishment of Earnings
##### PART 870 - RESTRICTION ON GARNISHMENT
###### Subpart B - Determinations and Interpretations
####### ยง 870.10 Maximum part of aggregate disposable earnings subject to garnishment under section 303(a).
######## Date wages paid or payable controlling.

(d)The date that disposable earnings are paid or payable, and not the date the Court issues the garnishment order, is controlling in determining the amount of disposable earnings that may be garnished. Thus, a garnishment order in November 1990, providing for withholding from wages over a period of time, based on exemptions computed at the $3.80 per hour minimum wage then in effect, would be modified by operation of the change in the law so that wages paid after April 1, 1991, are subject to garnishment to the extent described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section on the basis of a minimum rate of $4.25 per hour. This principle is applicable at the time of the enactment of any further increase in the minimum wage.
