#### ยง 29.8 Deregistration of a registered program.
##### Deregistration at the request of the sponsor.

(a)The Registration Agency may cancel the registration of an apprenticeship program by written acknowledgment of such request stating the following:

(1) The registration is cancelled at the sponsor's request, and the effective date thereof;

(2) That, within 15 days of the date of the acknowledgment, the sponsor will notify all apprentices of such cancellation and the effective date; that such cancellation automatically deprives the apprentice of individual registration; that the deregistration of the program removes the apprentice from coverage for Federal purposes which require the Secretary of Labor's approval of an apprenticeship program, and that all apprentices are referred to the Registration Agency for information about potential transfer to other registered apprenticeship programs.
