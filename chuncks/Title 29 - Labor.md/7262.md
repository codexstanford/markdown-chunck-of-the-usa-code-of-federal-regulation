(d)The Bureau of the Budget issues periodically a booklet entitled "Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas", which lists and describes these areas in the United States and Puerto Rico. The booklet lists the standard metropolitan statistical areas by name and shows their population according to the latest available decennial census figures as compiled by the Bureau of the Census. The booklet also lists the major cities within each standard metropolitan statistical area and the population of these cities. From time to time, new areas are designated as "standard metropolitan statistical areas" and areas once designated as such are deleted from the area definitions. This booklet may be purchased, for 25 cents, from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
