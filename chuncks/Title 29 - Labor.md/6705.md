######## ยง 780.121 What constitutes "raising" of livestock.
######### NLRB,Tovrea Packing Co.,,Walling,Friend,

The term "raising" employed with reference to livestock in section 3(f) includes such operations as the breeding, fattening, feeding, and general care of livestock. Thus, employees exclusively engaged in feeding and fattening livestock in stock pens where the livestock remains for a substantial period of time are engaged in the "raising" of livestock. The fact that the livestock is purchased to be fattened and is not bred on the premises does not characterize the fattening as something other than the "raising" of livestock. The feeding and care of livestock does not necessarily or under all circumstances constitute the "raising" of such livestock, however. It is clear, for example, that animals are not being "raised" in the pens of stockyards or the corrals of meat packing plants where they are confined for a period of a few days while en route to slaughter or pending their sale or shipment. Therefore, employees employed in these places in feeding and caring for the constantly changing group of animals cannot reasonably be regarded as "raising" livestock (v.111 F. 2d 626, cert. denied 311 U.S. 668;v.156 F. 2d 429). Employees of a cattle raisers' association engaged in the publication of a magazine about cattle, the detection of cattle thefts, the location of stolen cattle, and apprehension of cattle thieves are not employed in raising livestock and are not engaged in agriculture.
