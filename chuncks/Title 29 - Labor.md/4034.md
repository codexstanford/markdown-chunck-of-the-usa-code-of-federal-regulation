###### § 102.181 Administrative and procedural requests referred to Executive Secretary.

During any period when the Board lacks a quorum, administrative and procedural requests that would normally be filed with the Office of the Executive Secretary for decision by the Board prior to the filing of a request for review under § 102.67, or exceptions under §§ 102.46 and 102.69, will be referred to the Executive Secretary for ruling. Rulings by the Executive Secretary, and orders in connection therewith, may not be appealed directly to the Board, but will be considered by the Board if such matters are raised by a party in its request for review or exceptions.
