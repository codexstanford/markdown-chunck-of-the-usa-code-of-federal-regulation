(4)(i) Hand protection shall consist of protective gloves or glove system which will provide protection against cut, puncture, and heat penetration. Gloves or glove system shall be tested in accordance with the test methods contained in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 1976 publication, "The Development of Criteria for Fire Fighter's Gloves; Vol. II, Part II: Test Methods," which is incorporated by reference as specified in ยง 1910.6, (See appendix D to subpart L) and shall meet the following criteria for cut, puncture, and heat penetration:

(A) Materials used for gloves shall resist surface cut by a blade with an edge having a 60&#xB0; included angle and a .001 inch (.0025 cm.) radius, under an applied force of 16 lbf (72N), and at a slicing velocity of greater or equal to 60 in/min (2.5 cm./sec);

(B) Materials used for the palm and palm side of the fingers shall resist puncture by a penetrometer (simulating a 4d lath nail), under an applied force of 13.2 lbf (60N), and at a velocity greater or equal to 20 in/min (.85 cm./sec); and

(C) The temperature inside the palm and gripping surface of the fingers of gloves shall not exceed 135 &#xB0;F (57 &#xB0;C) when gloves or glove system are exposed to 932 &#xB0;F (500 &#xB0;C) for five seconds at 4 psi (28 kPa) pressure.
