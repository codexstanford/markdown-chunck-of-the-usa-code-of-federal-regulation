##### ยง 99.205 Basis for determining Federal awards expended.
###### Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at institutions of higher education.

(c)When loans are made to students of an institution of higher education but the institution does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the year shall be considered Federal awards expended in that year. The balance of loans for previous years is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.
