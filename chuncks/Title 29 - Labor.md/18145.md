####### Procedures for removal of lockout and tags-plus systems.

(i)(1) Before removing any lockout/tags-plus system and restoring the machinery, equipment, or system to use, the employer shall ensure that the authorized employee does the following:

(i) Notifies all other authorized and affected employees that the lockout/tags-plus system will be removed;

(ii) Ensures that all employees in the work area have been safely positioned or removed; and

(iii) Inspects the work area to ensure that nonessential items have been removed and machinery, equipment, or system components are operationally intact.

(2) The employer shall ensure that each lock or tags-plus system is removed by the authorized employee who applied it.

(3) When the authorized employee who applied the lockout/tags-plus system is not available to remove it, the employer may direct removal by another authorized employee, provided the employer developed and incorporated into the lockout/tags-plus program the specific procedures and training that address such removal, and demonstrates that the specific procedures used provide a level of employee safety that is at least as effective in protecting employees as removal of the system by the authorized employee who applied it. After meeting these requirements, the employer shall do the following in sequence:

(i) Verify that the authorized employee who applied the lockout/tags-plus system is not in the facility;

(ii) Make all reasonable efforts to contact the authorized employee to inform him/her that the lockout/tags-plus system has been removed; and

(iii) Ensure that the authorized employee who applied the lock or tags-plus system has knowledge of the removal before resuming work on the affected machinery, equipment, or system.
