(a)Section 7(e) (3)(a) of the Act provides that the regular rate shall not be deemed to include "sums paid in recognition of services performed during a given period if * * * (a) both the fact that payment is to be made and the amount of the payment are determined at the sole discretion of the employer at or near the end of the period and not pursuant to any prior contract, agreement, or promise causing the employee to expect such payments regularly * * *". Such sums may not, however, be credited toward overtime compensation due under the Act.
