######## Single-cause event spread out over multiple dates (Example 3).

(3)(i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section except that the layoffs resulting from the business unit shut down are spread out over several months. Table 1 to paragraph (f)(3) summarizes the applicable calculations:

(ii) A single-cause event occurs on September 1 because that is the first time the applicable percentage exceeds 20 percent. This event must be reported by October 1. The November 1 layoff does not trigger a subsequent single-cause event because the layoff is part of the same single-cause event already timely reported to PBGC. However, they will be considered in the determination of whether an attrition event occurs at year-end as explained in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
