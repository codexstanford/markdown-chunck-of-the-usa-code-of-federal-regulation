##### ยง 37.4 What definitions apply to this part?
###### Recipient

means any entity to which financial assistance under WIA Title I is extended, either directly from the Department or through the Governor or another recipient (including any successor, assignee, or transferee of a recipient), but excluding the ultimate beneficiaries of the WIA Title I-funded program or activity. In instances in which a Governor operates a program or activity, either directly or through a State agency, using discretionary funds apportioned to him or her under WIA Title I (rather than disbursing the funds to another recipient), the Governor is also a recipient. "Recipient" includes, but is not limited to:

(1) State-level agencies that administer, or are financed in whole or in part with, WIA Title I funds;

(2) State Employment Security Agencies;

(3) State and local Workforce Investment Boards;

(4) LWIA grant recipients;

(5) One-Stop operators;

(6) Service providers, including eligible training providers;

(7) On-the-Job Training (OJT) employers;

(8) Job Corps contractors and center operators, excluding the operators of federally-operated Job Corps centers;

(9) Job Corps national training contractors;

(10) Outreach and admissions agencies, including Job Corps contractors that perform these functions;

(11) Placement agencies, including Job Corps contractors that perform these functions; and

(12) Other National Program recipients.

In addition, for purposes of this part, One-Stop partners, as defined in section 121(b) of WIA, are treated as "recipients," and are subject to the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements of this part, to the extent that they participate in the One-Stop delivery system.
