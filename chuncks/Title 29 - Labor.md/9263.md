##### ยง 1620.15 Jobs requiring equal skill in performance.
###### In general.,It must be measured in terms of the performance requirements of the job.,Possession of a skill not needed to meet the requirements of the job cannot be considered in making a determination regarding equality of skill.

(a)The jobs to which the equal pay standard is applicable are jobs requiring equal skill in their performance. Where the amount or degree of skill required to perform one job is substantially greater than that required to perform another job, the equal pay standard cannot apply even though the jobs may be equal in all other respects. Skill includes consideration of such factors as experience, training, education, and ability.If an employee must have essentially the same skill in order to perform either of two jobs, the jobs will qualify under the EPA as jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, even though the employee in one of the jobs may not exercise the required skill as frequently or during as much of his or her working time as the employee in the other job.The efficiency of the employee's performance in the job is not in itself an appropriate factor to consider in evaluating skill.
