(l)(1) If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government prime contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government prime contractor shall report such fact to the contracting officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance, such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof.

(2) Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a contractor (predecessor) or successor (ยง 4.173 of Regulations, 29 CFR part 4), the incumbent prime contractor shall furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor contractors of each such service employee. The contracting officer shall turn over such list to the successor contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract.

(m) Rulings and interpretations of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR part 4.

(n)(1) By entering into this contract, the contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed pursuant to section 5 of the Act.

(2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract pursuant to section 5 of the Act.

(3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.

(o) Notwithstanding any of the clauses in paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section relating to the Service Contract Act of 1965, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Public Law 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business:

(1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical, or mental deficiency or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Service Contract Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of that Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).

(2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Service Contract Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).

(3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in parts 525 and 528 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(p) Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program.

(q) Where an employee engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips, the amount of tips received by the employee may be credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by Section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act to the extent permitted by section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR part 531. To utilize this proviso:

(1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized;

(2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received);

(3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit;

(4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act.
