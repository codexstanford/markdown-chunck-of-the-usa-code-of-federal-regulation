####### ยง 2580.412-6 Determining when "funds or other property" are "handled" so as to require bonding.
######## Physical contact.

(1)Physical contact with cash, checks or similar property generally constitutes "handling". However, persons who from time to time perform counting, packaging, tabulating, messenger or similar duties of an essentially clerical character involving physical contact with funds or other property would not be "handling" when they perform these duties under conditions and circumstances where risk of loss is negligible because of factors such as close supervision and control or the nature of the property.
