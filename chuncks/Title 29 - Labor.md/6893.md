######## ยง 780.717 Determining whether there is employment "by" the establishment.
######### Rutherford Food Corp.,McComb,,U.S.,Silk,

(a) No single test will determine whether a worker is in fact employed "by" a country elevator establishment. This question must be decided on the basis of the total situation (v.331 U.S. 722;v.331 U.S. 704). Clearly, an employee is so employed where he is hired by the elevator, engages in its work, is paid by the elevator and is under its supervision and control.
