######## ยง 779.383 "Hotel" and "motel" exemptions under section 13(b)(8).
######### Hotel and motel establishments engaged in other activities.

(e)The primary function of a hotel or motel is to provide lodging facilities to the public. In addition, most hotels or motels provide food for their guests and many sell alcoholic beverages. These establishments also may engage in some minor revenue producing activities; such as, the operation of valet services offering cleaning and laundering service for the garments of their guests, news stands, hobby shops, the renting out of their public rooms for meetings, lectures, dances, trade exhibits and weddings. The exception provided for "hotels" and "motels" in section 13(b)(8) will not be defeated simply because a "hotel" or a "motel" engages in all or some of these activities, if it is primarily engaged in providing lodging facilities, food and drink to the public.
