###### ยง 4.173 Meeting requirements for vacation fringe benefits.
####### Rate applicable to computation of vacation benefits.

(e)(1) If an applicable wage determination requires that the hourly wage rate be increased during the period of the contract, the rate applicable to the computation of any required vacation benefits is the hourly rate in effect in the workweek in which the actual paid vacation is provided or the equivalent is paid, as the case may be, and would not be the average of the two hourly rates. This rule would not apply to situations where a wage determination specified the method of computation and the rate to be used.

(2) As set forth in ยง 4.172, unless specified otherwise in an applicable fringe benefit determination, service employees must be furnished the required amount of fringe benefits for all hours paid for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week and 2,080 hours per year. Thus, an employee on paid vacation leave would accrue and must be compensated for any other applicable fringe benefits specified in the fringe benefit determination, and if any of the other benefits are furnished in the form of cash equivalents, such equivalents must be included with the applicable hourly wage rate in computing vacation benefits or a cash equivalent therefor. The rules and regulations for computing cash equivalents are set forth in ยง 4.177.
