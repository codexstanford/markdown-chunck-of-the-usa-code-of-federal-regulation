######## Aggregation of requests.

(c)If PBGC reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, PBGC will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. In no case will PBGC aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.
