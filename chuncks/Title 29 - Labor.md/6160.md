###### Subpart A - General
####### Engaging in "The Production of Goods for Commerce"
######## ยง 776.20 "Goods."
######### "Any part or ingredient."

(c)Section 3(i) draws no distinction between goods and their ingredients and in fact defines goods to mean "goods" * * * or any part or ingredient thereof." The fact that goods are processed or changed in form by several employers before going into interstate or foreign commerce does not affect the character of the original product as "goods" produced for commerce. Thus, if a garment manufacturer sends goods to an independent contractor within the State to have them sewn, after which he further processes and ships them in interstate commerce, the division of the production functions between the two employees does not alter the fact that the employees of the independent contractor are actually producing ("working on") the "goods" (parts or ingredients of goods) which enter the channels of commerce.
