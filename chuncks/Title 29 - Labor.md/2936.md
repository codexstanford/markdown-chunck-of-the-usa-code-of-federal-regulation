##### ยง 70.40 Charges assessed for the production of records.
###### Limitations on charging fees.

(4)If a component fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, it shall not assess certain fees except:

(i) If there are unusual circumstances (as that term is defined in ยง 70.25(c)) and the component has provided timely written notice, the component is permitted ten additional days to respond to the request. After the expiration of the ten additional days, the component is no longer permitted to assess search fees or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in ยง 70.38(h) and (i), duplication fees except as described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.

(ii) If there are unusual circumstances (as that term is defined in ยง 70.25(c)), and more than 5,000 pages of documents are necessary to respond to the request, the component may continue to charge assessable fees for as long as it takes to process the request, provided that the component has provided timely written notice and discussed with the requester via telephone, email, or written mail (or made at least three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the pending request.

(iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined in the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C) the agency's failure to comply with any time limits of the FOIA are excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
