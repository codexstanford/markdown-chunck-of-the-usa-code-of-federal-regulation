(7)(i) If a judge orders that a document is due in 40 days, count every calendar day starting the day after that order (day 1) until reaching day 40 (due date). If the receiving Commission office is closed on day 40 (such as on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday), the document would be due the next day the office is open. In other words, if day 40 falls on a Saturday, and the following Monday is a Federal holiday, the document would be due on Tuesday, the day after the holiday.

(ii) If a judge orders that a document is due 14 days before a hearing, count backwards starting the day before the hearing (day 1) until reaching day 14. If the receiving Commission office is closed on day 14 (such as on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday), the document would be due on the last day the office is open before the Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. In other words, if day 14 falls on a Sunday, and the Friday before is a Federal holiday, the document would be due on Thursday, the day before the holiday.
