####### Making estimates over multiple system areas.

The employer need not estimate the heat-energy exposure for every job task performed by each employee. Paragraph (g)(2) of ยง 1926.960 permits the employer to make broad estimates that cover multiple system areas provided that: (1) The employer uses reasonable assumptions about the energy-exposure distribution throughout the system, and (2) the estimates represent the maximum exposure for those areas. For example, the employer can use the maximum fault current and clearing time to cover several system areas at once.
