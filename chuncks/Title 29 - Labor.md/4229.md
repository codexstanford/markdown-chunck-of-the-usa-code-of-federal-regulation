(d)This category includes any labor organization that has chartered a local labor organization or subsidiary body which is within either of the categories discussed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. Under this provision, a labor organization not otherwise subject to the Act, such as one composed of Government employees, would appear to be "engaged in an industry affecting commerce" and, therefore, subject to the Act if it charters one or more local labor organizations which deal with an "employer" as defined in section 3(c).This category includes, among others, a federation of national or international organizations which directly charters local bodies.
