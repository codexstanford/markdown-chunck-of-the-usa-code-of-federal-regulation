##### ยง 4.163 Section 4(c) of the Act.
###### Collective bargaining agreement must be applicable to work performed on the predecessor contract.

(f)Section 4(c) will be operative only if the employees who worked on the predecessor contract were actually paid in accordance with the wage and fringe benefit provisions of a predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement. Thus, for example, section 4(c) would not apply if the predecessor contractor entered into a collective bargaining agreement for the first time, which did not become effective until after the expiration of the predecessor contract. Likewise, the requirements of section 4(c) would not apply if the predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement applied only to other employees of the firm and not to the employees working on the contract.
