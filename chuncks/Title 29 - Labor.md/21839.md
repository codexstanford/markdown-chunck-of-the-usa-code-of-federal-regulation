###### Appendix C to Subpart V of Part 1926 - Protection From Hazardous Differences in Electric Potential
####### Acceptable methods of grounding for employers that do not perform an engineering determination.

2.The grounding methods presented in this section of this appendix ensure that differences in electric potential are as low as possible and, therefore, meet ยง 1926.962(c) without an engineering determination of the potential differences. These methods follow two principles: (i) The grounding method must ensure that the circuit opens in the fastest available clearing time, and (ii) the grounding method must ensure that the potential differences between conductive objects in the employee's work area are as low as possible.

Paragraph (c) of ยง 1926.962 does not require grounding methods to meet the criteria embodied in these principles. Instead, the paragraph requires that protective grounds be "placed at such locations and arranged in such a manner that the employer can demonstrate will prevent exposure of each employee to hazardous differences in electric potential." However, when the employer's grounding practices do not follow these two principles, the employer will need to perform an engineering analysis to make the demonstration required by ยง 1926.962(c).
