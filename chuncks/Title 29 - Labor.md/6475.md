Goods which are purchased or received by the enterprise from within the State will be considered goods which "have moved across State lines" if they have previously been moved across State lines and have not lost their identity as out-of-State goods before they are purchased or received by the enterprise. Also goods which have been assembled within the State after they were moved across State lines but before they are purchased or received by the enterprise will still be regarded as goods which "have moved across State lines." Such goods are still identifiable as goods brought into the State. This is also true in certain cases where goods are processed to some extent without losing their identity as out-of-State goods. For example, out-of-State furniture or television sets which are put together within the State, or milk from outside the State which is pasteurized and bottled within the State, before being purchased or received by the enterprise, are goods which "have moved across State lines." They have already moved across State lines and they retain their out-of-State identity, despite the assembly or processing within the State.
