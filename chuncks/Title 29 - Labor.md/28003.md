####### Projected census data.

(ii)If actual plan census data are not available, a plan may use a projection of plan census data from a date within the plan year. The projection must be consistent with projections used to measure pension obligations of the plan for financial statement purposes and must give a result appropriate for the end of the plan year for these obligations. For example, adjustments to the projection process are required where there has been a significant event (such as a plan amendment or a plant shutdown) that has not been reflected in the projection data.
