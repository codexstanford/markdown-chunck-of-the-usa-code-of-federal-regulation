(4) Wages due workers underpaid on the contract have priority over any assignee of the contractor, including assignments made under the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 203, 41 U.S.C. 15, to funds withheld under the contract, since an assignee can acquire no greater rights to withheld funds than the assignor has in the absence of an assignment. Seev.101 Ct. Cl. 808 (1944);v.178 Ct. Cl. 46, 371 F. 2d 462 (1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 833;v.149 Ct. Cl. 170, 181 F. Supp. 246 (1960);v.208 U.S. 404 (1908). Where employees have been underpaid, the assignor has no right to assign funds since the assignor has no property rights to amounts withheld from the contract to cover underpayments of workers which constitute a violation of the law and the terms, conditions, and obligations under the contract. (Decision of the Comptroller General, B-164881, August 14, 1968; B-178198, August 30, 1973; 56 Comp. Gen. 499 (1977); 55 Comp. Gen. 744 (1976);v.143 Ct. Cl. 154, 163 F. Supp. 846 (1958);v.132 Ct. Cl. 724, 135 F. Supp. 381 (1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 902.)
