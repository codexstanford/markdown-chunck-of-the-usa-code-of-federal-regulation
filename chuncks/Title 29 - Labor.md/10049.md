####### If I receive a variance, may the Assistant Secretary revoke the variance at a later date?

(5)Yes, the Assistant Secretary may revoke your variance if he or she has good cause.

Except in cases of willfulness or where necessary for public safety, the Assistant Secretary will:

(ii) Provide you, your employees, and authorized employee representatives with an opportunity to participate in the revocation procedures.
