####### Dual treatment of working owners as employers and employees

(e). (1) A working owner of a trade or business without common law employees may qualify as both an employer and as an employee of the trade or business for purposes of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, including the requirement in paragraph (b)(2) that each employer member of the group or association participating in the group health plan must be a person acting directly as an employer of one or more employees who are participants covered under the plan, and the requirement in paragraph (b)(6) that the group or association does not make health coverage offered to employer members through the association available other than to certain employees and former employees and their beneficiaries.

(2) The term "working owner" as used in this paragraph (e) of this section means any person who a responsible plan fiduciary reasonably determines is an individual:

(i) Who has an ownership right of any nature in a trade or business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, including a partner and other self-employed individual;

(ii) Who is earning wages or self-employment income from the trade or business for providing personal services to the trade or business; and

(iii) Who either:

(A) Works on average at least 20 hours per week or at least 80 hours per month providing personal services to the working owner's trade or business, or

(B) Has wages or self-employment income from such trade or business that at least equals the working owner's cost of coverage for participation by the working owner and any covered beneficiaries in the group health plan sponsored by the group or association in which the individual is participating.

(3) The determination under this paragraph must be made when the working owner first becomes eligible for coverage under the group health plan and continued eligibility must be periodically confirmed pursuant to reasonable monitoring procedures.
