######## ยง 780.125 Raising of poultry in general.

(a) The term "poultry" includes domesticated fowl and game birds. Ducks and pigeons are included. Canaries and parakeets are not included.

(b) The "raising" of poultry includes the breeding, hatching, propagating, feeding, and general care of poultry. Slaughtering, which is the antithesis of "raising," is not included. To constitute "agriculture," slaughtering must come within the secondary meaning of the term "agriculture." The temporary feeding and care of chickens and other poultry for a few days pending sale, shipment or slaughter is not the "raising" of poultry. However, feeding, fattening and caring for poultry over a substantial period may constitute the "raising" of poultry.
