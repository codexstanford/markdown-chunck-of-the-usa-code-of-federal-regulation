The term "retail" whether it refers to establishments or to the sale of goods or services is susceptible of various interpretations. When used in a specific law it can be defined properly only in terms of the purposes and objectives and scope of that law. In enacting the section 13(a)(2) exemption, Congress had before it the specific object of exempting from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Act employees employed by the traditional local retail or service establishment, subject to the conditions specified in the exemption. (See statements of Rep. Lucas, 95 Cong. Rec. pp. 11004 and 11116, and of Sen. Holland, 95 Cong. Rec. pp. 12502 and 12506.) Thus, the term "retail or service establishment" as used in the Act denotes the traditional local retail or service establishment whether pertaining to the coverage or exemption provisions.
