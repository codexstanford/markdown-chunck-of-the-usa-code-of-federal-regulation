###### Actions requiring environmental assessment.

(2)Several classes of OSHA/MSHA actions normally require the preparation of an environmental assessment prior to determining whether either a finding of no significant impact or an environmental impact statement must be prepared. (However, OSHA or MSHA may proceed to prepare an environmental impact statement, without first preparing an environmental assessment, if it determines such action to be appropriate or necessary, as provided by 40 CFR 1501.3(a)). Actions in this classification include:

(i) Promulgation, modification or revocation of a health standard; and

(ii) Approval or revocation of State plans for the enforcement of safety and health standards (not applicable to MSHA).
