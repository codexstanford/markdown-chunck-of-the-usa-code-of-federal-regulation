###### Cluster of programs

means a grouping of closely related programs that share common compliance requirements. The types of clusters of programs are research and development (R&D), student financial aid (SFA), and other clusters. "Other clusters" are as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the compliance supplement or as designated by a State for Federal awards the State provides to its subrecipients that meet the definition of a cluster of programs. When designating an "other cluster," a State shall identify the Federal awards included in the cluster and advise the subrecipients of compliance requirements applicable to the cluster, consistent with § 99.400(d)(1) and § 99.400(d)(2), respectively. A cluster of programs shall be considered as one program for determining major programs, as described in § 99.520, and, with the exception of R&D as described in § 99.200(c), whether a program-specific audit may be elected.
