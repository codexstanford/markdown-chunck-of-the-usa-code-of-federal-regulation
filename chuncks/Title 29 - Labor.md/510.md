The required contract clause directs, as a condition of payment, that all workers performing work on or in connection with covered contracts must be paid the applicable, currently effective minimum wage under Executive Order 13658 and ยง 10.5. For procurement contracts subject to the FAR, contracting agencies must use the clause set forth in the FAR developed to implement this rule. Such clause will accomplish the same purposes as the clause set forth in Appendix A and be consistent with the requirements set forth in this rule.
