######## Systems to be grounded.

(1)Systems that supply premises wiring shall be grounded as follows:

(i) All 3-wire dc systems shall have their neutral conductor grounded;

(ii) Two-wire dc systems operating at over 50 volts through 300 volts between conductors shall be grounded unless:

(A) They supply only industrial equipment in limited areas and are equipped with a ground detector;

(B) They are rectifier-derived from an ac system complying with paragraphs (g)(1)(iii), (g)(1)(iv), and (g)(1)(v) of this section; or

(C) They are fire-alarm circuits having a maximum current of 0.030 amperes;

(iii) AC circuits of less than 50 volts shall be grounded if they are installed as overhead conductors outside of buildings or if they are supplied by transformers and the transformer primary supply system is ungrounded or exceeds 150 volts to ground;

(iv) AC systems of 50 volts to 1000 volts shall be grounded under any of the following conditions, unless exempted by paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section:

(A) If the system can be so grounded that the maximum voltage to ground on the ungrounded conductors does not exceed 150 volts;

(B) If the system is nominally rated three-phase, four-wire wye connected in which the neutral is used as a circuit conductor;

(C) If the system is nominally rated three-phase, four-wire delta connected in which the midpoint of one phase is used as a circuit conductor; or

(D) If a service conductor is uninsulated;

(v) AC systems of 50 volts to 1000 volts are not required to be grounded under any of the following conditions:

(A) If the system is used exclusively to supply industrial electric furnaces for melting, refining, tempering, and the like;

(B) If the system is separately derived and is used exclusively for rectifiers supplying only adjustable speed industrial drives;

(C) If the system is separately derived and is supplied by a transformer that has a primary voltage rating less than 1000 volts, provided all of the following conditions are met:
