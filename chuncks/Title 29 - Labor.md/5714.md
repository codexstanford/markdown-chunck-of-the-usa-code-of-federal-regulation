######## Katzenbach,McClung,

Congress in section 2(a) of the Act specifically found that the employment of persons in domestic service in households affects commerce. In the legislative history it was pointed out that employees in domestic service employment handle goods such as soaps, mops, detergents, and vacuum cleaners that have moved in or were produced for interstate commerce and also that they free members of the household to themselves to engage in activities in interstate commerce (S. Rep. 93-690, pp. 21-22). The Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare "took note of the expanded use of the interstate commerce clause by the Supreme Court in numerous recent cases (particularlyv.379 U.S. 294 (1964))," and concluded "that coverage of domestic employees is a vital step in the direction of ensuring that all workers affecting interstate commerce are protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act" (S. Rep. 93-690, pp. 21-22).
