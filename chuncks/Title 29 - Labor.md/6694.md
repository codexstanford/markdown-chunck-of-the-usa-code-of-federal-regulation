######### Wirtz,Ti Ti Peat Humus Co.,

Section 3(f) of the Act defines as "agriculture" the "production, cultivation, growing, and harvesting" of "agricultural or horticultural commodities," and employees employed in such operations are engaged in agriculture. In general, within the meaning of the Act, "agricultural or horticultural commodities" refers to commodities resulting from the application of agricultural or horticultural techniques. Insofar as the term refers to products of the soil, it means commodities that are planted and cultivated by man. Among such commodities are the following: Grains, forage crops, fruits, vegetables, nuts, sugar crops, fiber crops, tobacco, and nursery products. Thus, employees engaged in growing wheat, corn, hay, onions, carrots, sugar cane, seed, or any other agricultural or horticultural commodity are engaged in "agriculture." In addition to such products of the soil, however, the term includes domesticated animals and some of their products such as milk, wool, eggs, and honey. The term does not include commodities produced by industrial techniques, by exploitation of mineral wealth or other natural resources, or by uncultivated natural growth. For example, peat humus or peat moss is not an agricultural commodity.v.373 f(2d) 209 (C.A.4).
