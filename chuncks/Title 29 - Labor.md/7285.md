####### The "Enterprise"
######## ยง 794.109 Statutory basis for inclusion of activities in enterprise.

The "enterprise" for purposes of enterprise coverage under section 3(s) and the exemption provision in section 7(b)(3), is defined in section 3(r) (ยง 794.106) in terms of the activities in which it is engaged. All the "related activities" which are "performed * * * by any person or persons for a common business purpose" are included if they are performed "either through unified operation or common control." This is true even if they are performed by more than one person, or in more than one establishment or by more than one corporate or other organizational unit. The definition specifically includes as a part of the enterprise, departments of an establishment operated through leasing arrangements. These statutory criteria are discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.
