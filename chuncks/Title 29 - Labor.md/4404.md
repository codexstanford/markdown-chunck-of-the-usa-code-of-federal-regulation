###### Amount of Bonds
####### ยง 453.15 The meaning of funds handled "during the preceding fiscal year".

The funds handled by personnel required to be bonded and their predecessors during the course of a fiscal year would ordinarily include the total of whatever such funds were on hand at the beginning of the fiscal year plus any items received or added in the form of funds during the year for any reason, such as dues, fees and assessments, trust receipts, or items received as a result of sales, investments, reinvestments, or otherwise. It would not, however, be necessary to count the same item twice in arriving at the total funds handled by personnel during a year. Once an item properly within the category of "funds" had been counted as handled by personnel during a year, there would be no need to count it again should it subsequently be handled by the same personnel during the same year in some other connection.
