####### Petitions for discretionary review.

(b)A party adversely affected or aggrieved by the decision of the Judge may seek review by the Commission by filing a petition for discretionary review with the Executive Secretary at any time following the service of the Judge's decision on the parties but no later than 20 days after the date of docketing of the Judge's report. Service of the filed petition on the other parties and intervenors shall be accomplished in a manner prescribed in ยง 2200.7(c). The earlier a petition is filed, the more consideration it can be given. A petition for discretionary review may be conditional, and it may state that review is sought only if a Commissioner were to direct review on the petition of an opposing party.
