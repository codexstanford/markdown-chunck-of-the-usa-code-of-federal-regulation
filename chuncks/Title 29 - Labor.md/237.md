###### ยง 4.177 Discharging fringe benefit obligations by equivalent means.
####### equivalent fringe benefit,cash equivalent

(3) When a contractor discharges his fringe benefit obligation by furnishing, in lieu of those benefits specified in the applicable fringe benefit determination, other "bona fide" fringe benefits, cash payments, or a combination thereof, the substituted fringe benefits and/or cash payments must be "equivalent" to the benefits specified in the determination. As used in this subpart, the termsandmean equal in terms of monetary cost to the contractor. Thus, as set forth in ยง 4.172, if an applicable fringe benefit determination calls for a particular fringe benefit in a stated amount and the contractor furnished this benefit through contributions in a lesser amount, the contractor must furnish the employee with the difference between the amount stated in the determination and the actual cost of the benefit which the contractor provides. This principle may be illustrated by the example given in ยง 4.175(a)(2).
