## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Labor
### PART 32 - NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF HANDICAP IN PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
#### Subpart C - Accessibility
##### ยง 32.27 Accessibility.
###### Purpose.

(a)A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to qualified handicapped individuals. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped individuals. However, if a particular aid, benefit, service, or training is available in only one location, that site must be made accessible or the aid, benefit, service, or training must be made available at an alternative accessible site or sites. Accessibility requires nonpersonal aids to make the program or activity accessible to mobility impaired persons. Reasonable accommodations, as defined in ยง 32.3, are required for particular handicapped individuals in response to the specific limitations of their handicaps.
