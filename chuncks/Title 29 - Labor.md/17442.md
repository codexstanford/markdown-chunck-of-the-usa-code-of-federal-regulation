####### Respirator selection.

(3)(i) The employer must select appropriate respirators from Table 1 of this section.

(ii) Air-purifying respirators must have filter elements approved by NIOSH for organic vapors or BD.

(iii) When an employee whose job requires the use of a respirator cannot use a negative-pressure respirator, the employer must provide the employee with a respirator that has less breathing resistance than the negative-pressure respirator, such as a powered air-purifying respirator or supplied-air respirator, when the employee is able to use it and if it provides the employee adequate protection.
