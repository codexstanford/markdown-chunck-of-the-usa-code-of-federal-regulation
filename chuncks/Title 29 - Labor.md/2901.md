(c)(1) Where the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of "unusual circumstances," as set forth in the FOIA at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii), and the component determines to extend the time limits on that basis, the component shall, before the expiration of the 20 working day deadline to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. If the component intends to extend the deadline to respond by more than ten working days, the component must:

(i) Provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an alternative time period with the component for processing the request or a modified request;

(ii) Make available to the requester the contact information for the designated FOIA contact and the FOIA Public Liaison to assist the requester; and

(iii) Notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).
