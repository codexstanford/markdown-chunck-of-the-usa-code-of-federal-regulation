(2)Inspection procedure for cranes in regular service is divided into two general classifications based upon the intervals at which inspection should be performed.

The two general classifications are herein designated as "frequent" and "periodic", with respective intervals between inspections as defined below:

(i) Frequent inspection: Daily to monthly intervals.

(ii) Periodic inspection: 1- to 12-month intervals, or as specifically recommended by the manufacturer.
