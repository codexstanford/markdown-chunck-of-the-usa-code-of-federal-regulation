(d)(1) The following documents may be filed within a reasonable time after the time prescribed by these Rules only upon good cause shown based on excusable neglect and when no undue prejudice would result:

(i) In unfair labor practice proceedings, motions, exceptions, answers to a complaint or a backpay specification, and briefs; and

(ii) In representation proceedings, exceptions, requests for review, motions, briefs, and any responses to any of these documents.

(2) A party seeking to file such documents beyond the time prescribed by these Rules must file, along with the document, a motion that states the grounds relied on for requesting permission to file untimely. The specific facts relied on to support the motion must be set forth in affidavit form and sworn to by individuals with personal knowledge of the facts. The time for filing any document responding to the untimely document will not commence until the date a ruling issues accepting the untimely document.
