(a) Section 3(k) of the Act provides that "Sale" or "sell", as used in the Act, "includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition." Since "goods", as defined, includes any part or ingredient of goods (see ยง 779.14), a "resale" of goods includes their sale in a different form than when first purchased or sold, such as the sale of goods of which they have become a component part (v.361 U.S. 388). The Act, in section 3(n), provides one exception to this rule by declaring that "resale", as used in the Act, "shall not include the sale of goods to be used in residential or farm building construction, repair, or maintenance:That the sale is recognized as a bona fide retail sale in the industry." A resale of goods is not confined to resale of the goods as such, but under section 3(k) may include an "other disposition" of the goods in which they are disposed of in a transaction of a different kind; thus the sale by a restaurant to an airline of prepared meals to be served in flight to passengers whose tickets entitle them to a "complimentary" meal is a sale of goods "for resale". (v.264 F 2d 831 (C.A. 4), cert. denied 360 U.S. 934.)
