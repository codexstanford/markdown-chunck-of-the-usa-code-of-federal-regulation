(c) A debt is considered delinquent if it has not been paid by the date specified in the agency's initial demand letter (ยง 20.4), unless satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date, or if, at any time thereafter, the debtor fails to satisfy his obligations under a payment agreement with the Department of Labor, or any agency thereof.
