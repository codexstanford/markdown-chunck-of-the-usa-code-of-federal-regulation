######### Effect of the exclusionary clause.

(d)The exclusionary clause in the definition that excepts "goods after their delivery into the actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer thereof other than a producer, manufacturer, or processor thereof," is intended to protect ultimate consumers other than producers, manufacturers, or processors of the goods in questionfrom the "hot goods" provisions of section 15(a)(1) of the Act.Section 15(a)(1) makes it unlawful for any person "to transport * * * (or * * * ship * * * in commerce * * * any goods" produced in violation of the wage and hours standards established by the Act. (Exceptions are made subject to specified conditions for common carriers and for certain purchasers acting in good faith reliance on written statements of compliance. See footnote 53 to ยง 776.15(a).) By defining "goods" in section 3(i) so as to exclude goods after their delivery into the actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer (other than a producer, manufacturer, or processor thereof) Congress made it clear that it did not intend to hold the ultimate consumer as a violator of section 15(a)(1) if he should transport "hot goods" across a State line.Thus, if a person purchases a pair of shoes for himself from a retail storeand carries the shoes across a State line, the purchaser is not guilty of a violation of section 15(a)(1) if the shoes were produced in violation of the wage or hours provisions of the statute. But the fact that goods produced for commerce lose their character as "goods" after they come into the actual physical possession of an ultimate consumer who does not further process or work on them, does not affect their character as "goods" while they are still in the actual physical possession of the producer, manufacturer or processor who is handling or working on them with the intent or expectation that they will subsequently enter interstate or foreign commerce.Congress clearly did not intend to permit an employer to avoid the minimum wage and maximum hours standards of the Act by making delivery within the State into the actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer who transports or ships the goods outside of the State. Thus, employees engaged in building a boat for delivery to the purchaser at the boatyard are considered within the coverage of the Act if the employer, at the time the boat is being built, intends, hopes, or has reason to believe that the purchase will sail it outside the State.
