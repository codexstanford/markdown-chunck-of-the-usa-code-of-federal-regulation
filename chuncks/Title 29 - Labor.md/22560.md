###### § 1926.1411 Power line safety - while traveling under or near power lines with no load.

(a) This section establishes procedures and criteria that must be met for equipment traveling under or near a power line on a construction site with no load. Equipment traveling on a construction site with a load is governed by § 1926.1408, § 1926.1409 or § 1926.1410, whichever is appropriate, and § 1926.1417(u).

(b) The employer must ensure that:

(1) The boom/mast and boom/mast support system are lowered sufficiently to meet the requirements of this paragraph.

(2) The clearances specified in Table T of this section are maintained.

(3) The effects of speed and terrain on equipment movement (including movement of the boom/mast) are considered so that those effects do not cause the minimum clearance distances specified in Table T of this section to be breached.
