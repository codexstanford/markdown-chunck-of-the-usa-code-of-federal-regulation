###### Subpart A - General
####### Engaging in "The Production of Goods for Commerce"
######## § 776.21 "For" commerce.
######### General principles.

(a)As has been made clear previously, where "goods" (as defined in the Act) are produced "for commerce," every employee engaged in the "production" (as explained in §§ 776.15 through 776.19) of such goods (including any part or ingredient thereof) is within the general coverage of the wage and hours provisions of the Act. Goods are produced for "commerce" if they are produced for "trade, commerce, transporation, transmission, or communication among the several States or between any State and any place outside thereof."Goods are produced "for" such commerce where the employer intends, hopes, expects, or has reason to believe that the goods or any unsegregated part of them will move (in the same or in an altered form or as a part or ingredient of other goods) in such interstate or foreign commerce.If such movement of the goods in commerce can be reasonably anticipated by the employer when his employees perform work defined in the Act as "production" of such goods, it makes no difference whether he himself, or a subsequent owner or possessor of the goods, put the goods in interstate or foreign commerce.The fact that goods do move in interstate or foreign commerce is strong evidence that the employer intended, hoped, expected, or had reason to believe that they would so move.
