## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Labor
### PART 71 - PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY AND ACCESS TO RECORDS UNDER THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
#### Subpart B - Exemption of Records Systems Under the Privacy Act
##### ยง 71.52 Specific exemptions pursuant to subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act.
###### Subsection (c)(3).

(1)The release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those permitted under the routine uses published for this system of records, would enable the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential civil case to determine whether he or she is the subject of investigation, to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation and the information obtained, and to determine the identity of witnesses or informants. Such access to investigative information would, accordingly, present a serious impediment to the investigation. In addition, disclosure of the accounting would constitute notice to the individual of the existence of a record even though such notice requirement under subsection (f)(1) is specifically exempted for this system of records.
