####### Steam supply system.

(a)(1) The employer shall ensure that the vessel's steam piping system, including hoses, is designed to safely handle the working pressure prior to supplying steam from an outside source. The employer shall obtain a written or oral determination from a responsible vessel's representative, a contractor, or any other person who is qualified by training, knowledge, or experience to make such determination that the working pressure of the vessel's steam piping system is safe.

(2) The employer shall ensure that each outside steam supply connected to a vessel's steam piping system meets the following requirements:

(i) A pressure gauge and a relief valve are installed at the point where the temporary steam hose joins the vessel's steam piping system;

(ii) Each relief valve is set to relieve excess steam at, and is capable of relieving steam at, a pressure that does not exceed the safe working pressure of the system in its present condition;

(iii) There are no means of inadvertently disconnecting any relief valve from the system that it protects;

(iv) Each pressure gauge and relief valve is legible and located so it is visible and readily accessible; and

(v) Each relief valve is positioned so it is not likely to cause injury if steam is released.
