##### Contract suspension/Contract termination/Contractor debarment.

(d)In the event of a failure to pay any worker all or part of the wages due under Executive Order 14026 or 29 CFR part 23, or a failure to comply with any other term or condition of Executive Order 14026 or 29 CFR part 23, the contracting agency may on its own action or after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment, advance or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the contractor in default with any additional cost. A breach of the contract clause may be grounds for debarment as a contractor and subcontractor as provided in 29 CFR 23.520.
