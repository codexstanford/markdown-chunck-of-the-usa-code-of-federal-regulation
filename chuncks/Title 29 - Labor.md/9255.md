##### ยง 1620.13 "Equal Work" - What it means.
###### In general.

(a)The EPA prohibits discrimination by employers on the basis of sex in the wages paid for "equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort and responsibility and which are performed under similar working conditions * * *." The word "requires" does not connote that an employer must formally assign the equal work to the employee; the EPA applies if the employer knowingly allows the employee to perform the equal work. The equal work standard does not require that compared jobs be identical, only that they be substantially equal.
