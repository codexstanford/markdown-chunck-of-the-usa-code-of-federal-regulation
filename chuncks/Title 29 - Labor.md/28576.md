(ii) To prevent duplicative reporting (to ensure that the participants who triggered a single-cause reporting requirement do not also trigger an attrition event), the 230 participants who triggered that single-cause reporting requirement are not taken into account for purposes of determining whether an attrition event occurred. This is accomplished by increasing the year-end count by 230. Therefore, the applicable percentage for the attrition determination is 83 percent ((600 + 230)/1,000 = .83). Because 83 percent is greater than 80 percent, an attrition event has not occurred.
