####### Can an establishment include more than one physical location?

(2)Yes, but only under certain conditions. An employer may combine two or more physical locations into a single establishment only when:

(i) The employer operates the locations as a single business operation under common management;

(ii) The locations are all located in close proximity to each other; and

(iii) The employer keeps one set of business records for the locations, such as records on the number of employees, their wages and salaries, sales or receipts, and other kinds of business information. For example, one manufacturing establishment might include the main plant, a warehouse a few blocks away, and an administrative services building across the street.
