###### ยง 4262.12 Payment of special financial assistance.
####### Manner of payment.

(g)The payment of special financial assistance to a plan will be made by PBGC in a lump sum or substantially so and is not a loan subject to repayment obligations. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following payment obligations apply:

(1) Special financial assistance is subject to recalculation or adjustment to correct a clerical or arithmetic error. PBGC will, and plans must, make payments as needed to reflect any such recalculation or adjustment in a timely manner.

(2) If PBGC determines that a payment for special financial assistance to a plan exceeded the amount to which the plan was entitled, any excess payment constitutes a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within 90 calendar days after demand, PBGC may reduce the debt by any action permitted by Federal statute. Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, PBGC will charge interest and other amounts permitted on an overdue debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900 through 999). The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.
