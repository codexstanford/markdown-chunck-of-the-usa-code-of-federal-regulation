####### ยง 4903.11 How will PBGC use administrative offset (offset of non-tax Federal payments) to collect a debt owed to PBGC?
######## Non-centralized administrative offset for debts owed to PBGC.

(b)(1) When centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, PBGC may collect past-due, legally enforceable debts owed to PBGC through non-centralized administrative offset. See 31 CFR 901.3(c). In these cases, PBGC may offset a payment internally or make an offset request directly to a Federal payment agency.
