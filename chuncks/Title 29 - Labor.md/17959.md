####### Toxic, corrosive, irritant or fumigated atmospheres and residues.

(c)(1) The employer shall ensure that spaces or adjacent spaces that contain or have contained liquids, gases, or solids that are toxic, corrosive or irritant are:

(i) Inspected visually by the competent person to determine the presence of toxic, corrosive, or irritant residue contaminants; and

(ii) Tested by a competent person prior to initial entry by an employee to determine the air concentration of toxics, corrosives, or irritants within the space.

(2) If a space contains an air concentration of a material which exceeds a part 1915 subpart Z permissible exposure limit (PEL) or is IDLH, the space shall be labeled "Not Safe for Workers." Ventilation shall be provided at volumes and flow rates which will ensure that air concentrations are maintained within the PEL or, in the case of contaminants for which there is no established PEL, below the IDLH. The warning label may be removed when the concentration of contaminants is maintained within the PEL or below IDLH level.

(3) If a space cannot be ventilated to within the PELs or is IDLH, a Marine Chemist or CIH must re-test until the space can be certified "Enter with Restrictions" or "Safe for Workers."

(4) An employee may not enter a space whose atmosphere exceeds a PEL or is IDLH. Exception: An employee may enter for emergency rescue, or for a short duration for installation of ventilation equipment provided:

(i) The atmosphere in the space is monitored continuously;

(ii) Respiratory protection and other necessary and appropriate personal protective equipment and clothing are provided in accordance with subpart I of this part.
