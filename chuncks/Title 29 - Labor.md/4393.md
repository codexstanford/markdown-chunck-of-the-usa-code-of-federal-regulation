###### Criteria for Determining Who Must Be Bonded
####### ยง 453.8 Personnel who "handle" funds or other property.
######## Persons included generally.

(b)The basic objective of section 502(a) is to provide reasonable protection of funds or other property rather than to insure against every conceivable possibility of loss. Accordingly, a person shall be deemed to be "handling" funds or other property, so as to require bonding under that section, whenever his duties or activities with respect to given funds or other property are such that there is a significant risk of loss by reason of fraud or dishonesty on the part of such person, acting either alone or in collusion with others.
