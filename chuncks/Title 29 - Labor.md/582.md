## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Labor
### PART 10 - ESTABLISHING A MINIMUM WAGE FOR CONTRACTORS
#### Appendix A to 29 CFR Part 10 - Contract Clause
##### Contract Suspension/Contract Termination/Contractor Debarment.

(d)In the event of a failure to pay any worker all or part of the wages due under Executive Order 13658 or 29 CFR part 10, or a failure to comply with any other term or condition of Executive Order 13658 or 29 CFR part 10, the contracting agency may on its own action or after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment, advance or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the contractor in default with any additional cost. A breach of the contract clause may be grounds for debarment as a contractor and subcontractor as provided in 29 CFR 10.52.

(e) The contractor may not discharge any part of its minimum wage obligation under Executive Order 13658 by furnishing fringe benefits or, with respect to workers whose wages are governed by the Service Contract Act, the cash equivalent thereof.

(f) Nothing herein shall relieve the contractor of any other obligation under Federal, State or local law, or under contract, for the payment of a higher wage to any worker, nor shall a lower prevailing wage under any such Federal, State, or local law, or under contract, entitle a contractor to pay less than $10.10 (or the minimum wage as established each January thereafter) to any worker.
