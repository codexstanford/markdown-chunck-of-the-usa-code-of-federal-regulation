###### ยง 4.177 Discharging fringe benefit obligations by equivalent means.
####### Furnishing equivalent fringe benefits.

(b)(1) A contractor's obligation to furnish fringe benefits which are stated in a specified cash amount may be discharged by furnishing any combination of "bona fide" fringe benefits costing an equal amount. Thus, if an applicable determination specifies that 20 cents per hour is to be paid into a pension fund, this fringe benefit obligation will be deemed to be met if, instead, hospitalization benefits costing not less than 20 cents per hour are provided. The same obligation will be met if hospitalization benefits costing 10 cents an hour and life insurance benefits costing 10 cents an hour are provided. As set forth in ยง 4.171(c), no benefit required to be furnished the employee by any other law, such as workers' compensation, may be credited toward satisfying the fringe benefit requirements of the Act.

(2) A contractor who wishes to furnish equivalent fringe benefits in lieu of those benefits which are not stated in a specified cash amount, such as "one week paid vacation", must first determine the equivalent cash value of such benefits in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
