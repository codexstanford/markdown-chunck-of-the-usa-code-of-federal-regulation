######## ยง 780.1016 Use of evergreens and forest products.
######### Mitchell,Hunt,

Harvesting of evergreens and other forest products is exempt only when these products will be "used in making such wreaths." The phrase "used in making such wreaths" places a definite limitation on the purpose for which evergreens may be harvested under section 13(d). Harvesting of these materials for a use other than making wreaths is nonexempt. Also, such harvesting is nonexempt when the evergreens are used for wreathmaking by persons other than the homeworkers (seev.263 F. 2d 913). For example, harvesting of evergreens for sale or distribution to an employer who uses them in his factory to make wreaths is not exempt.
