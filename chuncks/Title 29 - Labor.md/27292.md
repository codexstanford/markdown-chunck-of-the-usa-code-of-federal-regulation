####### Meaning of Signature.

(b)A document or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form. When a party or representative of the party signs a document in the manner described in paragraph (a) of this section, that person's signature shall constitute his certificate:

(1) That under the provisions of the law, including these rules and all federal conflict of interest statutes, he is authorized and qualified to represent the particular party in the matter; and

(2) That he has read the document; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
