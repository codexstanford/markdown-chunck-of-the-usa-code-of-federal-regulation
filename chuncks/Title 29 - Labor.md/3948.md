(2) If the General Counsel claims that any statement ordered to be produced under this section contains matter which does not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the Administrative Law Judge will order the General Counsel to deliver the statement for the inspection of the Administrative Law JudgeUpon delivery, the Administrative Law Judge will excise the portions of such statement which do not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness except that the Administrative Law Judge has discretion to decline to excise portions which, although not relating to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, do relate to other matters raised by the pleadings. With the material excised, the Administrative Law Judge will then direct delivery of the statement to the Respondent for use on cross-examination. If any portion of the statement is withheld and the Respondent objects to the withholding, the General Counsel will preserve the entire text of the statement, and, if the Respondent files exceptions with the Board based upon such withholding, make the entire text available to the Board for the purpose of determining the correctness of the ruling of the Administrative Law Judge. If the General Counsel elects not to comply with an order of the Administrative Law Judge directing delivery to the Respondent of any statement, or portion thereof as the Administrative Law Judge may direct, the Administrative Law Judge will strike from the record the testimony of the witness.
