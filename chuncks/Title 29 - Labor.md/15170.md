####### General.

(2)For any employee to work transmission and distribution lines or equipment as deenergized, the employer shall ensure that the lines or equipment are deenergized under the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section and shall ensure proper grounding of the lines or equipment as specified in paragraphs (n)(3) through (n)(8) of this section. However, if the employer can demonstrate that installation of a ground is impracticable or that the conditions resulting from the installation of a ground would present greater hazards to employees than working without grounds, the lines and equipment may be treated as deenergized provided that the employer establishes that all of the following conditions apply:

(i) The employer ensures that the lines and equipment are deenergized under the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section.

(ii) There is no possibility of contact with another energized source.

(iii) The hazard of induced voltage is not present.
