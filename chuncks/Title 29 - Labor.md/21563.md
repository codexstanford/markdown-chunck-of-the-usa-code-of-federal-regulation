####### Arc rating.

(5)The employer shall ensure that each employee exposed to hazards from electric arcs wears protective clothing and other protective equipment with an arc rating greater than or equal to the heat energy estimated under paragraph (g)(2) of this section whenever that estimate exceeds 2.0 cal/cm. This protective equipment shall cover the employee's entire body, except as follows:

(i) Arc-rated protection is not necessary for the employee's hands when the employee is wearing rubber insulating gloves with protectors or, if the estimated incident energy is no more than 14 cal/cm, heavy-duty leather work gloves with a weight of at least 407 gm/m(12 oz/yd),

(ii) Arc-rated protection is not necessary for the employee's feet when the employee is wearing heavy-duty work shoes or boots,

(iii) Arc-rated protection is not necessary for the employee's head when the employee is wearing head protection meeting ยง 1926.100(b)(2) if the estimated incident energy is less than 9 cal/cmfor exposures involving single-phase arcs in open air or 5 cal/cmfor other exposures,

(iv) The protection for the employee's head may consist of head protection meeting ยง 1926.100(b)(2) and a faceshield with a minimum arc rating of 8 cal/cmif the estimated incident-energy exposure is less than 13 cal/cmfor exposures involving single-phase arcs in open air or 9 cal/cmfor other exposures, and

(v) For exposures involving single-phase arcs in open air, the arc rating for the employee's head and face protection may be 4 cal/cmless than the estimated incident energy.
