(a)Although provision has not been made for insertion in Government contracts of stipulations requiring compliance with the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, contractors and subcontractors performing contracts subject to the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act may be required to compensate their employees working on or in connection with such contracts for overtime work pursuant to the overtime pay standards of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This is true with respect to employees engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce (including occupations and processes closely related and directly essential to such production) and employees employed in enterprises which are so engaged, subject to the definitions and exceptions provided in such Act. Such employees, except as otherwise specifically provided in such Act, must receive overtime compensation at a rate of not less than 1times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of the applicable standard in a workweek. See part 778 of this title. However, the Fair Labor Standards Act provides no overtime pay requirements for employees, not within such interstate commerce coverage of the Act, who are subject to its minimum wage provisions only by virtue of the provisions of section 6(e), as explained in ยง 4.180.
