Accordingly, notice that items (ii) and (iv) of the Uniform Law Commissioners' Model State Administrative Procedure Act quoted above are not included as separate items in ยง 18.201. However codes and standards, (iv), to the extent not subject to reasonable question fall within ยง 18.201(b)(2). To the extent such codes and standards do not so fall, proof should be required. Official notice of records of other proceedings before the agency would "permit an agency to notice facts contained in its files, such as the revenue statistics contained in the reports submitted to it by a regulated company." Schwartz,at 377. Once again, to the extent such information is not capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, ยง 18.201(b)(2), proof should be required.
