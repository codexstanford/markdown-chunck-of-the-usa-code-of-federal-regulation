######## Conclusion.,Example 6

(B)The same terms requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section is satisfied in this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) () because, under the special rule for new hires in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the full-time employees in each of the three rating areas newly hired on and after January 1, 2022, may be treated as three new hire subclasses and Plan Sponsor E offers the HRA on the same terms to all participants in the new hire subclasses. Further, the minimum class size requirement does not apply to the new hire subclasses.
