####### Amount involved.

(b)Section 502(i) of ERISA states that the term "amount involved" in that section shall be defined as it is defined under section 4975(f)(4) of the Code. As provided in 26 CFR 141.4975.13, 26 CFR 53.4941(e)-1(b) is controlling with respect to the interpretation of the term "amount involved" under section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, the Department of Labor will apply the principles set out at 26 CFR 53.4941(e)-1(b) in determining the "amount involved" in a transaction subject to the civil penalty provided by section 502(i) of the Act and this section.
