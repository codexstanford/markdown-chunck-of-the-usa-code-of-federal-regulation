(1) $15.00 per hour beginning January 30, 2022; and

(2) An amount determined by the Secretary, beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter. The applicable minimum wage determined for each calendar year by the Secretary shall be:

(i) Not less than the amount in effect on the date of such determination;

(ii) Increased from such amount by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (United States city average, all items, not seasonally adjusted), or its successor publication, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and
