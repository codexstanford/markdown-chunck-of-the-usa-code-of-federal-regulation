(c)(1) Breathing gas supply hoses shall:

(i) Have a working pressure at least equal to the working pressure of the total breathing gas system;

(ii) Have a rated bursting pressure at least equal to 4 times the working pressure;

(iii) Be tested at least annually to 1.5 times their working pressure; and

(iv) Have their open ends taped, capped or plugged when not in use.

(2) Breathing gas supply hose connectors shall:

(i) Be made of corrosion-resistant materials;

(ii) Have a working pressure at least equal to the working pressure of the hose to which they are attached; and

(iii) Be resistant to accidental disengagement.

(3) Umbilicals shall:

(i) Be marked in 10-ft. increments to 100 feet beginning at the diver's end, and in 50 ft. increments thereafter;

(ii) Be made of kink-resistant materials; and

(iii) Have a working pressure greater than the pressure equivalent to the maximum depth of the dive (relative to the supply source) plus 100 psi.
