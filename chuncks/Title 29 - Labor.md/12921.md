####### Scope and application.

1.This section has been written to provide adequate coverage of those standpipe and hose systems that an employer may install in the workplace to meet the requirements of a particular OSHA standard. For example, OSHA permits the substitution of hose systems for portable fire extinguishers in ยง 1910.157. If an employer chooses to provide hose systems instead of portable Class A fire extinguishers, then those hose systems used for substitution would have to meet the applicable requirements of ยง 1910.157. All other standpipe and hose systems not used as a substitute would be exempt from these requirements.

The section specifically exempts Class I large hose systems. By large hose systems, OSHA means those 2&#x2033; (6.3 cm) hose lines that are usually associated with fire departments of the size that provide their own water supply through fire apparatus. When the fire gets to the size that outside protection of that degree is necessary, OSHA believes that in most industries employees will have been evacuated from the fire area and the "professional" fire fighters will take control.
