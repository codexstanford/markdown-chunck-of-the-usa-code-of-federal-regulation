(e)A plan sponsor's determinations that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement under ยง 4208.4 and of the amount of reduction determined under ยง 4208.6 shall be subject to plan review under section 4219(b)(2) of ERISA and to arbitration under section 4221 of ERISA and part 4221 of this chapter, within the times prescribed by those provisions.
