(d)Whenever the Commission cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of "unusual circumstances," as defined in the FOIA, and the Commission extends the time limit on that basis, the Commission must, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the agency estimates processing of the request will be completed.
