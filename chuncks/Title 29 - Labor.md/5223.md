Agriculture activities eligible for an extended phase-in of the minimum wage in Major groups 01, 02, and 07 have been incorporated into Appendix B-Nonmanufacturing Industries Eligible for Minimum Wage Phase-In. Applicable wage rates are effective retroactive to April 1, 1990. Employers in the sugarcane farming industry (SIC Number 0133) who are subject to Tier 3 wage rates but who have paid wage rates based on Tier 2 wage rates may not take any action to recoup such payments where those actions would have the effect of reducing the wage rate being paid at the time of such recoupment to below that required under Tier 3.
