######### Wirtz,Lunsford,

As explained in ยง 794.114, the enterprise in addition to being independently owned must also be "independently controlled." The test here is whether the individual, partnership, or corporation which owns the enterprise also controls the enterprise as an independent businessman, free of control by any so-called major oil company or other person engaged in the petroleum business. Control by others may be evidenced by ownership; but control may exist in the absence of any ownership. For example where an enterprise engaged in the wholesale or bulk distribution of petroleum products enters into franchise or other arrangements which have the effect of restricting the products it distributes, the prices it may charge, or otherwise controlling the activities of the enterprise in those respects which are the common attributes of an independent businessman, these facts may establish that the enterprise is not "independently controlled" as required by the exemption under section 7(b)(3). (v.404 F. 2d 693 (C.A. 6).)
