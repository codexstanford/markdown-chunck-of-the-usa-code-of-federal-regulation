######### "Goods" upon which the described activities are performed.

(a)Employees will be considered to be handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods within the meaning of section 3(s) if they engage in the described activities on "goods" which "have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person." They may be handling or working on such goods which the enterprise does not sell. The term "goods" is defined in section 3(i) of the Act. The definition is explained in ยง 779.107 and discussed comprehensively in part 776 of this chapter. As defined in section 3(i) of the Act, the term includes any part or ingredient of "goods" and, in general, includes "articles or subjects of commerce of any character." Thus the term "goods," as used in section 3(s), includes all goods which have been moved in or produced for commerce, such as stock-in-trade, or raw materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce.
