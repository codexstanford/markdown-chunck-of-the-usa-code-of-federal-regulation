####### ยง 825.304 Employee failure to provide notice.
######## Unforeseeable leave.

(d)When the need for FMLA leave is unforeseeable and an employee fails to give notice in accordance with ยง 825.303, the extent to which an employer may delay FMLA coverage for leave depends on the facts of the particular case. For example, if it would have been practicable for an employee to have given the employer notice of the need for leave very soon after the need arises consistent with the employer's policy, but instead the employee provided notice two days after the leave began, then the employer may delay FMLA coverage of the leave by two days.
