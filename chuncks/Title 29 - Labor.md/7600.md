######## Use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave.,See,See,See,See

(b)An eligible employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave after the placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care only if the employer agrees. Thus, for example, the employer and employee may agree to a part-time work schedule after the placement for bonding purposes. If the employer agrees to permit intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the placement for adoption or foster care, the employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular position. Transfer to an alternative position may require compliance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement, federal law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act), and State law. Transfer to an alternative position may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent or reduced leave. The employer's agreement is not required for intermittent leave required by the serious health condition of the adopted or foster child.§§ 825.202-825.205 for general rules governing the use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave.§ 825.120 for general rules governing leave for pregnancy and birth of a child.§ 825.601 for special rules applicable to instructional employees of schools.§ 825.802 for special rules applicable to airline flight crew employees.
