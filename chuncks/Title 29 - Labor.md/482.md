###### New contract

means a contract that results from a solicitation issued on or between January 1, 2015 and January 29, 2022, or a contract that is awarded outside the solicitation process on or between January 1, 2015 and January 29, 2022. This term includes both new contracts and replacements for expiring contracts. It does not apply to the unilateral exercise of a pre-negotiated option to renew an existing contract by the Federal Government. For purposes of the Executive Order, a contract that is entered into prior to January 1, 2015 will constitute a new contract if, through bilateral negotiation, on or between January 1, 2015 and January 29, 2022:

(1) The contract is renewed;

(2) The contract is extended, unless the extension is made pursuant to a term in the contract as of December 31, 2014, providing for a short-term limited extension; or

(3) The contract is amended pursuant to a modification that is outside the scope of the contract.
