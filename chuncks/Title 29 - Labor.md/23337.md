###### ยง 1977.5 Persons protected by section 11(c).
####### NLRB,Lamar Creamery,

(b) For purposes of section 11(c), even an applicant for employment could be considered an employee. See,v.246 F. 2d 8 (5th Cir., 1957). Further, because section 11(c) speaks in terms of any employee, it is also clear that the employee need not be an employee of the discriminator. The principal consideration would be whether the person alleging discrimination was an "employee" at the time of engaging in protected activity.

(c) In view of the definitions of "employer" and "employee" contained in the Act, employees of a State or political subdivision thereof would not ordinarily be within the contemplated coverage of section 11(c).
