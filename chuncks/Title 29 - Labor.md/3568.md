##### ยง 99.525 Criteria for Federal program risk.
###### Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.

(c)(1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could indicate risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity which disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk. However, monitoring which disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.

(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs which are higher risk. The OMB plans to provide this identification in the compliance supplement.
