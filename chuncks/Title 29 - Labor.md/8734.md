(1) There is widespread confusion concerning the extent of accommodation under thedecision.

(2) The religious practices of some individuals and some groups of individuals are not being accommodated.

(3) Some of those practices which are not being accommodated are:

-Observance of a Sabbath or religious holidays;

-Need for prayer break during working hours;

-Practice of following certain dietary requirements;

-Practice of not working during a mourning period for a deceased relative;

-Prohibition against medical examinations;

-Prohibition against membership in labor and other organizations; and

-Practices concerning dress and other personal grooming habits.

(4) Many of the employers who testified had developed alternative employment practices which accommodate the religious practices of employees and prospective employees and which meet the employer's business needs.

(5) Little evidence was submitted by employers which showed actual attempts to accommodate religious practices with resultant unfavorable consequences to the employer's business. Employers appeared to have substantial anticipatory concerns but no, or very little, actual experience with the problems they theorized would emerge by providing reasonable accommodation for religious practices.

Based on these findings, the Commission is revising its Guidelines to clarify the obligation imposed by section 701(j) to accommodate the religious practices of employees and prospective employees.
