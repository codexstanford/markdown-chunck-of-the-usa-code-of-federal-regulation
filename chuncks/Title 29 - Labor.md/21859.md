####### Probability that an electric arc will occur.

Identify employees exposed to electric-arc hazards. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration will consider an employee exposed to electric-arc hazards if there is a reasonable likelihood that an electric arc will occur in the employee's work area, in other words, if the probability of such an event is higher than it is for the normal operation of enclosed equipment. Factors to consider include:

- For energized circuit parts not guarded or insulated, whether conductive objects can come too close to or fall onto the energized parts,

- For exposed, energized circuit parts, whether the employee is closer to the part than the minimum approach distance established by the employer (as permitted by ยง 1926.960(c)(1)(iii)).

- Whether the operation of electric equipment with sliding parts that could fault during operation is part of the normal operation of the equipment or occurs during servicing or maintenance, and

- For energized electric equipment, whether there is evidence of impending failure, such as evidence of arcing or overheating.

Table 1 provides task-based examples of exposure assessments.
