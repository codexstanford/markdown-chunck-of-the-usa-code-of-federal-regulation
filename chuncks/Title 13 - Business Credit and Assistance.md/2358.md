###### Program Preference.

Any arrangement giving the Seller, Pool Originator, or a Program Associate or Affiliate of Seller or Pool Originator, a preference or benefit of proportion greater than its Loan Interest as compared to Pool Originator, Pool Investor, or SBA relating to the making, servicing, or liquidation of the Loan with respect to such things as repayment, collateral, guarantees, control, maintenance of a compensating balance, purchase of a certificate of deposit or acceptance of a separate or companion loan, without SBA's consent. Seller's agreement to grant a Pool Loan's Obligor a deferment in return for receiving more collateral on a different loan owned by Seller is an example of a preference.
