###### ยง 124.509 What are non-8(a) business activity targets?
####### i.e.,

(A) To qualify for reinstatement during the first six months of the current program year (at either the first or second quarterly review), the Participant must demonstrate that it has received non-8(a) revenue and new non-8(a) contract awards that are equal to or greater than the dollar amount by which it failed to meet its non-8(a) business activity target for the just completed program year. For this purpose, SBA will not count options on existing non-8(a) contracts in determining whether a Participant has received new non-8(a) contract awards.
