####### Licensee's obligation to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and Charges.

(b)You are obligated to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and Charges only if you have profit as determined in paragraph (d) of this section.

(1) Prioritized Payments that you must pay (or have already paid) because you have sufficient profit are "Earned Prioritized Payments".

(2) Prioritized Payments that have not become payable because you lack sufficient profit are "Accumulated Prioritized Payments". Treat all Prioritized Payments as "Accumulated" until they become "Earned" under this section.

(3) Adjustments (computed under paragraph (f) of this section) and Charges (computed under ยง 107.1130(d)(2)) are "earned" according to the same criteria applied to Prioritized Payments.
