###### Eligibility to receive Federal surplus personal property.

(b)To be eligible to receive Federal surplus personal property, on the date of transfer a concern must:

(1) Be located in a disaster area;

(2) Qualify as small under the size standard corresponding to its primary NAICS code and certify its size in SAM.gov, or a successor system, prior to seeking access to surplus property. SASPs and GSA may rely on a concern's certification as small for purposes of this program;

(3) Not be debarred, suspended, or declared ineligible under Title 2 or Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations;

(4) Be engaged or expect to be engaged in business activities making the item useful to it; and

(5) Not have received a transfer of property under ยง 124.405 of this chapter during the covered period. The 2-year period of the presidentially declared disaster does not affect eligibility for additional technology transfers or surplus personal property to a small business concern located in a disaster area for a subsequent presidentially declared disaster occurring within the original 2-year period of a prior presidentially declared disaster.
