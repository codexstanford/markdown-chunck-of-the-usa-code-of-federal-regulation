(c)SBA may review the concern's recertification through the program examination process when deemed appropriate and will do so every three years pursuant to ยง 126.500.

(2) If SBA determines that the concern continues to be eligible, SBA will notify the concern of this determination. In such case, the concern will:

(i) Continue to be designated as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS (or successor system); and

(ii) Be treated as an eligible HUBZone small business concern for all HUBZone contracts for which the concern qualifies as small for a period of one year from the date of the recertification.
