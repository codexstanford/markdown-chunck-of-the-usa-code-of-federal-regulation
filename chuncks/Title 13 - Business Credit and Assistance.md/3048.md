## Chapter I - Small Business Administration
### PART 125 - GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PROGRAMS
#### ยง 125.2 What are SBA's and the procuring agency's responsibilities when providing contracting assistance to small businesses?
##### e.g.,

(v) When drafting the solicitation for the contract, agencies should consider an "on ramp" provision that permits the agency to refresh these awards by adding more small business contractors to that portion of the contract that was set-aside throughout the life of the contract. Agencies should also consider the need to "off ramp" existing contractors that no longer qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract (termination for convenience).

(vi) The small business must submit one offer that addresses each part of the solicitation for which it wants to compete. A small business (or 8(a) Participant, HUBZone SBC, SDVO SBC or ED/WOSB) is not required to submit an offer on the part of the solicitation that is not set-aside. However, a small business may choose to submit an offer on the part or parts of the solicitation that have been set-aside and/or on the parts that have not been set-aside.
