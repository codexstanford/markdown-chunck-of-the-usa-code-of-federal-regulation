####### Requirements for Licensee's first issuance of Participating Securities.

(c)When you apply for your first issuance of Participating Securities, you must comply with the following:

(1) For each of your Loans and Investments, you must submit:

(i) The most recent annual report (or fiscal year-end financial statements) and the most recent interim financial statements of the Small Business; and

(ii) Your valuation reports on the Small Business, prepared as of the end of each of your last three fiscal years. If you have applied for Participating Securities on the basis of interim financial statements, you must also submit a valuation report as of your interim financial statement date.

(2) If you have negative Undistributed Net Realized Earnings and/or a net Unrealized Loss on Securities Held, SBA may require you to undergo a quasi-reorganization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

(3) If your financial statements accompanying the Participating Securities application are for an interim period, you must have your SBA-approved independent public accountant perform a limited-scope audit of the statements. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), "limited scope audit" means auditing procedures sufficient to enable the independent public accountant to express an opinion on the Statement of Financial Position and the accompanying Schedule of Loans and Investments.
