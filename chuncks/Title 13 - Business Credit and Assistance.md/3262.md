(2) Been decertified as a result of the procedures set forth in ยง 126.503; or

(3) Voluntarily withdrawn from the HUBZone program pursuant to ยง 126.501(b).

(b) SBA will remove the designation of a concern in DSBS (or successor system) as a certified HUBZone small business concern as soon as the D/HUB issues a decision decertifying the concern from the program.

(c) After a concern has been removed as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS (or successor system), it is ineligible for the HUBZone program and may not submit an offer for a HUBZone contract.

(1) As long as the concern was eligible at the time of its offer (and eligibility relates back to the date of its certification or recertification), it could be awarded a HUBZone contract even if it no longer appears as a certified HUBZone small business concern on DSBS on the date of award.
