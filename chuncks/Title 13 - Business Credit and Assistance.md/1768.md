####### Collateral.

(h)SBA requires each lender to follow the collateral policies and procedures that it has established and implemented for similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. The lender's collateral policies must be commercially reasonable and prudent. Lenders will certify that the collateral policies applied to the ARC Loan meet this standard. Lenders may charge borrowers the direct cost of securing and liquidating collateral for ARC Loans. SBA will reimburse Lenders for the direct cost of liquidating collateral that are not reimbursed by the borrower in the event of default. Reimbursement of the direct costs of liquidation by SBA to the Lender is limited to the amount of the recovery received on the ARC Loan.
