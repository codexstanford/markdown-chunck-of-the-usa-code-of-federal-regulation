##### ยง 126.801 How does an interested party file a HUBZone status protest?
###### Format and specificity.

(b)(1) Protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds for why the protested concern did not meet the HUBZone eligibility requirements set forth in ยง 126.200 at the time the concern applied for certification or at the time SBA last recertified the concern as a HUBZone small business concern. A protest merely asserting that the protested concern did not qualify as a HUBZone small business concern at the time of certification or recertification, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, is insufficient. A protest asserting that a concern was not in compliance with the HUBZone eligibility requirements at the time of offer or award will be dismissed.

(2) For a protest filed against a HUBZone joint venture, the protest must state all specific grounds for why-

(i) The HUBZone small business concern partner to the joint venture did not meet the HUBZone eligibility requirements set forth in ยง 126.200 at the time the concern applied for certification or at the time SBA last recertified the concern as a HUBZone small business concern; and/or

(ii) The protested HUBZone joint venture did not meet the requirements set forth in ยง 126.616 at the time the joint venture submitted an offer for a HUBZone contract.
