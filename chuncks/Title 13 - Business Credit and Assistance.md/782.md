(d)Upon the occurrence (as determined by SBA) of any Removal Condition, or any Contingent Removal Condition accompanied by your failure to act as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, SBA has the following rights, and you consent to SBA's exercise of any or all of such rights:

(1) With respect to a Corporate Licensee, upon written notice, to require you to replace, with individuals approved by SBA, one or more of your officers and/or such number of directors as is sufficient to constitute a majority of your board of directors; or

(2) With respect to a Partnership Licensee, upon written notice, to require you to remove the person(s) responsible for such occurrence and/or to remove your general partner, who shall then be replaced in accordance with your Articles by a new general partner approved by SBA; and/or

(3) With respect to either a Corporate or Partnership Licensee, to the appointment of SBA or its designee as your receiver under section 311(c) of the Act for the purpose of continuing your operations.
