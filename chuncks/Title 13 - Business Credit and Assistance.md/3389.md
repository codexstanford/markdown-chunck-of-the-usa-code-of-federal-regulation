#### Subpart B - Eligibility Requirements To Qualify as an EDWOSB or WOSB
##### ยง 127.203 What are the rules governing the requirement that economically disadvantaged women must own EDWOSBs?
###### General.

(a)To qualify as an EDWOSB, the concern must be at least 51 percent owned by one or more women who are economically disadvantaged. A woman is economically disadvantaged if she can demonstrate that her ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same or similar line of business. SBA does not take into consideration community property laws when determining economic disadvantage when the woman has no direct, individual or separate ownership interest in the property.
