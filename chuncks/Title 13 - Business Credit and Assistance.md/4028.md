## Chapter I - Small Business Administration
### PART 134 - RULES OF PROCEDURE GOVERNING CASES BEFORE THE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS
#### Subpart F - Implementation of the Equal Access to Justice Act
##### ยง 134.601 What is the purpose of this subpart?

The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, establishes procedures by which prevailing parties in certain administrative proceedings may apply for reimbursement of fees and other expenses. Eligible parties may receive awards when they prevail over SBA, unless SBA's position in the proceeding was "substantially justified" or, as provided in ยง 134.605(b), special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules of this subpart explain which OHA proceedings are covered, who may be eligible for an award of fees and expenses, and how to apply for such an award.
