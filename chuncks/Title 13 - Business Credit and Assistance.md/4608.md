## Chapter III - Economic Development Administration, Department of Commerce
### PART 307 - ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE INVESTMENTS
#### Subpart B - Revolving Loan Fund Program
##### ยง 307.17 Requirements for Revolving Loan Fund Cash Available for Lending.
###### e.g.,

(i) The RLF Recipient sufficiently demonstrates in the loan documentation a "sound economic justification" for the refinancing (the refinancing will support additional capital investment intended to increase business activities). For this purpose, reducing the risk of loss to an existing lender(s) or lowering the cost of financing to a borrower shall not, without other indicia, constitute a sound economic justification; or

(ii) RLF Cash Available for Lending will finance the purchase of the rights of a prior lien holder during a foreclosure action which is necessary to preclude a significant loss on an RLF loan. RLF funds may be used for this purpose only if there is a high probability of receiving compensation from the sale of assets sufficient to cover an RLF's costs plus a reasonable portion of the outstanding RLF loan within a reasonable time frame approved by EDA following the date of refinancing.

(7) Serve as collateral to obtain credit or any other type of financing without EDA's prior written approval;

(8) Support operations or administration of the RLF Recipient; or

(9) Undertake any activity that would violate the requirements found in part 314 of this chapter, including ยง 314.3 ("Authorized Use of Property") and ยง 314.4 ("Unauthorized Use of Property").
