####### Licensees that have issued Participating Securities on more than one occasion.

(2)Determine the Treasury Rate for each of the dates you issued Participating Securities.

(i) Compute an average of all such Treasury Rates, weighted to reflect the dollar amount of each issuance (ignoring any redemptions) and the number of days from the date of each issuance to the date as of which you are computing the Profit Participation Rate.

(ii) Adjust the Profit Participation Rate from paragraph (f) of this section by the percentage difference between the weighted average Treasury Rate and 8 percent. In the example given in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, if the PLC ratio were equal to 2, the Profit Participation Rate for the fiscal year would be 12.83 percent. [{((.0855-.08) &#xF7; .08) + 1} x .12 x 100 = 12.83%]
