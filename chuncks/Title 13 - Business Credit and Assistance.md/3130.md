#### ยง 125.9 What are the rules governing SBA's small business mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; program?
##### General.

(a)The small business mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; program is designed to enhance the capabilities of prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms by requiring approved mentors to provide business development assistance to prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms and to improve the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms' ability to successfully compete for federal contracts. This assistance may include technical and/or management assistance; financial assistance in the form of equity investments and/or loans; subcontracts (either from the mentor to the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; or from the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; to the mentor); trade education; and/or assistance in performing prime contracts with the Government through joint venture arrangements. Mentors are encouraged to provide assistance relating to the performance of contracts set aside or reserved for small business so that prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms may more fully develop their capabilities.
