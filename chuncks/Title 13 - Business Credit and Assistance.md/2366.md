###### Weighted Average Interest Rate.

The dollar-weighted average interest rate of a Pool Certificate calculated by multiplying the interest rate of each Loan Interest in the Pool by the ratio of that Loan Interest's current outstanding principal in the SBA-guaranteed portion of the Pool (that is, the portion of the Pool Loan backing the Pool Certificates) to the current aggregate or outstanding principal of each Loan Interest in the SBA-guaranteed portion of the Pool, and adding the sum of the resulting products. The Pool Certificate interest rate will fluctuate over the life of the Pool as defaults, prepayments and normal repayments applicable to Loan Interests in the Pool occur.
