###### Lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation

include all lands within the perimeter of an Indian reservation, whether tribally owned and governed or not. For example, land that is individually owned and located within the perimeter of an Indian reservation is "lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation." By contrast, an Indian-owned parcel of land that is located outside the perimeter of an Indian reservation is not "lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation."
