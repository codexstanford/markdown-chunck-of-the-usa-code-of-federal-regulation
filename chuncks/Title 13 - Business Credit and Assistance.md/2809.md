SBA will consider a spouse's financial situation in determining an individual's access to credit and capital where the spouse has a role in the business (an officer, employee or director) or has lent money to, provided credit support to, or guaranteed a loan of the business. SBA does not take into consideration community property laws when determining economic disadvantage.
