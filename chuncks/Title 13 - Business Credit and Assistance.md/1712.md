Under the EWCP, SBA guarantees short-term working capital loans made by participating lenders to exporters (section 7(a)(14) of the Act). Loan maturities may be for up to three years with annual renewals. Proceeds can be used only to finance export transactions. Loans can be for single or multiple export transactions. An export transaction is the production and payment associated with a sale of goods or services to a foreign buyer. The maximum loan amount for any one EWCP loan is $5,000,000. EWCP loans shall receive a guaranty of 90 percent, not to exceed $4,500,000.
