###### ยง 124.503 How does SBA accept a procurement for award through the 8(a) BD program?
####### Repetitive acquisitions.

(g)A procuring activity contracting officer must submit a new offering letter to SBA where he or she intends to award a follow-on or repetitive contract as an 8(a) award.

(1) This enables SBA to determine:

(i) Whether the requirement should be a competitive 8(a) award;

(ii) A nominated firm's eligibility, whether or not it is the same firm that performed the previous contract;

(iii) The affect that contract award would have on the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts; and

(iv) Whether the requirement should continue under the 8(a) BD program.
