(1)(i) In the case of a Bid Bond, the Person requesting bids for the performance of a Contract; or

(ii) In the case of a Final Bond, the Person who has contracted with a Principal for the completion of the Contract and to whom the primary obligation of the Surety runs in the event of a breach by the Principal.

(2) In either case, no Person (other than a Federal department or agency) may be named co-Obligee or Obligee on a bond or on a rider to the bond unless that Person is bound by the Contract to the Principal (or to the Surety, if the Surety has arranged completion of the Contract) to the same extent as the original Obligee. In no event may the addition of one or more co-Obligees increase the aggregate liability of the Surety under the bond.
