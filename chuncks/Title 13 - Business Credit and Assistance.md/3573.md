###### see,see,see

(ii) Recertification does not change the terms and conditions of the contract. The limitations on subcontracting (ยง 125.6 of this chapter), nonmanufacturer (ยง 121.406(b) of this chapter), and subcontracting plan requirements (ยง 125.3(a) of this chapter) in effect at the time of contract award remain in effect throughout the life of the contract. However, a concern that initially self-certified as an SDVOSB for the award of an SDVOSB contract may recertify as an SDVOSB only if it is currently a certified SDVOSB.

(iii) Where the contracting officer explicitly requires concerns to recertify their status in response to a solicitation for an order, SBA will determine eligibility as of the date the concern submits its response to the solicitation for the order.

(iv) A concern's status may be determined at the time of a response to a solicitation for an Agreement and each order issued pursuant to the Agreement.
