Sureties interested in participating as Prior Approval Sureties or PSB Sureties should apply in writing to the D/SG at 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416. OSG will determine the eligibility of the applicant considering its standards and procedures for underwriting, administration, claims and recovery. Each applicant must be a corporation listed by the U.S. Treasury as eligible to issue bonds in connection with Federal procurement contracts. At a minimum, each applicant must have salaried staff that is employed directly (not an agent or other individual or entity under contract with the applicant) to oversee its underwriting function and perform all claims and recovery functions other than specialized services the costs of which may be reimbursable under 13 CFR 115.16(e)(1). Final settlement authority for claims and recovery must be vested only in the applicant's salaried claims staff. The applicant must continue to comply with SBA's standards and procedures for underwriting, administration, claims, recovery, and staffing requirements while participating in SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Programs.
