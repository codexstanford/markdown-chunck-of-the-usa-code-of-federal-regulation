####### Executive Committee.

(i)To the extent authorized in the Bylaws, the Board of Directors may establish an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee may exercise the authority of the Board; however, the delegation of its authority does not relieve the Board of its responsibility imposed by law or Loan Program Requirements. No further delegation or redelegation of this authority is permitted. If the Board establishes an Executive Committee and delegates any of its authority to the Executive Committee as set forth in the Bylaws of the CDC, the Executive Committee must:

(A) Be chosen by and from the Board of Directors from the Board; and

(B) Meet the same organizational and representational requirements as the Board of Directors, except that the Executive Committee must have a minimum of four voting members who must be present to conduct business.
