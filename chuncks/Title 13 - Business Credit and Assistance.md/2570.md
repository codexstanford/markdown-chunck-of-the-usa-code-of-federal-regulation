####### ยง 121.603 How does SBA determine whether a Participant is small for a particular 8(a) BD subcontract?
######## Changes in size between date of self-certification and date of award.

(c)(1) Where SBA verifies that the selected Participant is small for a particular procurement, subsequent changes in size up to the date of award, except those due to merger with or acquisition by another business concern, will not affect the firm's size status for that procurement.

(2) Where a Participant has merged with or been acquired by another business concern between the date of its self-certification and the date of award, the concern must recertify its size status, and SBA must verify the new certification before award can occur.
