##### ยง 123.104 What interest rate will I pay on my home disaster loan?

If you can obtain credit elsewhere, your interest rate is set by a statutory formula, but will not exceed 8 percent per annum. If you cannot obtain credit elsewhere, your interest rate is one-half the statutory rate, but will not exceed 4 percent per annum. Credit elsewhere means that, with your cash flow and disposable assets, SBA believes you could obtain financing from non-federal sources on reasonable terms. If you cannot obtain credit elsewhere, you also may be able to borrow from SBA to refinance existing recorded liens against your damaged real property. Under prior legislation, some SBA disaster loans had split interest rates. On any such loan, repayments of principal are applied first to that portion of the loan with the lowest interest rate.
