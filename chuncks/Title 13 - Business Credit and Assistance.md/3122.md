### PART 125 - GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PROGRAMS
#### ยง 125.8 What requirements must a joint venture satisfy to submit an offer for a procurement or sale set aside or reserved for small business?
##### Performance of work.,e.g.,

(c)(1) For any contract set aside or reserved for small business that is to be performed by a joint venture between a small business prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; and its SBA-approved mentor authorized by ยง 125.9, the joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by ยง 125.6, and the small business partner to the joint venture must perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture. Except as set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the 40% calculation for prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; workshare follows the same rules as those set forth in ยง 125.6 concerning supplies, construction, and mixed contracts, including the exclusion of the same costs from the limitation on subcontracting calculation (cost of materials excluded from the calculation in construction contracts).

(2) The work performed by the small business partner to a joint venture must be more than administrative or ministerial functions so that it gains substantive experience.

(3) The amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the small business prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; partner must be at least 40% of the total done by the partners. In determining the amount of work done by a mentor participating in a joint venture with a small business prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, all work done by the mentor and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will be counted.

(4) Work performed by a similarly situated entity will not count toward the requirement that a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; must perform at least 40% of the work performed by a joint venture.
