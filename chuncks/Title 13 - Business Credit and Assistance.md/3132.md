### PART 125 - GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PROGRAMS
#### ยง 125.9 What are the rules governing SBA's small business mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; program?
##### e.g.,

(3) In order for SBA to agree to allow a mentor to have more than one prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; at time, the mentor and proposed additional prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; must demonstrate that the added mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; relationship will not adversely affect the development of either prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm (the second firm may not be a competitor of the first firm).

(i) A mentor that has more than one prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; cannot submit competing offers in response to a solicitation for a specific procurement through separate joint ventures with different prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s.

(ii) A mentor generally cannot have more than three prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s at one time. However, the first two mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; relationships approved by SBA between a specific mentor and a covered territory business, or a specific mentor and a small business that has its principal office located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, do not count against the limit of three proteges that a mentor can have at one time.
