#### ยง 125.9 What are the rules governing SBA's small business mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; program?
##### Mentors.

(b)Any concern that demonstrates a commitment and the ability to assist small business concerns may act as a mentor and receive benefits as set forth in this section. This includes other than small businesses.

(1) In order to qualify as a mentor, a concern must demonstrate that it:

(i) Is capable of carrying out its responsibilities to assist the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm under the proposed mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement;

(ii) Does not appear on the Federal list of debarred or suspended contractors; and

(iii) Can impart value to a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm due to lessons learned and practical experience gained or through its knowledge of general business operations and government contracting.

(2) SBA will decline an application if SBA determines that the mentor does not possess good character or a favorable financial position, employs or otherwise controls the managers of the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, or is otherwise affiliated with the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;. Once approved, SBA may terminate the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement if the mentor does not possess good character or a favorable financial position, was affiliated with the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; at time of application, or is affiliated with the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; for reasons other than the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement or assistance provided under the agreement.
