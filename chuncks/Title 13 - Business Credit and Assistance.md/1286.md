## Chapter I - Small Business Administration
### PART 113 - NONDISCRIMINATION IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OF SBA - EFFECTUATION OF POLICIES OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SBA ADMINISTRATOR
#### Subpart A - General Provisions
##### ยง 113.5 Compliance information.
###### Information to the Public.

(d)Each recipient shall make available to persons entitled under this part to protection against discrimination by the recipient such information as SBA may find necessary to apprise them of their rights to such protection.

(1) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of equal opportunity. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under ยง 113.5(b) to provide information as to the availability of equal opportunity, and the rights of individuals under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make equal opportunity fully available to racial, qualified handicapped, nationality groups and persons who because of their sex were previously subjected to discrimination.

(2) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates may not in fact be equally available to some racial, qualified handicapped, or nationality groups. In such circumstances a recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, religion, sex, marital status, qualified handicap or national origin to make the opportunities more widely available to such groups.
