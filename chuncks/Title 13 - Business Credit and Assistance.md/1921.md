####### Decision by SBA to take over litigation.

(d)If a Lender or Authorized CDC Liquidator is conducting, or proposes to conduct, debt collection litigation on a 7(a) loan or 504 loan, SBA may take over the litigation if SBA determines that the outcome of the litigation could adversely affect SBA's administration of the loan program or that the Government is entitled to legal remedies that are not available to the Lender or Authorized CDC Liquidator. Examples of cases that could adversely affect SBA's administration of a loan program include, but are not limited to, situations where SBA determines that:

(1) The litigation involves important governmental policy or program issues.

(2) The case is potentially of great precedential value or there is a risk of adverse precedent to the Government.

(3) The Lender or Authorized CDC Liquidator has an actual or potential conflict of interest with SBA.

(4) The legal fees of the Lender or Authorized CDC Liquidator's outside counsel are unnecessary, unreasonable or not customary in the locality.
