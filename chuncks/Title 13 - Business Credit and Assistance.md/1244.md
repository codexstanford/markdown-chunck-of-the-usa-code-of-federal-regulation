## Chapter I - Small Business Administration
### PART 112 - NONDISCRIMINATION IN FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS OF SBA - EFFECTUATION OF TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964
#### ยง 112.7 Illustrative applications.
##### Affirmative action.

(d)(1) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of equal opportunity. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under ยง 112.3(b)(3) to provide information as to the availability of equal opportunity, and the rights of individuals under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make equal opportunity fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination.

(2) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances a recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make opportunity more widely available to such groups.
