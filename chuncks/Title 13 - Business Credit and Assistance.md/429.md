###### ยง 107.590 Licensee's requirement to maintain active operations.
####### Permitted exceptions to activity requirements.

(b)You are considered active if your failure to meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section is the result of one or more of the following factors:

(1) Your excess idle funds are the result of the receipt, within the previous nine months, of realized gains, repayments, additional capital contributions, or Leverage.

(2) It is necessary for you to maintain excess idle funds to conduct your operations because:

(i) Your unfunded commitments from investors are no more than 20 percent of your Regulatory Capital; and

(ii) You cannot receive additional Leverage, solely because SBA has insufficient funds available.

(3) You have not made sufficient Financings because of a lack of available funds, evidenced by Loans and Investments (at cost) equal to at least 90 percent of your Combined Capital as of your most recent fiscal year end.

(4) You have not made sufficient Financings solely because SBA has restricted your ability to make investments.
