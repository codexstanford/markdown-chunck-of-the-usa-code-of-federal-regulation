To be eligible for Leverage, you must:

(a) Demonstrate a need for Leverage, evidenced by your investment activity and a lack of sufficient funds for investment. For your first issuance of Leverage, if you have invested at least 50 percent of your Leverageable Capital, you are presumed to lack sufficient funds for investment.

(b) Have adequate Private Capital to satisfy the requirements for financial viability under § 107.200.

(c) Meet the minimum capital requirements of § 107.210, subject to the following additional conditions:

(1) If you were licensed after September 30, 1996 under the exception in § 107.210(a)(1), you will not be eligible for Leverage until you have Regulatory Capital of at least $5,000,000.

(2) If you were licensed on or before September 30, 1996, and have Regulatory Capital of less than $5,000,000 (less than $10,000,000 if you wish to issue Participating Securities):

(i) You must certify in writing that at least 50 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of your Financings extended after September 30, 1996 will be provided to Smaller Enterprises (as defined in § 107.710(a)); and

(ii) You must demonstrate to SBA's satisfaction that the approval of Leverage will not create or contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the United States government, based on such measurements of profitability and financial viability as SBA deems appropriate.
