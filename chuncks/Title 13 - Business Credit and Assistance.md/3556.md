###### Response to proposed decertification.

(b)The Participant must submit a written response to the notice of proposed decertification within the timeframe specified in the notice. In this response, the Participant must rebut each of the reasons set forth by SBA in the notice of proposed decertification, and where appropriate, the rebuttal must include documents showing that the concern is eligible as of the date specified in the notice. If a Participant fails to cooperate with SBA or fails to provide the information requested, SBA may draw an adverse inference and assume that the information that the concern failed to provide would demonstrate ineligibility.
