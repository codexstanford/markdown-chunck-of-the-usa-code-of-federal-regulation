## Chapter I - Small Business Administration
### PART 125 - GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PROGRAMS
#### ยง 125.2 What are SBA's and the procuring agency's responsibilities when providing contracting assistance to small businesses?
##### e.g.,

(i) Notwithstanding the fair opportunity requirements set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2304c and 41 U.S.C. 4106(c), a contracting officer may set aside orders for small businesses, eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs against full and open Multiple Award Contracts. In addition, a contracting officer may set aside orders for eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs against total small business set-aside Multiple Award Contracts, partial small business set-aside Multiple Award Contracts, and small business reserves of Multiple Award Contracts awarded in full and open competition. Although a contracting officer can set aside orders issued under a small business set-aside Multiple Award Contract or reserve to any subcategory of small businesses, contracting officers are encouraged to review the award dollars under the Multiple Award Contract and aim to make available for award at least 50% of the award dollars under the Multiple Award Contract to all contract holders of the underlying small business set-aside Multiple Award Contract or reserve. However, a contracting officer may not further set aside orders for specific types of small business concerns against Multiple Award Contracts that are set-aside or reserved for eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs (a contracting officer cannot set-aside an order for 8(a) Participants that are also certified HUBZone small business concerns against an 8(a) Multiple Award Contract).

(ii) The contracting officer may state in the solicitation and resulting contract for the Multiple Award Contract that:

(A) Based on the results of market research, orders issued against the Multiple Award Contract will be set-aside for small businesses or any subcategory of small businesses whenever the "rule of two" or any alternative set-aside requirements provided in the small business program have been met; or

(B) The agency is preserving the right to consider set-asides using the "rule of two" or any alternative set-aside requirements provided in the small business program, on an order-by-order basis.

(iii) For the acquisition of orders valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), the contracting officer may set-aside the order for small businesses, 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs in accordance with the relevant program's regulations. For the acquisition of orders valued above the SAT, the contracting officer shall first consider whether there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs in accordance with the program's regulations, before setting aside the requirement as a small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs.
