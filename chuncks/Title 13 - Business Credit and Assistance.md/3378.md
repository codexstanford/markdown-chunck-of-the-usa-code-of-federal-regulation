#### Subpart B - Eligibility Requirements To Qualify as an EDWOSB or WOSB
##### ยง 127.201 What are the requirements for ownership of an EDWOSB and WOSB?
###### Requirement for direct ownership.

(c)To be considered direct, the qualifying women must own 51 percent of the concern directly. The 51 percent ownership may not be through another business entity or a trust (including employee stock ownership plan) that is, in turn, owned and controlled by one or more women or economically disadvantaged women. However, ownership by a trust, such as a living trust, may be treated as the functional equivalent of ownership by a woman or economically disadvantaged woman where the trust is revocable, and the woman is the grantor, the trustee, and the sole current beneficiary of the trust.
