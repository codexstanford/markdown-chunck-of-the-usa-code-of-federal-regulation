###### Limitations on subcontracting.

(d)(1) For any VOSB or SDVOSB contract, including those between a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; and a mentor authorized by ยง 125.9 of this chapter, the joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by ยง 125.6 of this chapter.

(2) The certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner(s) to the joint venture must perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture, except that in the context of a joint venture between a prote&#xB4;g&#xB4; VOSB or SDVOSB and its SBA-approved mentor the VOSB or SDVOSB prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; must individually perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture.

(i) The work performed by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner(s) to a joint venture must be more than administrative or ministerial functions so that they gain substantive experience.

(ii) The amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partners must be at least 40% of the total done by all partners. In determining the amount of work done by a non-VOSB or SDVOSB partner, all work done by the non-VOSB or SDVOSB partner and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will be counted.
