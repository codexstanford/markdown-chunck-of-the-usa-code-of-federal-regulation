##### ยง 123.203 What interest rate will my business pay on a physical disaster business loan and what are the repayment terms?

(a) SBA will announce interest rates with each disaster declaration. If your business, together with its affiliates and principal owners, has credit elsewhere, your interest rate is set by a statutory formula, but will not exceed 8 percent per annum. If you do not have credit elsewhere, your interest rate will not exceed 4 percent per annum. The maturity of your loan depends upon your repayment ability, but cannot exceed seven years if you have credit elsewhere.

(b) Generally, you must pay equal monthly installments, of principal and interest, beginning five months from the date of the loan as shown on the Note. SBA will consider other payment terms if you have seasonal or fluctuating income, and SBA may allow installment payments of varying amounts over the first two years of the loan. There is no penalty for prepayment for disaster loans.

(c) For certain disaster business physical and economic injury loans, an additional payment, based on a percentage of net earnings, will be required to reduce the balance of the loan. This additional payment will not be required until 5 years after repayment begins.
