####### How to evaluate compliance with the Cost of Money ceiling.

(h)You must determine whether a Financing is within the Cost of Money ceiling based on its discounted cash flows, as follows:

(1) Beginning with the date of the first disbursement ("period zero"), identify your cash inflows and cash outflows for each period of the Financing. The appropriate period to use (such as years, quarters, or months) depends on how you have structured the disbursements and payments.

(2) Discount the cash flows back to the first disbursement date using the Cost of Money ceiling from paragraph (d) of this section as the discount rate.

(3) If the result is zero or less, the Financing is within the Cost of Money ceiling; if it is greater than zero, the Financing exceeds the Cost of Money ceiling.
