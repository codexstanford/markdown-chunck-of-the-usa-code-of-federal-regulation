###### ยง 120.1400 Grounds for enforcement actions - SBA Lenders.
####### Additional agreements by CDCs.

(1)By obtaining approval for 504 loans after January 1, 2018, a CDC consents to the remedies in ยง 120.1500(e)(3) and waives in advance any right it may have to contest the validity of the appointment of a receiver. The CDC agrees that its consent to SBA's application to a Federal court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a receiver of SBA's choosing, an injunction or other equitable relief, and the CDC's consent in advance to the court's granting of SBA's application, may be enforced upon any basis in law or equity recognized by the court. The CDC's consent does not preclude the CDC from contesting whether or not SBA has established the grounds for seeking the remedy of a receivership. A CDC's consent to receivership as a remedy does not require SBA to seek appointment of a receiver in any particular SBA enforcement action.
