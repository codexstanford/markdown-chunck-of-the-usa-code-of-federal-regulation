#### ยง 125.2 What are SBA's and the procuring agency's responsibilities when providing contracting assistance to small businesses?
##### PCR recommendations.,e.g.,

(ii)The PCR must recommend to the procuring activity alternative procurement methods that would increase small business prime contract participation if a PCR believes that a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business and is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely; will render small business prime contract participation unlikely (ensure geographical preferences are justified); or is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects. If a PCR does not believe a bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary or justified the PCR shall advocate against the consolidation or bundling of such requirement and recommend to the procuring activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contract participation. Such alternatives may include:

(A) Breaking up the procurement into smaller discrete procurements, especially construction acquisitions that can be procured as separate projects;

(B) Breaking out one or more discrete components, for which a small business set-aside may be appropriate;

(C) Reserving one or more awards for small businesses when issuing Multiple Award Contracts;

(D) Using a partial set-aside;

(E) Stating in the solicitation for a Multiple Award Contract that the orders will be set-aside for small businesses; and

(F) Where the bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary and justified, the PCR will work with the procuring activity to tailor a strategy that preserves small business contract participation to the maximum extent practicable.
