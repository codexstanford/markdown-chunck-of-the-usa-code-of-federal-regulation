#### ยง 125.9 What are the rules governing SBA's small business mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; program?
##### Consequences of not providing assistance set forth in the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement.

(h)(1) Where SBA determines that a mentor may not have provided to the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided may not have been satisfactory, SBA will notify the mentor of such determination and afford the mentor an opportunity to respond. The mentor must respond within 30 days of the notification, presenting information demonstrating that it did satisfactorily provide the assistance set forth in the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement or explaining why it has not provided the agreed upon assistance and setting forth a definitive plan as to when it will provide such assistance. If the mentor fails to respond, does not adequately provide information demonstrating that it did satisfactorily provide the assistance set forth in the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement, does not supply adequate reasons for its failure to provide the agreed upon assistance, or does not set forth a definite plan to provide the assistance:

(i) SBA will terminate the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement;

(ii) The firm will be ineligible to again act as a mentor for a period of two years from the date SBA terminates the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement; and

(iii) SBA may recommend to the relevant procuring agency to issue a stop work order for each federal contract for which the mentor and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; are performing as a small business joint venture in order to encourage the mentor to comply with its mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement. Where a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm is able to independently complete performance of any such contract, SBA may recommend to the procuring agency to authorize a substitution of the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm for the joint venture.

(2) SBA may consider a mentor's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of an SBA-approved mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement as a basis for debarment on the grounds, including but not limited to, that the mentor has not complied with the terms of a public agreement under 2 CFR 180.800(b).
