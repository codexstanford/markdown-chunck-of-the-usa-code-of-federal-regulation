###### ยง 107.1510 How a Licensee computes Earmarked Profit (Loss).
####### How to determine your Earmarked Assets.

(b)"Earmarked Assets" means all the Loans and Investments that you have when you issue Participating Securities or that you acquire while you have Participating Securities outstanding, and any non-cash assets that you receive in exchange for such Loans and Investments.

(1) An Earmarked Asset remains earmarked until you dispose of it, even if you no longer have any outstanding Participating Securities.

(2) Investments you make after redeeming all your Participating Securities are not Earmarked Assets. However, if you issue new Participating Securities, all of your Loans and Investments again become Earmarked Assets.

(3) If you were licensed before March 31, 1993, you may be permitted to exclude Loans and Investments held at that date from Earmarked Assets under ยง 107.1590.
