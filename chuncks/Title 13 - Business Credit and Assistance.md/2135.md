is a commercial loan:

(A) That was incurred not less than 6 months before the date of the application for refinancing available under this paragraph (g).

(B) Substantially all (85% or more) of which was for an Eligible Fixed Asset. If the Eligible Fixed Asset was originally financed through a commercial loan that would have satisfied the "substantially all" standard (the "original loan") and that was subsequently refinanced one or more times, with the current commercial loan being the most recent refinancing, the current commercial loan will be deemed to satisfy this paragraph (B). If the original loan was for the construction of a new building, or the acquisition, renovation, or reconstruction of an existing building, and such loan would not have satisfied the leasing policies set forth in 120.131 and 120.870(b), the current commercial loan will be deemed to satisfy these policies, provided that Borrower demonstrates compliance with 120.131(b) for existing buildings as of the date of application.

(C) That was for the benefit of the small business concern;

(D) That is collateralized by Eligible Fixed Assets; and

(E) That is not a Third Party Loan that is part of an existing 504 Project, except as allowed under paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
