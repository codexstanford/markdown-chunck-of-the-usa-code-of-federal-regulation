## Chapter I - Small Business Administration
### PART 126 - HUBZONE PROGRAM
#### Subpart B - Requirements To Be a Certified HUBZone Small Business Concern
##### ยง 126.204 May a HUBZone small business concern have affiliates?
###### Example to paragraph (c):

(i)X owns 100% of Company A and 51% of Company B. Based on X's common ownership of A and B, the two companies are affiliated under SBA's size regulations. SBA will look at the totality of circumstances to determine whether it would be reasonable to treat the employees of B as employees of A for HUBZone program purposes. If both companies do construction work and share office space and equipment, then SBA would find that there is not a clear line of fracture between the two concerns and would treat the employees of B as employees of A for HUBZone program purposes. In order to be eligible for the HUBZone program, at least 35% of the combined employees of A and B must reside in a HUBZone.

(ii) [Reserved]
