(1)The AA/CA may issue a capital directive upon a determination that the grounds in ยง 120.1400(e)(1) exist. A directive may order the SBLC to:

(i) Achieve its minimum capital requirement applicable to it by a specified date;

(iii) Submit and adhere to a capital restoration plan acceptable to SBA describing the means and time schedule by which the SBLC will achieve the applicable capital requirement (The SBLC must provide its capital restoration plan within 30 days from the date of the SBA order unless SBA notifies the SBLC that the plan is to be filed within a different time period. SBA may perform an on-site examination (generally within 90 days after the restoration plan is submitted) to verify the implementation of the plan and verify that the SBLC meets minimum capital requirements.);
