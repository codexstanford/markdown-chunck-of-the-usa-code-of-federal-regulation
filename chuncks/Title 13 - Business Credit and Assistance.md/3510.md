### PART 128 - VETERAN SMALL BUSINESS CERTIFICATION PROGRAM
#### Subpart B - Eligibility Requirements for the Veteran Small Business Certification Program
##### ยง 128.200 What are the requirements a concern must meet to qualify as a VOSB or SDVOSB?
###### VOSB and SDVOSB certification requirement.

(c)(1) A concern must be certified as a VOSB or SDVOSB pursuant to ยง 128.300 in order to be awarded a VOSB or SDVOSB set-aside or sole source contract. Any small business concern that submits a complete certification application to SBA on or before December 31, 2023, shall be eligible to self-certify for SDVOSB sole source or set-aside contracts (other than VA contracts) until SBA declines or approves the concern's application. Any small business concern that does not submit a complete SDVOSB certification application to SBA on or before December 31, 2023, will no longer be eligible to self-certify for SDVOSB sole source or set-aside contracts effective January 1, 2024.

(2) Other small business concerns that meet the eligibility requirements of this part but do not seek SDVOSB set-aside or sole source contracts may continue to self-certify their SDVOSB status, receive prime contract or subcontract awards that are not SDVOSB set-aside or sole source contracts, and count toward an agency's goal for SDVOSB awards.
