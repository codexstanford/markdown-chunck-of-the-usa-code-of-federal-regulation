###### ยง 107.1530 How a Licensee computes SBA's Profit Participation.
####### Computing SBA's Profit Participation.

(h)If the Base from paragraph (c) of this section is greater than zero, you must compute SBA's Profit Participation as follows:

(1) Multiply the Base from paragraph (c) of this section by the Profit Participation Rate from paragraph (g) of this section.

(2) If your last Profit Participation computation was for an interim period during the same fiscal year and used a higher Profit Participation Rate than the Rate you just used in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, you must adjust the amount computed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section as follows:

(i) Determine the difference between the Profit Participation Rate you just used in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and the Rate used in your previous computation;

(ii) Multiply the difference by the Base from your last Profit Participation computation; and

(iii) Add the result to the amount you computed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

(3) Reduce the Profit Participation computed in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section by any amounts of Profit Participation that you distributed or reserved for distribution to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, for any previous interim period(s) during the fiscal year. The result is SBA's Profit Participation (unless it is less than zero, in which case SBA's Profit Participation is zero).
