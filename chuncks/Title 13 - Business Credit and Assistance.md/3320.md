##### ยง 126.801 How does an interested party file a HUBZone status protest?
###### Timeliness.

(d)(1) For negotiated acquisitions, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror. Except for an order or Blanket Purchase Agreement issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contact, in connection with an order or an Agreement that is set-aside for a certified HUBZone small business concern under a Multiple Award Contract that is not itself set aside for certified HUBZone small business concerns or have a reserve for certified HUBZone small business concerns, (or any HUBZone set-aside order where the contracting officer has requested recertification of such status), an interested party must submit its protest challenging the HUBZone status of a concern for the order or Agreement by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee of the order or Agreement.

(2) For sealed bid acquisitions:

(i) An interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening, or

(ii) If the price evaluation preference was not applied at the time of bid opening, by close of business on the fifth business day from the date of identification of the apparent successful offeror.

(3) Any protest submitted after the time limits is untimely, unless it is from SBA or the CO.

(4) Any protest received prior to bid opening or notification of intended award, whichever applies, is premature.
