If SBA discovers that an ILP Intermediary has made a loan under this program to an ineligible business or for an ineligible purpose, SBA will require the ILP Intermediary to refinance the ineligible loan with non-ILP program funds and to deposit into its ILP Relending Fund an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance on the ineligible loan.
