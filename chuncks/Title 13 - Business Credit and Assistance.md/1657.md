###### ยง 120.180 Compliance with Loan Program Requirements.

SBA Lenders and Intermediaries must comply and maintain familiarity with Loan Program Requirements for the 7(a) Loan Program, 504 Loan Program, and the Microloan Program, as applicable, and as such requirements are revised from time to time. Loan Program Requirements in effect at the time that an SBA Lender or Intermediary takes an action in connection with a particular loan govern that specific action. For example, although loan closing requirements in effect when an SBA Lender closes a loan will govern the closing actions, an SBA Lender's liquidation actions on the same loan are subject to the liquidation requirements in effect at the time that a liquidation action is taken. An SBA Lender or Intermediary must maintain sufficient documentation to demonstrate that Loan Program Requirements have been satisfied.
