(ii) Two firms approved by SBA to be a mentor and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; under § 125.9 of this chapter may joint venture as a small business for any Federal government prime contract or subcontract, provided the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement, and the joint venture meets the requirements of § 124.513 (c) and (d), § 125.8(b) and (c), § 128.402(c) and (d), § 126.616(c) and (d), or § 127.506(c) and (d) of this chapter, as appropriate.
