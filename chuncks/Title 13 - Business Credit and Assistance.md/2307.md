####### SBA's notice of final agency decision on a formal enforcement action where no filed objection or untimely objection not considered.

(4)If SBA chooses not to consider an untimely objection or if the affected SBA Lender or Intermediary fails to file a written objection to a proposed formal enforcement action or an immediate suspension, and if SBA continues to believe that such proposed formal enforcement action or immediate suspension is appropriate, SBA must issue a written notice of final agency decision to the affected SBA Lender or Intermediary that SBA is undertaking one or more of the proposed formal enforcement actions against the SBA Lender or Intermediary or that an immediate suspension of the SBA Lender or Intermediary will continue. Such a notice of final agency decision need not state any grounds for the action other than to reference the SBA Lender's or Intermediary's failure to file a timely objection, and represents the final agency decision.
