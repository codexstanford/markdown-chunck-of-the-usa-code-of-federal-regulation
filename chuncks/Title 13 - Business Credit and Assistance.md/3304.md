##### ยง 126.618 How does a certified HUBZone small business concern's participation in a Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; relationship affect its participation in the HUBZone Program?

(a) A certified HUBZone small business concern may enter into a mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; relationship under ยง 125.9 of this chapter or in connection with a mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; program of another agency, provided that such relationships do not conflict with the HUBZone requirements described in ยง 126.200.

(b) For purposes of determining whether an applicant to the HUBZone Program or a certified HUBZone small business concern qualifies as small under part 121 of this chapter, SBA will not find affiliation between the applicant or certified HUBZone small business concern and the firm that is its mentor in an SBA-approved mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; relationship (including a mentor that is other than small) on the basis of the mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreement or the assistance provided to the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm under the agreement. SBA will not consider the employees of the mentor in determining whether the applicant or certified HUBZone small business concern meets (or continues to meet) the 35% HUBZone residency requirement or the principal office requirement, or in determining the size of the applicant or certified HUBZone small business concern for any employee-based size standard.

(c) A certified HUBZone small business concern that is a prime contractor on a HUBZone contract may subcontract work to its mentor.

(1) The certified HUBZone small business concern must meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting requirements set forth in ยง 125.6(c) of this chapter.
