###### ยง 120.193 Reconsideration after denial.

An applicant or recipient of a business loan may request reconsideration of a denied loan or loan modification request within 6 months of denial. Applicants denied due to a size determination can appeal that determination under part 121 of this chapter. All others must be submitted to the office that denied the original request. To prevail, the applicant must demonstrate that it has overcome all legitimate reasons for denial. Six months after denial, a new application is required. If the reconsideration is denied, a second and final reconsideration may be considered by the Director, Office of Financial Assistance (D/FA), whose decision is final.
