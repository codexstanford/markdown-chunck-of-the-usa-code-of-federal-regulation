##### ยง 126.613 How does a price evaluation preference affect the bid of a certified HUBZone small business concern in full and open competition?
###### Example 3

(iii):

In a full and open competition, a certified HUBZone small business concern submits an offer of $98 and a non-HUBZone small business concern submits an offer of $93. The CO would not apply the price evaluation preference in this procurement because the lowest, responsive, responsible offeror is a SBC.
