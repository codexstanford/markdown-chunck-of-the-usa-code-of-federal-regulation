####### How to compute the Maximum Tax Liability.

(b)(1) You may compute your Maximum Tax Liability for a full fiscal year or for any calendar quarter. Use the following formula:

(2) You may compute the highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rate on ordinary income and capital gains using either individual or corporate rates. However, you must apply the same type of rate, either individual or corporate, to both ordinary income and capital gains.

(3) In determining the combined Federal and State income tax rate, you must assume that State income taxes are deductible from Federal income taxes. For example, if the Federal tax rate was 35 percent and the State tax rate was 5 percent, the combined tax rate would be [35% x (1-.05)] + 5% = 38.25%.

(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b), the "State income tax" is that of the State where your principal place of business is located, and does not include any local income taxes.
