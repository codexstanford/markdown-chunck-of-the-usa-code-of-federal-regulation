###### False statements.

(b)If, during the processing of an application, SBA determines, by a preponderance of the evidence standard, that an Applicant or its representative has knowingly submitted false information, regardless of whether correct information would cause SBA to deny the application, and regardless of whether correct information was given to SBA in accompanying documents, SBA will deny the application. If, after certifying a Participant, SBA discovers that a firm or its representative knowingly submitted false information, SBA will initiate proceedings to decertify the Participant and remove it from the certification database pursuant to ยง 128.310. Whenever SBA determines that the Applicant or representative of an Applicant submitted false information, the matter will be referred to the SBA Office of Inspector General for review. In addition, SBA may request that Government-wide debarment proceedings be initiated by the agency.
