##### ยง 126.803 How will SBA process a HUBZone status protest and what are the possible outcomes?
###### Time period for determination.

(c)(1) SBA will determine the HUBZone status of the protested concern within 15 business days after receipt of a complete protest referral.

(2) If SBA does not issue its determination within 15 business days (or request an extension that is granted), the contracting officer may award the contract if he or she determines in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government. Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section apply to the procurement in question.
