###### ยง 127.300 How is a concern certified as an WOSB or EDWOSB?
####### EDWOSB certification.

(b)(1) A concern may apply to SBA for EDWOSB certification. There is no cost to apply to SBA for certification. SBA will consider the information provided by the concern in order to determine whether the concern qualifies. SBA, in its discretion, may rely solely upon the information submitted to establish eligibility, may request additional information, or may verify the information before making a determination. SBA may draw an adverse inference and deny the certification where the concern fails to cooperate with SBA or submit information requested by SBA.

(2) A concern that is a certified participant in the 8(a) BD Program and owned and controlled by one or more women qualifies as an EDWOSB.

(3) A concern may submit evidence to SBA that it is an economically disadvantaged women-owned and controlled small business that is certified by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Verification and Evaluation as a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Business or Veteran-Owned Business.

(4) A concern may submit evidence that it has been certified as an EDWOSB by a Third-Party Certifier under this subpart.
