If the surety fails to submit this form within the time period or the guarantee fees are not paid in accordance with ยง 115.32, SBA's guarantee of the bond will be void from its inception unless SBA determines otherwise upon a showing that the Contract is not in default and a valid reason exists why the timely submission was not made.
