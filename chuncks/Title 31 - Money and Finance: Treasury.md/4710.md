####### ยง 344.7 What are Demand Deposit securities?
######## What happens to Demand Deposit securities during a Debt Limit Contingency?

(b)At any time the Secretary determines that issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, we will invest any unredeemed Demand Deposit securities in special ninety-day certificates of indebtedness. Funds invested in the ninety-day certificates of indebtedness earn simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time Demand Deposit security issuance is suspended, multiplied by the number of days outstanding. When regular Treasury borrowing operations resume, the ninety-day certificates of indebtedness, at the owner's option, are:

(1) Payable at maturity;

(2) Redeemable before maturity, provided funds are available for redemption; or

(3) Reinvested in Demand Deposit securities.
