####### ยง 315.31 Series H bonds.
######## General.

(a)Series H bonds are current income bonds issued at par (face amount). Interest on a Series H bond is paid semiannually beginning six months from the issue date. Interest ceases at final maturity, or if the bond is redeemed prior to final maturity, as of the end of the interest period last preceding the date of redemption. For example, if a bond on which interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 is redeemed on September 1, interest ceases as of the preceding July 1, and no interest will be paid for the period from July 1 to September 1. However, if the redemption date falls on an interest payment date, interest ceases on that date. Information regarding authorized extended maturity periods and investment yields is found in Department Circular No. 905, current revision (31 CFR part 332).
