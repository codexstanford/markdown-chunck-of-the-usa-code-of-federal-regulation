######## ยง 363.141 How do I purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness?
######### Primary and linked accounts.

(a)You may purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness through one or more of the following four methods:

(1) Payroll deduction, in which your employer sends funds through the ACH method to your TreasuryDirect&#xAE; account;

(2) Deposit by your financial institution, in which your financial institution sends funds by the ACH method to your TreasuryDirect&#xAE; account on a recurring or one-time basis;

(3) Through the Buy Direct function of your TreasuryDirect&#xAE; account, in which you direct us to debit funds from your financial institution account to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness. This method is limited to an amount no greater than $1000 per transaction. When you use the Buy Direct function to debit funds to purchase all or a portion of a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness, you will not be permitted to schedule a redemption to your financial institution from the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness within five business days after the settlement date of the debit entry; and

(4) By using the proceeds from the redemption of a savings bond, the proceeds of a maturing security, or an interest payment from a security to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness.
