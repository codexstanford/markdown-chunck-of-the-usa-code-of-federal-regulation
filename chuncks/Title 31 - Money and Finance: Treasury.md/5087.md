######## Purchaser or officer under levy.

(a)The Department of the Treasury will pay (but not reissue) a savings bond to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized under appropriate process to levy upon property of the registered owner or coowner to satisfy a money judgment. Payment will be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment. The amount paid is limited to the redemption value 60 days after the termination of the judicial proceedings. Except in a case of a levy by the Internal Revenue Service, payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a judgment or a levy against only one coowner is limited to the extent of that coowner's interest in the bond. That interest must be established by an agreement between the coowners by judgment, decree, or order of a court in a proceeding to which both coowners are parties. Payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to levy by the Internal Revenue Service will be made if the levy is against either coowner on the bond.
