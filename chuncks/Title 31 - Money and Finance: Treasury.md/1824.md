#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Golden parachute payment.,General rule.

(1)The term "golden parachute payment" means any payment for the departure from a TARP recipient for any reason, or any payment due to a change in control of the TARP recipient or any entity that is included in a group of entities treated as one TARP recipient, except for payments for services performed or benefits accrued. For this purpose, a change in control includes any event that would qualify as a change in control event as defined in 26 CFR 1.280G-1, Q&A-27 through Q&A-29 or as a change in control event as defined in 26 CFR 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i). For this purpose, a golden parachute payment includes the acceleration of vesting due to the departure or the change in control event, as applicable. A golden parachute payment is treated as paid at the time of departure or change in control event, and is equal to the aggregate present value of all payments made for a departure or a change in control event (including the entire aggregate present value of the payment if the vesting period was not otherwise completed but was accelerated due to departure, regardless of whatever portion of the required vesting period the employee had completed). Thus, a golden parachute payment may include a right to amounts actually payable after the TARP period.
