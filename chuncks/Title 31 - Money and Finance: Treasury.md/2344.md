###### Insured loss.

(n)(1) The term insured loss means any loss resulting from an act of terrorism (including an act of war, in the case of workers' compensation) that is covered by primary or excess property and casualty insurance issued by an insurer if the loss:

(i) Occurs within the United States;

(ii) Occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), or to a United States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), regardless of where the loss occurs; however, to the extent a loss occurs to such an air carrier or vessel outside the United States, the insured loss does not include losses covered by third party insurance contracts that are separate from the insurance coverage provided to the air carrier or vessel; or

(iii) Occurs at the premises of any United States mission.

(2) The term insured loss includes reasonable loss adjustment expenses, incurred by an insurer in connection with insured losses, that are allocated and identified by claim file in insurer records, including expenses incurred in the investigation, adjustment, and defense of claims, but excluding staff salaries, overhead, and other insurer expenses that would have been incurred notwithstanding the insured loss.

(3) The term insured loss does not include:

(i) Punitive or exemplary damages awarded or paid in connection with the Federal cause of action specified in section 107(a)(1) of the Act. The term "punitive or exemplary damages" means damages that are not compensatory but are an award of money made to a claimant solely to punish or deter; or

(ii) Extra-contractual damages awarded against, or paid by, an insurer; or

(iii) Payments by an insurer in excess of policy limits; or

(iv) Amounts paid by a policyholder as required under the terms and conditions of property and casualty insurance issued by an insurer.
