####### ยง 363.20 What do I need to know about the forms of registration that are available for purchases of securities through my TreasuryDirect &#xAE; account?
######## The estate of a living person such as an incompetent or a minor.

(7)A form of registration is available for an individual or organization that has been appointed according to state law to act on behalf of the estate of an incompetent person, a minor, or other living person. This form of registration is not available where the legal guardian is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The entity account manager must be a court-appointed legal guardian who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account, or an employee of the court-appointed organizational legal guardian who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account on behalf of the organization in its role as legal guardian. Registration example: "John Doe, Legal Guardian of the estate of William Jones." The SSN of the incompetent person or the minor will be used.
