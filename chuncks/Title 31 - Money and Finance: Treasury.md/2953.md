####### ยง 205.27 How are Interest Calculation Costs calculated?
######## Eligibility and treatment of Interest Calculation Costs.

(d)(1) Interest Calculation Costs do not include expenses for normal disbursing services, such as processing checks or maintaining records for accounting and reconciliation of cash accounts, or expenses for upgrading or modernizing accounting systems.

(2) Interest Calculation Costs in excess of $50,000 in any year are not eligible for reimbursement, unless a State can justify to us that the State is unable to develop and maintain clearance patterns in support of interest calculations, or perform the actual calculation of interest, without incurring such costs. Supporting documentation must accompany State requests for reimbursement in excess of $50,000.

(3) Interest Calculation Costs that a State incurs in fiscal years prior to its most recently completed Annual Report are not eligible for reimbursement.

(4) A State must not include Interest Calculation Costs in its Statewide cost allocation plan, as defined and provided for in OMB Circular A-87. All costs incurred by a State to implement this subpart A, other than Interest Calculation Costs, are subject to the procedures and principles of OMB Circular A-87.

(e) The payments from the Federal government to individual States to offset Interest Calculation Costs incurred are funded from the aggregate interest payments States make to the Federal government. The following limitations apply:

(1) We will not reduce or adjust interest liabilities for Federal assistance programs funded out of trust funds for which the Secretary is trustee. These programs include, but are not limited to, Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund (CFDA 17.225); Highway & Planning Trust Fund (CFDA 20.205); Airport Improvement Trust Fund (CFDA 20.106); Federal Transit Capital Improvement Trust Fund (CFDA 20.500); Federal Transit Capital & Operating Assistance Trust Fund (CFDA 20.507); and Social Security-Disability Insurance Trust Fund (CFDA 96.001); and

(2) The aggregate payments from the Federal government to States to offset Interest Calculation Costs will not be greater than the aggregate interest payments States make to the Federal government.
