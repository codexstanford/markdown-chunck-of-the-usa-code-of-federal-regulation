##### TARP recipient.,General definition.

(1)The term "TARP recipient" means

(i) Any entity that has received or holds a commitment to receive financial assistance; and

(ii) Any entity that would be treated as the same employer as an entity receiving financial assistance based on the rules in sections 414(b) and 414(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 414(b) or (c)), but modified by substituting "50%" for "80%" in each place it appears in section 414(b) or 414(c) and the accompanying regulations. However, for purposes of applying the aggregation rules to determine the applicable employer, the rules for brother-sister controlled groups and combined groups are disregarded (including disregarding the rules in section 1563(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 1563(a)(2) and (a)(3)) with respect to corporations and the parallel rules that are in 26 CFR 1.414(c)-2(c) with respect to other organizations conducting trades or businesses).
