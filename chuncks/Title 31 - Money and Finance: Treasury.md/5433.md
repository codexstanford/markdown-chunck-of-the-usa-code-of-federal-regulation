###### Appendix A to Part 356 - Bidder Categories
####### Partnership

(b)-We consider a partnership to be one bidder if it is a partnership for which the Internal Revenue Service has assigned a tax-identification number. A partnership includes all of its affiliates, which may be persons, corporations, general partners acting on behalf of the partnership, or other entities. We use the term "partnership structure" to refer to the collection of affiliates that we consider collectively to be one bidder. We may consider a partnership structure that contains one or more corporations as a "partnership" or a "corporation," but not both.

An affiliate is any:

- Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by the partnership;

- Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by any other affiliate of the partnership;

- Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the partnership;

- Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of any other affiliate of the partnership; or

- Entity, a majority of whose general partners or a majority of whose board of directors are general partners or directors of the partnership or of any affiliate of the partnership.

An entity that is more than 50-percent owned as described in this definition is not an affiliate, however, if:

- The purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity;

- The owner does not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;

- The owner does not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;

- The partnership has written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent it from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and

- The partnership submits notice and certification to us, as provided in this appendix A.

A partnership that plans to make use of this exception to the definition of "affiliate" must inform us of this fact in writing and provide the following certification:

[Name of partnership] hereby certifies that, with regard to any entity of which it owns more than 50 percent as defined in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356, but for which the purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity:

- We do not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;

- We do not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;

- We have written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the partnership from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and

- We will continue to meet the terms of this certification until we notify the Treasury of a change.
