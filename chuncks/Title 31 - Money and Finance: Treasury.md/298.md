###### Processing a request for notification and access to records or a request for an accounting of disclosures.

(e)(i) If a request for notification and access (or request for an accounting of disclosures) omits any information which is essential to processing the request, the request will not be acted upon and the individual making the request will be promptly advised of the additional information which must be submitted before the request can be processed.

(ii) Within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of a request for notification and access (or a request for an accounting of disclosures), to a particular system of records by the designated official for such system, a determination will be made as to whether the particular system of records is exempt from the notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act, and if such system is not exempt, whether it does or does not contain a record pertaining to the individual making the request. If a determination cannot be made within 30 days, the individual will be notified of the delay, the reasons therefor, and the approximate time required to make a determination. If it is determined by the designated official that the particular system of records is exempt from the notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act, the individual making the request will be notified of the provisions of the Privacy Act under which the exemption is claimed. On the other hand, if it is determined by the designated official that the particular system of records is not exempted from the notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act and that such system contains a record pertaining to the individual making the request, the individual will be notified of the time and place where inspection may be made. If an individual has not requested that access be granted to inspect the record in person, but merely requests that a copy of the record be furnished, or if it is determined by the designated official that the granting of access to inspect a record in person is not feasible in a particular case, then the designated official will furnish a copy of the record with the notification, or if a copy cannot be furnished at such time, a statement indicating the approximate time such copy will be furnished. If the request is for an accounting of disclosures from a system of records which is not exempt from the accounting of disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act, the individual will be furnished with an accounting of such disclosures.
