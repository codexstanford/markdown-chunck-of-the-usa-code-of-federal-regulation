####### Example 8.

(8)Same facts as the example in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. Corporation B later releases a patch that updates the commercially available off-the-shelf software that is a component of SCADA System A. As the software is only a component of SCADA System A, the software itself is not covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation B does not perform one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to SCADA System A and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.
