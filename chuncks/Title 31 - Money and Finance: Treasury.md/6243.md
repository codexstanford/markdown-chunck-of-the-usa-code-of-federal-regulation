######## Message digest function

means an algorithm that transforms an electronic message into a seemingly unintelligible, generally smaller, result called the message digest. A message digest function has these qualities:

(1) The same electronic message yields the same message digest every time the algorithm is executed;

(2) It is computationally infeasible that an electronic message can be derived from the message digest result produced by the algorithm; and

(3) it is computationally infeasible that two electronic messages can be found that produce the same message digest using the algorithm.
