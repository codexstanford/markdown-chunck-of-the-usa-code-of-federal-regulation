A bond registered in the name of a purchaser with another person as coowner or beneficiary is not considered a gift or an award. If the purchaser so requests, a bond may be inscribed to provide a "Mail to" instruction, followed by a delivery name and address. No rights of ownership are conferred on such designee.
