#### ยง 30.14 Q-14: How does section 111 of EESA operate in connection with an acquisition, merger, or reorganization?
##### Special rules for acquisitions, mergers, or reorganizations.

(a)In the event that a TARP recipient (target) is acquired by an entity that is not an affiliate of the target (acquirer) in an acquisition of any form, including a purchase of substantially all of the assets of the target, such that the acquirer after the transaction would have been treated as a TARP recipient if the target had received the TARP funds immediately after the transaction, acquirer will not become subject to section 111 of EESA merely as a result of the acquisition. If the acquirer is not subject to section 111 of EESA immediately after the transaction, then any employees of the acquirer immediately after the transaction (including target employees who were SEOs or most highly compensated employees immediately prior to the transaction and became acquirer employees as a result of the transaction) will not be subject to section 111 of EESA.
