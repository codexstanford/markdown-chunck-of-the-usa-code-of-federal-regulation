###### Providing premium pay to eligible workers.

(c)A recipient may use funds to provide premium pay to eligible workers of the recipient who perform essential work or to provide grants to eligible employers that have eligible workers who perform essential work, provided that any premium pay or grants provided under this paragraph (c) must respond to eligible workers performing essential work during the COVID-19 public health emergency. A recipient uses premium pay or grants provided under this paragraph (c) to respond to eligible workers performing essential work during the COVID-19 public health emergency if:

(1) The eligible worker's total wages and remuneration, including the premium pay, is less than or equal to 150 percent of the greater of such eligible worker's residing State's or county's average annual wage for all occupations as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics;

(2) The eligible worker is not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime provisions (29 U.S.C. 207); or

(3) The recipient has submitted to the Secretary a written justification that explains how providing premium pay to the eligible worker is responsive to the eligible worker performing essential work during the COVID-19 public health emergency (such as a description of the eligible workers' duties, health, or financial risks faced due to COVID-19, and why the recipient determined that the premium pay was responsive despite the worker's higher income).
