######## Actual or Constructive Knowledge of Death.

(b)Actual or constructive knowledge, when used in reference to an RDFI's or agency's knowledge of the death or incapacity of a recipient or death of a beneficiary, means that the RDFI or agency received information, by whatever means, of the death or incapacity and has had a reasonable opportunity to act on such information or that the RDFI or agency would have learned of the death or incapacity if it had followed commercially reasonable business practices. For purposes of this subpart, an agency is presumed to have constructive knowledge of death or incapacity at the time it stops certifying recurring payments to a recipient if the agency:

(1) Does not re-initiate payments to the recipient; and

(2) Subsequently initiates a reclamation for one or more payments made to the recipient.
