####### Example 8.

(8)Corporation A, a foreign person, pays $5,000,000 to acquire 100,000 shares and call options from Corporation B, a U.S. business. The call options can be exercised after 90 days, and if exercised, Corporation A will have the right to acquire another 60,000 shares of Corporation B in exchange for an additional $3,000,000. Because the options may be exercised imminently, conversion of the call options is in the control of Corporation A, and the consideration for the interest acquired as a result of conversion can be reasonably determined, the value of the transaction includes the consideration for the shares and the call options as well as the consideration paid to exercise the options. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the consideration is $8,000,000, and the filing fee is $7,500.

(g) The determination of the value of the transaction for purposes of calculating the filing fee in no way limits the Committee's jurisdiction or its authority to review, investigate, mitigate, impose penalties regarding, or take any other action regarding any covered transaction.
