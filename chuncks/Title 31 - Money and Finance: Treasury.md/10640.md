####### Example 2.

(2)Same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that instead of customer approval rights, Corporation A has the right to decide whether to claim certain tax credits with respect to Terminal B on its own income tax filing, which prevents Corporation B from claiming such credits. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed investment does not afford Corporation A involvement in substantive decisionmaking of Corporation B regarding the management, operation, manufacture, or supply of covered investment critical infrastructure.
