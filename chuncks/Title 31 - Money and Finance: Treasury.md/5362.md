####### ยง 356.13 When must I report my net long position and how do I calculate it?
######## Net long position reporting threshold.,See

(a)(1) If you are bidding competitively in an auction, you must report your net long position when the total of your bids plus your net long position in the security being auctioned equals or exceeds the net long position reporting threshold (table.). We will specify this threshold in the auction announcement for each security (See ยง 356.10.). The threshold is typically 35 percent of the offering amount, but we may state a different threshold in the auction announcement. To see whether you must report your net long position, follow this table:

(2) Also, if you have more than one bid in an auction and you must report either your net long position or a zero, you must report that figure only once. Finally, if you are a customer and must report either your net long position or a zero, you must report that figure through only one depository institution or dealer. (See ยง 356.14(d).)
