#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Primary regulatory agency.

The term "primary regulatory agency" means the Federal regulatory agency that has primary supervisory authority over the TARP recipient. For a TARP recipient that is a State-chartered bank that does not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws, the primary regulatory agency is the TARP recipient's primary Federal banking regulator. If a TARP recipient is not subject to the supervision of a Federal regulatory agency, the term "primary regulatory agency" means the Treasury.
