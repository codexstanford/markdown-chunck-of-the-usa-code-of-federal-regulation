####### In general.

(1)The availability of information and documents through discovery is subject to the assertion of privileges available to the parties and witnesses. Privileges available to the Director and the Department include exemptions afforded pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) through (9)) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the merits of the pending action, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of any persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the Administrative Law Judge may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceeding. Relevant information need not be admissible at the hearing if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
