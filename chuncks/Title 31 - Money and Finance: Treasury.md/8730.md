####### et seq.,et seq.

A person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701) has an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which it owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701), regardless of whether the entity itself is listed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.
