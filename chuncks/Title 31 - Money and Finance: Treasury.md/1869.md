##### Application to private TARP recipients.

(c)The rules provided in paragraph (a) of this section are also applicable to TARP recipients that do not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws. A TARP recipient that does not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws and has received $25,000,000 or less in financial assistance is subject to paragraph (a) of this section, except that, in lieu of establishing and maintaining a compensation committee, such a TARP recipient is permitted to ensure that all the members of the board of directors carry out the duties of the compensation committee as described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, such a TARP recipient will be required to establish and maintain a compensation committee satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the first fiscal year following a fiscal year during which the TARP recipient either registers securities with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws or has received more than $25,000,000 in financial assistance, and during subsequent years of the TARP period.
