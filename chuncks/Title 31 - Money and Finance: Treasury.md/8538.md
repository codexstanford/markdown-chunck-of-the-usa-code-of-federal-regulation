###### § 560.425 Entities owned by one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked.

(a) Persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 560.211 have an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which such persons directly or indirectly own, whether individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 560.211, regardless of whether the entity itself is identified as a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 560.211.

(b) This section, which deals with the consequences of ownership of entities, in no way limits the definition of the Government of Iran in § 560.304.
