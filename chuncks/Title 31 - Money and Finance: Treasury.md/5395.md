## Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Money and Finance
### Chapter II - Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury
#### Subchapter A - Bureau of the Fiscal Service
##### PART 356 - SALE AND ISSUE OF MARKETABLE BOOK-ENTRY TREASURY BILLS, NOTES, AND BONDS (DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY CIRCULAR, FISCAL SERVICE SERIES NO. 1-93)
###### Subpart C - Determination of Auction Awards; Settlement
####### ยง 356.22 Does the Treasury have any limitations on auction awards?
######## Awards to competitive bidders.

(b)The maximum award is 35 percent of the offering amount less the bidder's net long position as reportable under ยง 356.13. For example, in a note auction with a $10 billion offering amount, and therefore a maximum award of $3.5 billion, a bidder with a reported net long position of $1 billion could receive a maximum auction award of $2.5 billion. When the bids and net long positions of more than one person or entity must be combined, as is the case with investment advisers and controlled accounts (See ยง 356.15(c).), we will use this combined amount for the purpose of this 35 percent award limit.
