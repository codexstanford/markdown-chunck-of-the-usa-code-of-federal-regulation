#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Excessive or luxury expenditures policy.

The term "excessive or luxury expenditures policy" means written standards applicable to the TARP recipient and its employees that address the four categories of expenses set forth in the definition of "excessive or luxury expenditures" (entertainment or events, office and facility renovations, aviation or other transportation services, and other similar items, activities or events), and that are reasonably designed to eliminate excessive and luxury expenditures. Such written standards must:

(1) Identify the types or categories of expenditures which are prohibited (which may include a threshold expenditure amount per item, activity, or event or a threshold expenditure amount per employee receiving the item or participating in the activity or event);

(2) Identify the types or categories of expenditures for which prior approval is required (which may include a threshold expenditure amount per item, activity, or event or a threshold expenditure amount per employee receiving the item or participating in the activity or event);

(3) Provide reasonable approval procedures under which an expenditure requiring prior approval may be approved;

(4) Require PEO and PFO certification that the approval of any expenditure requiring the prior approval of any SEO, any executive officer of a substantially similar level of responsibility, or the TARP recipient's board of directors (or a committee of such board of directors), was properly obtained with respect to each such expenditure;

(5) Require the prompt internal reporting of violations to an appropriate person or persons identified in this policy; and

(6) Mandate accountability for adherence to this policy.
