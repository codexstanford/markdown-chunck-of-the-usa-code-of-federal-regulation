(a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this part results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from the Government of Syria or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 542.201(a), such property shall no longer be deemed to be property blocked pursuant to § 542.201(a), unless there exists in the property another interest that is blocked pursuant to § 542.201(a), the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.

(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to the Government of Syria or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 542.201(a), such property shall be deemed to be property in which such a person has an interest and therefore blocked.
