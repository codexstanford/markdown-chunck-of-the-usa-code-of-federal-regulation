### PART 30 - TARP STANDARDS FOR COMPENSATION AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
#### ยง 30.7 Q-7: How does a TARP recipient comply with the certification and disclosure requirements under ยง 30.4 (Q-4) of this part?
##### Certification.

(a)The compensation committee must provide the certifications required by ยง 30.4 (Q-4) of this part stating that it has reviewed, with the TARP recipient's senior risk officers, the SEO compensation plans to ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks, the employee compensation plans to limit any unnecessary risks these plans pose to the TARP recipient, and the employee compensation plans to eliminate any features of these plans that would encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP recipient to enhance the compensation of any employee. For any period during which no obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding, the requirements under this paragraph shall be modified to be consistent with ยง 30.4(d) (Q-4(d)). Providing a statement similar to the following and in the manner provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as applicable, would satisfy this standard: "The compensation committee certifies that:

(1) It has reviewed with senior risk officers the senior executive officer (SEO) compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of [identify TARP recipient];

(2) It has reviewed with senior risk officers the employee compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to limit any unnecessary risks these plans pose to the [identify TARP recipient]; and

(3) It has reviewed the employee compensation plans to eliminate any features of these plans that would encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of [identify TARP recipient] to enhance the compensation of any employee."
