####### Government-related entity

(c)-We consider each of the following entities to be one bidder:

(1) A state government or the government of the District of Columbia

(2) A unit of local government, including any county, city, municipality, or township, or other unit of general government as defined by the Bureau of the Census for statistical purposes.

(3) A commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.

(4) A governmental entity, body, or corporation established under Federal, State, or local law.

(5) A foreign central bank, the government of a foreign state, or an international organization in which the United States holds membership. This type of entity applies only when such entity is not using an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (See paragraph (f).).

We generally consider an investment, reserve, or other fund of one of the above government-related entities as part of that entity and not a separate bidder. We will consider a government-related entity's fund to be a separate bidder if it meets the definition of the "trust or other fiduciary estate" category, or if applicable law requires that the investments of such fund be made separately.
