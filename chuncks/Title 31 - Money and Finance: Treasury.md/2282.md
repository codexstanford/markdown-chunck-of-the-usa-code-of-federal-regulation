## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of the Treasury
### PART 35 - PANDEMIC RELIEF PROGRAMS
#### Subpart B - Compensation and Capital Distributions
##### ยง 35.23 Restrictions on dividends, share buybacks, and other capital distributions.
###### Limit on amount of capital distributions.

(b)(1) If an ECIP recipient is an insured depository institution, bank holding company, or savings and loan holding company, the ECIP recipient shall obtain the approval of the Department of the Treasury prior to making any capital distribution if the total of capital distributions made during the calendar year, including the proposed capital distribution, exceeds its eligible distributable income; provided, however, that any prior approval of a capital distribution by the Department of the Treasury does not supersede any applicable regulatory requirements of the ECIP recipient's appropriate Federal banking agency, or other actions taken by such agency. For purposes of this paragraph, "eligible distributable income" means the sum of the ECIP recipient's reported year-to-date net income as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter, plus net income for the two preceding calendar years, less any dividends or distributions for the year to date as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter and the two preceding calendar years, where each amount is calculated in accordance with the instructions to the Call Report or applicable reporting form.

(2) If the ECIP recipient is federally insured credit union, the ECIP recipient shall obtain the Department of the Treasury's prior approval to make any capital distributions if the distribution would:

(i) In the case of a dividend, be payable from retained earnings (as defined in 12 CFR 702.2(f)) other than undivided earnings; or

(ii) Cause the ECIP recipient's net worth classification to fall below "adequately capitalized" (as defined in 12 CFR 702.102(a)(2)).
