####### ยง 356.31 How does the STRIPS program work?
######## Interest components.

(3)Interest components stripped from non-indexed securities have the following features:

(i) They are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their original payment value, which is derived by multiplying the semiannual interest rate and the par amount;

(ii) Their interest payment date becomes the maturity date for the component;

(iii) All interest components with the same maturity date have the same CUSIP number, regardless of the underlying security from which the interest payments were stripped, and therefore are fungible (interchangeable).

(iv) the CUSIP numbers of interest components are different from the CUSIP numbers of principal components and fully constituted securities, even if they have the same maturity date, and therefore are not fungible.
