### PART 30 - TARP STANDARDS FOR COMPENSATION AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
#### ยง 30.14 Q-14: How does section 111 of EESA operate in connection with an acquisition, merger, or reorganization?
##### Anti-abuse rule.

(b)Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if the primary purpose of a transaction involving the acquisition, in any form, of a TARP recipient is to avoid or evade the application of any of the requirements of section 111 of EESA, the acquirer will be treated as a TARP recipient immediately upon such acquisition. In such a case, the SEOs and the most highly compensated employees to whom any of the requirements of section 111 of EESA and this Interim Final Rule apply shall be redetermined as of the date of the acquisition. The redetermined SEOs and most highly compensated employees of the post-acquisition acquirer shall consist of the PEO and PFO of the post-acquisition acquirer, plus the applicable number of next most highly compensated employees determined by aggregating the post-acquisition employees of the acquirer (to include the pre-acquisition employees of the target employed by the acquirer, or anticipated to be employed by the acquirer), and ranking such employees in order of compensation for the immediately preceding fiscal year of the pre-acquisition target or pre-acquisition acquirer, as appropriate. In the case of an asset acquisition, the entity or entities to whom the target's assets are transferred shall be treated as the direct recipient of the financial assistance for purposes of determining which other related entities are treated, in the aggregate, as the TARP recipient under the definition of "TARP recipient" in ยง 30.1 (Q-1).
