####### Example 2.

(2)Corporation A, a U.S. business, produces an item (Item A) by purchasing various components from third-party suppliers and integrating them into Item A. One of these components (Component X) is a critical technology, but Item A is not a critical technology. Before integrating Component X into Item A, Corporation A merely verifies the fit and form of Component X solely as part of Item A. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not test critical technologies and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.
