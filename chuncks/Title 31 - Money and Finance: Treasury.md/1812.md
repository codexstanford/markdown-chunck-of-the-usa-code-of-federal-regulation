##### Compensation structure.

The term "compensation structure" means the characteristics of the various forms of total compensation that an employee receives or may receive, including the amounts of such compensation or potential compensation relative to the amounts of other types of compensation or potential compensation, the amounts of such compensation or potential compensation relative to the total compensation over the relevant period, and how such various forms of compensation interrelate to provide the employee his or her ultimate total compensation. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, whether the compensation is provided as salary, short-term incentive compensation, or long-term incentive compensation, whether the compensation is provided as cash compensation, equity-based compensation, or other types of compensation (such as executive pensions, other benefits or perquisites), and whether the compensation is provided as current compensation or deferred compensation.
