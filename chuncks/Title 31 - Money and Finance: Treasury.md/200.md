###### Requests for records not in control of component.

(e)(1) Treasury employees must make reasonable efforts to assist an oral requester to learn to which office or officer a written request should be sent. When the request is for a record which is not in the possession or control of any Treasury component, the requester must be advised of this fact.

(2) Where the record requested originated with a Federal agency other than Treasury or its components and was classified (e.g., National Defense or Intelligence Information) or otherwise restrictively endorsed (e.g., Office of Personnel Management records of Federal Bureau of Investigation reports) by the originating agency, and a copy is in the possession of a Treasury component, the component will refer that portion of the request to the originating agency for determination of all Privacy Act issues. In the case of a referral to another agency under this paragraph (e)(2), the component will notify the requester that such portion of the request has been so referred and that the requester may expect to hear from that agency.
