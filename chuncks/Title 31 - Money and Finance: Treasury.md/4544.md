####### [object Object]

(a)A Retirement Plan Bond will be redeemable at its current redemption value upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), provided he is 59years of age or older. The owner's age will be determined from the date of birth shown on the face of the bond, provided, however, that the Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right in any case or class of cases to require proof, in the form of a duly certified copy of his birth certificate, that the owner has attained the age of 59years. If such evidence is unavailable, one of the following documents may be furnished in lieu thereof:

(1) Church records of birth or baptism.

(2) Hospital birth record or certificate.

(3) Physician's or midwife's birth record.

(4) Certification of Bible or other family record.

(5) Military, naturalization or immigration records.

(6) Other evidence of probative value. Similar documentary evidence will also be required to support any claim made by an owner that the date of birth shown on his bond is incorrect.
