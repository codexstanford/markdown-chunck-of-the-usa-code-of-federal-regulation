######## Purchase of bonds.

(2)Bonds may be purchased only with assets credited to the accounts of participating employees and only if the amount taken from any account at any time for that purpose is equal to the purchase price of a $50 bond or bonds in an authorized denomination or denominations, and shares in the bonds are credited to the accounts of the individuals from which the purchase price was derived, in amounts corresponding with their shares. For example, if $100 credited to the account of John Jones is commingled with funds credited to the accounts of other employees to make a total of $5,000 with which a Series I bond in the denomination of $5,000 (face amount) is purchased in December 1998 and registered in the name and title of the trustee, the plan must provide, in effect, that John Jones' account be credited to show that he is the owner of a Series I bond in the denomination of $100 (face amount) bearing an issue date of December 1, 1998.
