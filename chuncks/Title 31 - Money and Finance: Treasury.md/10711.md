####### Example 2.

(2)The Committee concluded all action under section 721 with respect to a covered investment in which Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, acquired a four percent, non-controlling equity interest with board observer rights in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. One year later, Corporation A proposes to acquire an additional five percent equity interest in Corporation B, which would result in Corporation A holding a nine percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. The proposed investment does not afford Corporation A any additional access, rights, or involvement with respect to Corporation B, including the access, rights, or involvement specified in ยง 800.211(b). Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is not a covered investment.
