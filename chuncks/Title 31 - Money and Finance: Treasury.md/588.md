(a)(1) No attorney, certified public accountant or enrolled practitioner shall, with respect to any Bureau matter, in any way use or participate in the use of any form of public communication containing a false, fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, unduly influencing, coercive or unfair statement or claim. For the purposes of this subsection, the prohibition includes, but is not limited to, statements pertaining to the quality of services rendered unless subject to factual verification, claims of specialized expertise not authorized by State or Federal agencies having jurisdiction over the practitioner, and statements or suggestions that the ingenuity and/or prior record of a representative rather than the merit of the matter are principal factors likely to determine the result of the matter.

(2) No attorney, certified public accountant or enrolled practitioner shall make, directly or indirectly, an uninvited solicitation of employment, in matters related to the Bureau. Solicitation includes, but is not limited to, in-person contacts, telephone communications, and personal mailings directed to the specific circumstances unique to the recipient. This restriction does not apply to: (i) Seeking new business from an existing or former client in a related matter; (ii) solicitation by mailings, the contents of which are designed for the general public; or (iii) non-coercive in-person solicitation by those eligible to practice before the Bureau while acting as an employee, member, or officer of an exempt organization listed in sections 501(c) (3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C.).
