(c)If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor shall submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Treasury entity collecting the debt, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Treasury entity will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Treasury entity shall notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, the Treasury entity will notify the appropriate agency or other persons about the new terms.
