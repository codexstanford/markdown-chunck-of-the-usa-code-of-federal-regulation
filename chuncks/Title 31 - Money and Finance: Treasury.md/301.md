(h)An individual seeking notification or access to records, or seeking to amend a record, must satisfy one of the following identification requirements before action will be taken by the IRS on any such request:

(i) An individual seeking notification or access to records in person, or seeking to amend a record in person, may establish identity by the presentation of a single document bearing a photograph (such as a passport or identification badge) or by the presentation of two items of identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear both a name and signature (such as a driver's license or credit card).

(ii) An individual seeking notification or access to records by mail, or seeking to amend a record by mail, may establish identity by a signature, address, and one other identifier such as a photocopy of a driver's license or other document bearing the individual's signature.

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs 3(h)(i) and (ii) of this appendix, an individual seeking notification or access to records by mail or in person, or seeking to amend a record by mail or in person, who so desires, may establish identity by providing a notarized statement, swearing or affirming to such individual's identity and to the fact that the individual understands the penalties provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) for requesting or obtaining access to records under false pretenses.

(iv) Notwithstanding paragraph 3(h)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this appendix, a designated official may require additional proof of an individual's identity before action will be taken on any request if such official determines that it is necessary to protect unauthorized disclosure of information in a particular case. In addition, a parent of any minor or a legal guardian of any individual will be required to provide adequate proof of legal relationship before such person may act on behalf of such minor or such individual.
