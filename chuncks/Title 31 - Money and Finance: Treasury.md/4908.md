####### Series EE Savings Bonds With Issue Dates From May 1, 1995, Through April 1, 1997
######## ยง 351.28 How are redemption values calculated for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997?

We determine the redemption value of a bond on the accrual date immediately following each semiannual earning period as follows:

(a) We convert the applicable long-term or short-term savings bond rate for the semiannual earning period to decimal form by dividing by 100, and adjust it to a semiannual rate by dividing by 2.

(b) Using redemption values for the base denomination, as defined in ยง 351.16, we then multiply this rate by the redemption value of the bond at the beginning of the semiannual earning period.

(c) We add the resulting interest amount, rounded to the nearest cent, to the redemption value of the bond at the beginning of the earning period to produce the redemption value at the next semiannual accrual date. The redemption value of a bond remains constant between accrual dates.
