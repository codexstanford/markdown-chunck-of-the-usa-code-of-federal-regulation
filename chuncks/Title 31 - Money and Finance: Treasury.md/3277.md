####### Consideration of willful conduct.

(g)The company is not entitled to an opportunity to cure its noncompliance if its conduct in failing to carry out its contracts is willful. For purposes of this regulation, "willful" means a careless or reckless disregard of a known legal obligation to satisfy an administratively final bond obligation. In considering whether a company's conduct is willful, the Deciding Official may consider whether:

(1) An agency has filed a prior complaint with Treasury requesting that the company's certificate be revoked for a substantially similar bond obligation;

(2) The company asserted substantially similar defenses to such bond obligation;

(3) Such defenses were considered by the agency under pertinent authorities and dismissed;

(4) Treasury made a final decision that revocation of the company's certificate was justified; and

(5) Other pertinent factors.
