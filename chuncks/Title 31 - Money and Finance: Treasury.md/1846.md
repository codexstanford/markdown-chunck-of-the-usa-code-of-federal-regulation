(2)With respect to newly hired employees, a payment that will be made only if the new hire continues providing services for a specified period generally constitutes a retention award. For example, a signing bonus that must be repaid unless the newly hired employee completes a certain period of service is a retention award. Similarly, a "make-whole" agreement under which a newly hired employee is provided benefits intended to make up for benefits foregone at his former employer, where these new benefits are subject to a continued service period vesting requirement (such as a continuation of the vesting period at the former employer), is a retention award.
