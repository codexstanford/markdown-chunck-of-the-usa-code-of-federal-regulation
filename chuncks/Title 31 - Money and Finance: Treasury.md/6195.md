###### Subpart E - Conversion of a Definitive Savings Bond
####### ยง 363.169 What transactions can I conduct in a converted savings bond on which I am registered as the single owner, either coowner, the owner with a beneficiary, or an entity?
######## Remove a coowner from the registration.

(3)The converting coowner (or the non-converting coowner, if the bond has been previously transferred to the account of the non-converting coowner) may remove the other coowner from the registration. The consent of the other coowner is required. The bond must reside in the account of the coowner who is requesting the transaction. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond's registration will be changed to the single owner form of registration. Once this transaction is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.
