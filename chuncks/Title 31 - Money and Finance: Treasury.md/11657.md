####### Agents.

(3)A person that is a money services business solely because that person serves as an agent of another money services business, see ยง 1010.100(ff) of this chapter, is not required to register under this section, but a money services business that engages in activities described in ยง 1010.100(ff) of this chapter both on its own behalf and as an agent for others must register under this section. For example, a supermarket corporation that acts as an agent for an issuer of money orders and performs no other services of a nature and value that would cause the corporation to be a money services business, is not required to register; the answer would be the same if the supermarket corporation served as an agent both of a money order issuer and of a money transmitter. However, registration would be required if the supermarket corporation, in addition to acting as an agent of an issuer of money orders, cashed checks or exchanged currencies (other than as an agent for another business) in an amount greater than $1,000 in currency or monetary or other instruments for any person on any day, in one or more transactions.
