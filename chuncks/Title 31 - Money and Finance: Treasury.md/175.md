(3) Establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained. (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(10).)

(i) System managers, with the approval of the head of their offices within a component, shall establish administrative and physical controls, consistent with Department regulations in this part, to insure the protection of records systems from unauthorized access or disclosure and from physical damage or destruction. The controls instituted shall be proportional to the degree of sensitivity of the records but at a minimum must insure that records other than those available to the general public under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), are protected from public view, that the area in which the records are stored is supervised during all business hours and physically secure during nonbusiness hours to prevent unauthorized personnel from obtaining access to the records. Automated systems shall comply with the security standards promulgated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

(ii) System managers, with the approval of the head of their offices within a component, shall adopt access restrictions to insure that access to the records is limited to those individuals within the agency who have a need to access the records in order to perform their duties. Procedures shall also be adopted to prevent accidental access to, or dissemination of, records.
