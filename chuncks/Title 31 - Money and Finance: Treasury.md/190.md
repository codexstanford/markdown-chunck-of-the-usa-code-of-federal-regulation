###### Accounting systems.

(b)To permit the accounting required by paragraph (a) of this section, system managers, with the approval of the head of their offices within a component, must establish or implement a system of accounting for all disclosures of records, either orally or in writing, made outside the Department of the Treasury. Accounting records must:

(1) Be established in the least expensive and most convenient form that will permit the system manager to advise individuals, promptly upon request, what records concerning them have been disclosed and to whom;

(2) Provide, as a minimum, the identification of the particular record disclosed, the name and address of the person to whom or agency to which the record was disclosed, and the date, nature, and purpose of the disclosure; and

(3) Be maintained for 5 years or until the record is destroyed or transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration or Federal Records Center for storage, in which event, the accounting pertaining to those records, unless maintained separately, must be transferred with the records themselves.
