####### ยง 363.169 What transactions can I conduct in a converted savings bond on which I am registered as the single owner, either coowner, the owner with a beneficiary, or an entity?
######## Transfer to the beneficiary or a third party with a change in registration.

(4)The owner may remove his or her name from the registration and transfer the bond to the account of the beneficiary or a third party, with the consent of the beneficiary. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond will be transferred in the single owner form of registration. Once the transfer is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.
