4.An individual seeking notification or access to records, or seeking to amend a record, or seeking an accounting of disclosures, must satisfy one of the following identification requirements before action will be taken by FinCEN on any such request:

(i) An individual may establish identity through the mail by a signature, address, and one other identifier such as a photocopy of a driver's license or other official document bearing the individual's signature.

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph 4(i) of this section, an individual may establish identity by providing a notarized statement, swearing or affirming to such individual's identity and to the fact that the individual understands the penalties provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) for requesting or obtaining access to records under false pretenses.

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs 4(i) and (ii) of this appendix, the Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Officer or other designated official may require additional proof of an individual's identity before action will be taken on any request, if such official determines that it is necessary to protect against unauthorized disclosure of information in a particular case. In addition, a parent of any minor or a legal guardian of any individual will be required to provide adequate proof of legal relationship before such person may act on behalf of such minor or such individual.
