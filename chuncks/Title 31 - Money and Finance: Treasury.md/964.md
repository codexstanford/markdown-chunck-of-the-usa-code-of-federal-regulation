## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of the Treasury
### PART 13 - PROCEDURES FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN PROTECTING FOREIGN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS
#### § 13.7 Reimbursement when the Assistant Secretary makes no determination to utilize State and local government services, personnel, equipment and facilities.

(a) Where events require the State or local governments of the affected metropolitan area to provide protection to meet an extraordinary protective need otherwise qualifying for reimbursement, such reimbursement may be made even if the provisions of §§ 13.4 and 13.5 have not been complied with fully. In such circumstances the provisions of § 13.6 shall apply.

(b) In cases where State or local governments, or both, utilized their own services, personnel, equipment, and facilities to provide protection for an extraordinary protective need, and no request for protective assistance pursuant to § 13.4 was made because the extraordinary protective need occurred prior to the promulgation of this part but after July 1, 1974, an application by such government to the Assistant Secretary for reimbursement otherwise conforming to the requirements of this part will be considered.
