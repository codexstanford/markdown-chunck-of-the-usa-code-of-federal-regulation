######## Digital signature

means a type of electronic signature. A signer creates a digital signature by using public-key encryption to transform a message digest of an electronic message. If a recipient of the digital signature has an electronic message, message digest function, and the signer's public key, the recipient can verify:

(1) Whether the transformation was accomplished with the private key that corresponds to the signer's public key; and

(2) Whether the electronic message has been altered since the transformation was made.
