### PART 30 - TARP STANDARDS FOR COMPENSATION AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Payments for services performed or benefits accrued,General rules.

(3)-(i)Except as otherwise provided for payments made under a deferred compensation plan or a benefit plan in paragraph (4) of this definition, a payment made, or a right to a payment arising under a plan, contract, agreement, or other arrangement (including the acceleration of any vesting conditions) is for services performed or benefits accrued only if the payment was made, or the right to the payment arose, for current or prior services to the TARP recipient (except that an appropriate allowance may be made for services for a predecessor employer). Whether a payment is for services performed or benefits accrued is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. However, a payment, or a right to a payment, generally will be treated as a payment for services performed or benefits accrued only if the payment would be made regardless of whether the employee departs or the change in control event occurs, or if the payment is due upon the departure of the employee, regardless of whether the departure is voluntary or involuntary (other than reasonable restrictions, such as the forfeiture of the right to a payment for an involuntary departure for cause, but not restrictions relating to whether the departure was a voluntary departure for good reason or subsequent to a change in control).
