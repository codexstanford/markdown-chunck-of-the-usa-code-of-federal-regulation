#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Employee.

The term "employee" means an individual serving as a servant in the conventional master-servant relationship as understood by the common-law agency doctrine. In general, a partner of a partnership, a member of a limited liability company, or other similar owner in a similar type of entity, will not be treated as an employee for this purpose. However, to the extent that the primary purpose for the creation or utilization of such partnership, limited liability company, or other similar type of entity is to avoid or evade any or all of the requirements of section 111 of EESA or these regulations with respect to a partner, member or other similar owner, the partner, member or other similar owner will be treated as an employee. In addition, a personal service corporation or similar intermediary between the TARP recipient and an individual providing services to the TARP recipient will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether such individual is an employee of the TARP recipient.
