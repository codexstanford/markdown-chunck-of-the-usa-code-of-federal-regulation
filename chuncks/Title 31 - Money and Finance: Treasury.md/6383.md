####### Primary responsibility to report.

(2)A report may be filed on behalf of a holder of blocked property or a releaser of property from blocked status by an attorney, agent, or other person. Primary responsibility for reporting, however, rests with the actual holder or releaser of the property, or the person exercising control over property located outside the United States, with the following exceptions: Primary responsibility for reporting any trust assets rests with the trustee; and primary responsibility for reporting real property rests with any U.S. co-owner, legal representative, agent, or property manager in the United States. No person is excused from filing a report by reason of the fact that another person has submitted a report with regard to the same property, except upon actual knowledge of the report filed by such other person.
