### PART 30 - TARP STANDARDS FOR COMPENSATION AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Salary or other permissible payments paid in property.

(2)The term "incentive plan" does not include an arrangement under which an employee receives salary or another permissible payment in property, such as TARP recipient stock, provided that such property is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in 26 CFR 1.83-3(c)) or other future period of required services, the amount of the payment is determinable as a dollar amount through the date such compensation is earned (for example, an agreement that salary payments will be made in stock equal to the value of the cash payment that would otherwise be due), and the amount of stock or other property accrues at the same time or times as the salary or other permissible payments would otherwise be paid in cash. The term "incentive plan" also does not include an arrangement under which an employee receives a restricted stock unit that is analogous to TARP recipient stock, that otherwise meets the requirements of the previous sentence. For this purpose, a unit is analogous to stock if the unit is based upon stock of the TARP recipient, or is applied as if the applicable entity, division, or other unit were a corporation with one class of stock and the number of units of stock granted is determined based on a fixed percentage of the overall value of this corporation, and the term "TARP recipient stock" with respect to a particular employee recipient means the stock of a corporation (or the entity, division, or other unit the value of which forms the basis for the unit) that is an "eligible issuer of service recipient stock" under 26 CFR 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)(E) (applied by analogy to non-corporate entities).
