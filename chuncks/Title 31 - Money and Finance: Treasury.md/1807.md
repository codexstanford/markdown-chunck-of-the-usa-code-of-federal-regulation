(1)The term "commission compensation" means:

(i) Compensation or portions of compensation earned by an employee consistent with a program in existence for that type of employee as of February 17, 2009, if a substantial portion of the services provided by this employee consists of the direct sale of a product or service to an unrelated customer, these sales occur frequently and in the ordinary course of business of the TARP recipient (but not a specified transaction, such as an initial public offering or sale or acquisition of a specified entity or entities), the compensation paid by the TARP recipient to the employee consists of either a portion of the purchase price for the product or service sold to the unrelated customer or an amount substantially all of which is calculated by reference to the volume of sales to the unrelated customers, and payment of the compensation is either contingent upon the TARP recipient receiving payment from the unrelated customer for the product or service or, if applied consistently to all similarly situated employees, is contingent upon the closing of the sales transaction and such other requirements as may be specified by the TARP recipient before the closing of the sales transaction with the unrelated customer;

(ii) Compensation or portions of compensation earned by an employee that meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(i) of this definition except that the transaction occurs with a related customer, provided that substantial sales from which commission compensation arises are made, or substantial services from which commission compensation arises are provided, to unrelated customers by the service recipient, the sales and service arrangement and the commission arrangement with respect to the related customer are bona fide, arise from the service recipient's ordinary course of business, and are substantially the same, both in term and in practice, as the terms and practices applicable to unrelated customers to which individually or in the aggregate substantial sales are made or substantial services provided by the service recipient; or

(iii) Compensation or portions of compensation earned by an employee consistent with a program in existence for that type of employee as of February 17, 2009, if a substantial portion of the services provided by this employee to the TARP recipient consists of sales of financial products or other direct customer services with respect to unrelated customer assets or unrelated customer asset accounts that are generally intended to be held indefinitely (and not customer assets intended to be used for a specific transaction, such as an initial public offering, or sale or acquisition of a specified entity or entities), the unrelated customer retains the right to terminate the customer relationship and may move or liquidate the assets or asset accounts without undue delay (which may be subject to a reasonable notice period), the compensation consists of a portion of the value of the unrelated customer's overall assets or asset account balance, an amount substantially all of which is calculated by reference to the increase in the value of the overall assets or account balance during a specified period, or both, or is calculated by reference to a contractual benchmark (such as a securities index or peer results), and the value of the overall assets or account balance and commission compensation is determined at least annually. For purposes of this definition, a customer is treated as an unrelated customer if the person would not be treated as related to the TARP recipient under 26 CFR 1.409A-1(f)(2)(ii) and the person would not be treated as providing management services to the TARP recipient under 26 CFR 1.409A-1(f)(2)(iv).
