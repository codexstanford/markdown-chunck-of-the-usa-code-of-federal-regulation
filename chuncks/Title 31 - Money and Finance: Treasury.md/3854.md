######## Exemptions by the Secretary.

(f)(1) Upon the written request and recommendation of the head of the creditor agency to which a class of debts is owed, the Secretary may exempt any class of debts from affecting a debtor's eligibility for Federal financial assistance based on the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3720B and this section.

(2) The creditor agency recommending an exemption for a class of debts will provide the Secretary with information about:

(i) The nature of the program under which the delinquencies have arisen;

(ii) The number, dollar amount, and age of the debts in the program for which exemption is recommended;

(iii) The reasons why an exemption is justified, including why the granting of financial assistance to persons owing the type of debt for which exemption is requested would not be contrary to the Government's goal to reduce losses by requiring proper screening of potential borrowers; and,

(iv) Other information the Secretary deems necessary to consider the exemption request.

(3) The Secretary may exempt a class of debts if exemption is in the best interests of the Federal Government.
