(k)When conducting activities for or related to its Centralized Receivables Service or Cross-Servicing program, Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual's Social Security number will not be visible on the outside of any package it sends by physical mail or in the subject line of an email. In addition, Fiscal Service generally will redact or partially redact Social Security numbers in documents it sends by mail; however, to administer these programs, Fiscal Service may include Social Security numbers in mailed documents, including, for example:

(1) In interoffice and interagency communications;

(2) In communications with private collection contractor and agents that assist Fiscal Service in its debt collection activities;

(3) In notices and letters, including demand letters and notices to employers regarding wage garnishment, when the Social Security number is (or is embedded in) a creditor agency's account number, debt identification number, or debtor identification number;

(4) In notices to employers regarding wage garnishment;

(5) In response to a request of a debtor or a debtor's representative for records of Fiscal Service's collection activities; and

(6) When required by law.
