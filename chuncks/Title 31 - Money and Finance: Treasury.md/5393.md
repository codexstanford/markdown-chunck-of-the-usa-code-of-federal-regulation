####### ยง 356.21 How are awards at the high yield, discount rate, or discount margin calculated?
######## Awards to customers.

(b)The same prorating rules apply to customers as apply to submitters. Depository institutions and dealers, whether submitters or intermediaries, are responsible for prorating awards for their customers at the same percentage that we announce. For example, if 80.15% is the announced percentage at the highest yield, discount rate, or discount margin, then each customer bid at that yield, discount rate, or discount margin must be awarded 80.15%.
