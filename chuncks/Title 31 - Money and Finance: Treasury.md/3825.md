######## Legally enforceable

refers to a characteristic of a debt and means there has been a final agency determination that the debt, in the amount stated, is due, and there are no legal bars to collection. A debt would not be legally enforceable, for example, if the debt is:

(1) The subject of a pending administrative review required by a statute or regulation that prohibits collection action during the review process; or

(2) Governed by a statute that precludes collection.
