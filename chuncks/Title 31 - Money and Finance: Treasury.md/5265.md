###### ยง 355.9 What should I do if I recover a check reported as lost, stolen, destroyed, or not received?

If you recover the original check you must notify us in writing. If we have not yet issued a replacement check, we will remove the stop payment order against the original check. If we have already issued a replacement check, you must return the original check to us.
