####### ยง 363.10 What is a TreasuryDirect &#xAE; account?
######## Minor account.

(2)A minor account is an account established by an individual custodian for an individual who has not yet reached the age of 18 years. We do not permit an entity to open a minor account. A minor account is linked to the custodian's primary account. The minor is the owner of the securities, but the custodian controls the account on behalf of the minor. (See ยง 363.27 for more information about minor accounts.)
