By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601) (NEA), the Fentanyl Sanctions Act (21 U.S.C. 2301) (FSA), sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,

This serious threat requires our country to modernize and update our response to drug trafficking. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.

Accordingly, I hereby order:
