##### Deferred compensation plan.

The term "deferred compensation plan" means

(1) Any plan, contract, agreement, or other arrangement under which an employee voluntarily elects to defer all or a portion of the reasonable compensation, wages, or fees paid for services rendered which otherwise would have been paid to the employee at the time the services were rendered (including a plan that provides for the crediting of a reasonable investment return on such elective deferrals), provided that the TARP recipient either:

(i) Recognizes a compensation expense and accrues a liability for the benefit payments according to GAAP; or

(ii) Segregates or otherwise sets aside assets in a trust which may only be used to pay plan and other benefits, except that the assets of this trust may be available to satisfy claims of the TARP recipient's creditors in the case of insolvency; or

(2) A nonqualified deferred compensation or supplemental retirement plan, other than an elective deferral plan established by a TARP recipient:

(i) Primarily for the purpose of providing benefits for a select group of directors, management, or highly compensated employees in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by sections 415, 401(a)(17), 402(g) or any other applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 415, 401(a)(17), 402(g)); or

(ii) Primarily for the purpose for providing supplemental retirement benefits or other deferred compensation for a select group of directors, management or highly compensated employees (excluding severance payments).
