####### ยง 356.14 What are the requirements for submitting bids for customers?
######## Identifying customers.

(c)Submitters must provide the names of customers whenever they submit bids for them. Submitters must provide the names of their direct customers as well as customers of any intermediaries who are forwarding customer bids. For individuals, submitters must provide the customer's full name (first and last). For institutional customers, submitters must provide the name of the institution, and the bidder identification number if the customer provides it. For trusts or other fiduciary estates (See appendix A.), submitters must provide on the customer list:

(1) The full name or title of the trustee or fiduciary;

(2) A reference to the document creating the trust or fiduciary estate with date of execution; and

(3) The employer identification number (not social security number) of the trust or fiduciary estate. We do not consider trusts to be a separate bidder that have not been assigned, or that do not provide, an employer identification number.
