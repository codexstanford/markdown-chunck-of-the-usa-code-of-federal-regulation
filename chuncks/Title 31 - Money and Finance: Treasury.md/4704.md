######## Interest.

(1)The interest for the entire period the bond was outstanding shall be recalculated if the original interest rate at which the bond was issued is higher than an adjusted interest rate reflecting both the shorter period during which the bond was actually outstanding and a penalty. The adjusted interest rate is the Treasury rate which would have been in effect on the date of issue for a marketable Treasury bond maturing on the semi-annual maturity period before redemption reduced by a penalty which must be the lesser of:

(i) One-eighth of one percent times the number of months from the date of issuance to original maturity, divided by the number of full months elapsed from the date of issue to redemption; or

(ii) One-fourth of one percent.
