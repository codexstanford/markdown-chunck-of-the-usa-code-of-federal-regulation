(vii) The following "business identifier information" for the immediate, intermediate, and ultimate parents of the foreign person engaged in the transaction, including their main offices and branches:

(A) Business name, including all names under which the business is known to be or has been doing business;

(B) Business address;

(C) Business phone number, website address, and email address; and

(D) Employer identification number or other domestic tax or corporate identification number.

(d)(1) The voluntary notice shall list any filings with, or reports to, agencies of the U.S. Government that have been or will be made with respect to the transaction prior to its completion, indicating the agencies concerned, the nature of the filing or report, the date on which it was filed or the estimated date by which it will be filed, and a relevant contact point and/or telephone number within the agency, if known.

(2) Example: Corporation A, a foreign person, intends to acquire Corporation X, which is wholly owned and controlled by a U.S. national and which has a Facility Security Clearance under the Department of Defense Industrial Security Program. See Department of Defense, "Industrial Security Regulation," DOD 5220.22-R, and "Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information," DOD 5220.22-M. Corporation X accordingly files a revised Form DD SF-328, and enters into discussions with the Defense Security Service about effectively insulating its facilities from the foreign person. Corporation X may also have made filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, or other federal departments and agencies. This paragraph (d) requires that certain specific information about these filings be reported to the Committee in a voluntary notice.

(e) In the case of the establishment of a joint venture in which one or more of the parties is contributing a U.S. business, information for the voluntary notice shall be prepared on the assumption that the foreign person that is party to the joint venture has made an acquisition of the existing U.S. business that the other party to the joint venture is contributing or transferring to the joint venture. The voluntary notice shall describe the name and address of the joint venture and the entities that established, or are establishing, the joint venture.

(f) In the case of the acquisition of some but not all of the assets of an entity, paragraph (c) of this section requires submission of the specified information only with respect to the assets of the entity that have been or are proposed to be acquired.

Separate reports are not required for any entity whose financial results are included within the consolidated financial results stated in the annual report of any parent of any such entity, unless the transaction involves the acquisition of a U.S. business whose parent is not being acquired, in which case the notice shall include the most recent audited financial statement of the U.S. business that is the subject of the transaction. If a U.S. business does not prepare an annual report and its financial results are not included within the consolidated financial results stated in the annual report of a parent, the filing shall include, if available, the entity's most recent audited financial statement (or, if an audited financial statement is not available, the unaudited financial statement).

(h) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall, during the time that the matter is pending before the Committee or the President, promptly advise the Staff Chairperson of any material changes in plans, facts and circumstances addressed in the notice, and information provided or required to be provided to the Committee under this section, and shall file amendments to the notice to reflect such material changes. Such amendments shall become part of the notice filed by such persons under ยง 800.501, and the certifications required under paragraphs (l) and (m) of this section shall apply to such amendments.

(i) The immediate parent, the ultimate parent, and each intermediate parent, if any, of each foreign person that is a party to the transaction;

(ii) Where the ultimate parent is a private company, the ultimate owner(s) of such parent;

(iii) Where the ultimate parent is a public company, any shareholder with an interest of greater than five percent in such parent; and

(iv) The U.S. business that is the subject of the transaction, both before and after completion of the transaction; and

(2) The opinion of the person regarding whether:

(i) It is a foreign person;

(ii) It is controlled by a foreign government;

(iii) A foreign government holds a substantial interest in the foreign person that is party to the transaction; and

(iv) The transaction has resulted or could result in a covered control transaction or a covered investment, and the reasons for its view, focusing in particular on any powers (for example, by virtue of a shareholders agreement, contract, statute, or regulation) that the foreign person will have with regard to the U.S. business, and how those powers can or will be exercised, or any other access, rights, or involvement the foreign person will have in a U.S. business with respect to critical technologies, covered investment critical infrastructure, or sensitive personal data.

(k) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall include information as to whether:

(1) Any party to the transaction is, or has been, a party to a mitigation agreement entered into or condition imposed under section 721, and if so, shall specify the date and purpose of such agreement or condition and the U.S. Government signatories; and

(2) Any party to the transaction (including such party's parents, subsidiaries, or entities under common control with the party) has been a party to a transaction previously notified to the Committee.

(m) At the conclusion of a review or investigation, each party that has filed additional information subsequent to the original notice shall file a final certification. (See ยง 800.204.) A sample certification may be found at the Committee's section of the Department of the Treasury website.

(n) Parties filing a voluntary notice shall include with the notice a list identifying each document provided as part of the notice, including all documents provided as attachments or exhibits to the narrative response.

(o) A party filing a voluntary notice may stipulate that the transaction is a covered transaction and, if the party stipulates that the transaction is a covered transaction, that the transaction is a foreign government-controlled transaction. A stipulation offered by any party under this section must be accompanied by a detailed description of the basis for the stipulation. The required description of the basis shall include discussion of all relevant information responsive to paragraphs (c)(5)(iii) through (v) of this section. A party that offers such a stipulation acknowledges that the Committee and the President are entitled to rely on such stipulation in determining whether the transaction is a covered transaction, a foreign government-controlled transaction, and/or subject to mandatory declaration or notice for the purposes of section 721 and all authorities thereunder, and waives the right to challenge any such determination. Neither the Committee nor the President is bound by any such stipulation, nor does any such stipulation limit the ability of the Committee or the President to act on any authority provided under section 721 with respect to any covered transaction.
