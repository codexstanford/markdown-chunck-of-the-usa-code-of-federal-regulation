(a) "We are an authorized agent for payment of U.S. Savings Bonds and U.S. Savings Notes (Freedom Shares)."

(b) "This (bank/savings and loan association/credit union, etc.) is authorized to pay U.S. Savings Bonds and U.S. Savings Notes (Freedom Shares) and process eligible Series E and EE bonds and savings notes in exchange for Series HH bonds."
