###### Fees.

(i)The fee for costs required of the IRS in copying records pursuant to this paragraph is $0.15 per page. However, no fee will be charged if the aggregate costs required of the IRS in copying records is less than $3.00. If an individual who has requested access to inspect a record in person is denied such access by the designated official because it would not be feasible in a particular case, copies of such record will be furnished to the individual without payment of the fees otherwise required under this paragraph. If the IRS estimates that the total fees for costs incurred in complying with a request for copies of records will amount to $50 or more, the individual making the request may be required to enter into a contract for the payment of the actual fees with respect to the request before the Service will furnish the copies requested. Payment of fees for copies of records should be made by check or money order payable to the Internal Revenue Service.
