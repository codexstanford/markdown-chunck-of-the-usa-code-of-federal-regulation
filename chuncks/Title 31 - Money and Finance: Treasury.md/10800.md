####### Example 5.

(5)Corporation A, a foreign person, enters into a stock purchase agreement with Person Z to acquire 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. The value of the consideration has not been determined because it will be payable only once Corporation B achieves certain development and sales milestones, and it will be 10 percent of Corporation B's revenue over a future five-year period. The parties estimate in good faith that the fair market value of 100 percent of the shares of Corporation B is $30,000,000 based on a number of factors, including application of well-known accounting standards such as Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 157, a recent valuation conducted by a third-party auditor, and a proposal to acquire Corporation B made by another bidder for approximately $30,000,000 in cash. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $30,000,000, and the filing fee is $7,500.
