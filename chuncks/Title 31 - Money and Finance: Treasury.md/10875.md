(d) Irrespective of whether the foreign person satisfies the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) or (2), (a)(3)(i) through (iii), or (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section as of the completion date, if at any time during the three-year period following the completion date the foreign person no longer meets all the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (2), (a)(3)(i) through (iii), or (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the foreign person is not an excepted real estate investor with respect to the transaction from the completion date onward. This paragraph does not apply when an excepted real estate investor no longer meets any of the criteria solely due to a rescission of a determination under ยง 802.1001(b) or if the relevant foreign state otherwise ceases to be an excepted real estate foreign state.

(e) A foreign person may waive its status as an excepted real estate investor with respect to a transaction at any time by submitting a declaration under ยง 802.401 or filing a notice under ยง 802.501 regarding the transaction in which it explicitly waives such status. In such case, the foreign person will be deemed not to be an excepted real estate investor with respect to the transaction, and the relevant provisions of subpart D or E will apply.
