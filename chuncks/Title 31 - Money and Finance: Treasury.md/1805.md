#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Bonus.

The term "bonus" means any payment in addition to any amount payable to an employee for services performed by the employee at a regular hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or similar periodic rate. Such term generally does not include payments to or on behalf of an employee as contributions to any qualified retirement plan (as defined in section 4974(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 4974(c)), benefits under a broad-based benefit plan, bona fide overtime pay, or bona fide and routine expense reimbursements. In addition, provided that the rate of commission is pre-established and reasonable, and is applied consistently to the sale of substantially similar goods or services, commission compensation will not be treated as a bonus. For this purpose, a bonus may include a contribution to, or other increase in benefits under, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, regardless of when the actual payment will be made under the plan. A bonus may also qualify as a retention award or as incentive compensation.
