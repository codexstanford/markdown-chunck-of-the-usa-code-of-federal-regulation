### PART 30 - TARP STANDARDS FOR COMPENSATION AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
#### ยง 30.1 Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
##### Application to new entities.

(2)For an entity that is created or organized in the same year that the entity becomes a TARP recipient, a most highly compensated employee for the first year includes the person that the TARP recipient determines will be the most highly compensated employee for the next year based upon a reasonable, good faith determination of the projected annual compensation of such person earned during that year. This determination must be made as of the later of the date the entity is created or organized or the date the entity becomes a TARP recipient, and must be made only once. However, a person need not yet be an employee to be treated as a most highly compensated employee, if it is reasonably anticipated that the person will become an employee of the TARP recipient during the first year.
