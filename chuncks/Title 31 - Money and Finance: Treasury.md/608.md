###### Failure to deny or answer allegations in the complaint.

(c)Every allegation in the complaint which is not denied in the answer is deemed to be admitted and may be considered as proven, and no further evidence in respect of that allegation need be adduced at a hearing. Failure to file an answer within the time prescribed in the notice to the respondent, except as the time for answer is extended by the Director of Practice or the Administrative Law Judge, will constitute an admission of the allegations of the complaint and a waiver of hearing, and the Administrative Law Judge may make a decision by default without a hearing or further procedure.
