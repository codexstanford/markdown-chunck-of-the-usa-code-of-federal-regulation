####### Computation of purchase prices and discount amounts based on price per $100, for Treasury bills of all maturities:

B.

1. To determine the purchase price of any bill, divide the par amount by 100 and multiply the resulting quotient by the price per $100.

To compute the purchase price of a $10,000 13-week bill sold at a price of $98.098000 per $100, divide the par amount ($10,000) by 100 to obtain the multiple (100). That multiple times 98.098000 results in a purchase price of $9,809.80.

2. To determine the discount amount for any bill, subtract the purchase price from the par amount of the bill.

For a $10,000 bill with a purchase price of $9,809.80, the discount amount would be $190.20, or $10,000 - $9,809.80.
