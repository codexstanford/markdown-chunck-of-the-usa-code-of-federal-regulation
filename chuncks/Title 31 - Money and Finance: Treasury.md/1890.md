#### ยง 30.10 Q-10: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with section 111(b)(3)(D) of EESA (the limitations on bonus payments)?
##### Legally binding right under valid employment contracts,General rule.,see

(2)-(i)The prohibition under paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to bonus payments required to be paid under a valid employment contract if the employee had a legally binding right under the contract to a bonus payment as of February 11, 2009. For purposes of determining whether an employee had a legally binding right to a bonus payment,26 CFR 1.409A-1(b)(i). In addition, the bonus payment must be made in accordance with the terms of the contract as of February 11, 2009 (which may include application of an elective deferral election under a qualified retirement plan or a nonqualified deferred compensation plan), such that any subsequent amendment to the contract to increase the amount payable, accelerate any vesting conditions, or otherwise materially enhance the benefit available to the employee under the contract will result in the bonus payment being treated as not made under the employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009. However, amendment of a valid employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009 under which an employee has a legally binding right to a bonus payment to reduce the amount of the bonus payment or to enhance or include service-based or performance-based vesting requirements or holding period requirements will not result in this treatment. The amended employment contract would still be deemed a valid employment contract and the employee would still be treated as having a legally binding right to the bonus payment under the original employment contract. The TARP recipient and the employees of the TARP recipient should be cognizant of the restrictions under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 409A) in the case of an amendment described in the preceding sentence.
