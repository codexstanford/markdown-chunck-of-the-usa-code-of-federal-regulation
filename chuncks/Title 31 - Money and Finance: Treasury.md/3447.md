####### ยง 240.13 Indorsement by payees.
######## Indorsement of checks by a financial institution under the payee's authorization.

(3)When a check is credited by a financial institution to the payee's account under the payee's authorization, the financial institution may use an indorsement substantially as follows: "Credit to the account of the within-named payee in accordance with the payee's instructions. XYZ [Name of financial institution]." A financial institution using this form of indorsement will be deemed to guarantee to all subsequent indorsers and to the Treasury that it is acting as an attorney-in-fact for the payee, under the payee's authorization, and that this authority is currently in force and has neither lapsed nor been revoked either in fact or by the death or incapacity of the payee.
