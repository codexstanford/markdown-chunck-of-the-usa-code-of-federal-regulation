() The futures commission merchant's or introducing broker's non-documentary procedures must address situations where an individual is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document that bears a photograph or similar safeguard; the futures commission merchant or introducing broker is not familiar with the documents presented; the account is opened without obtaining documents; the customer opens the account without appearing in person at the futures commission merchant or introducing broker; and where the futures commission merchant or introducing broker is otherwise presented with circumstances that increase the risk that the futures commission merchant or introducing broker will be unable to verify the true identity of a customer through documents.
