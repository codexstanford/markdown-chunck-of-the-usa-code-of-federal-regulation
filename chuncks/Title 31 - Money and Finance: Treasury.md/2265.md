###### Excessive or luxury expenditures policy

means written standards applicable to the ECIP recipient and its employees that address the five categories of expenses set forth in the definition of "excessive or luxury expenditures," and that are reasonably designed to eliminate excessive and luxury expenditures. Such written standards must:

(1) Identify the types or categories of expenditures which are prohibited (which may include a threshold expenditure amount per item, activity, or event or a threshold expenditure amount per employee receiving the item or participating in the activity or event);

(2) Identify the types or categories of expenditures for which prior approval is required (which may include a threshold expenditure amount per item, activity, or event or a threshold expenditure amount per employee receiving the item or participating in the activity or event);

(3) Provide reasonable approval procedures for expenditures requiring prior approval;

(4) Require the ECIP recipient to deliver a certification, executed by two senior executive officers (one of which must be its principal executive officer or principal financial officer) certifying that the approval of any expenditure requiring the prior approval of any senior executive officer, any executive officer of a substantially similar level of responsibility, or the ECIP recipient's board of directors (or a committee of such board of directors), was properly obtained with respect to each such expenditure;

(5) Require the prompt internal reporting of violations to an appropriate person or persons identified in this policy; and

(6) Mandate accountability for adherence to the policy.
