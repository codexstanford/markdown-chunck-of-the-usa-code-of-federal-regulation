####### ยง 363.40 How are payments of principal and interest made?
######## Payments of interest and principal (except a savings bond that has reached final maturity).

(b)(1) We provide two methods of receiving payments of principal and interest:

(i) Payment to your account at a financial institution by the ACH method, or

(ii) Payment to your TreasuryDirect account to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness.

(2) You may select different payment destinations for principal and interest for a marketable Treasury security. You may change your payment destination at any time, unless the security is in the closed book period. (See ยง 363.210.)

(3) If we are unable to deliver a payment, we will use the payment to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness in your TreasuryDirect account.
