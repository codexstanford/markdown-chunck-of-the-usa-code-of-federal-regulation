#### Subpart C - Procedures for Offset of Treasury Department Payments To Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies
##### ยง 5.20 How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by a Treasury entity?
###### Offset of Treasury entity payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.

(a)(1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by Treasury entities and other Federal agencies, a process known as "centralized offset." When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask a Treasury entity (when acting as a "payment agency") to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Treasury entity, including salary payments issued to Treasury entity employees. This section and ยง 5.21 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks a Treasury entity to offset a payment issued by the Treasury entity to a person who owes a debt to the United States.
