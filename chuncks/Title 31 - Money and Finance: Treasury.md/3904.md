(b)The transfer books are closed for one full month preceding interest payment dates and call or maturity dates. If the date set for closing of the transfer books falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the books will be closed as of the close of business on the last business day preceding that date.

(1) Payment of final interest will be made to the registered owner of record on the date the books were closed.

(2) Payment of principal will be made to the assignee under a proper assignment of the securities.
