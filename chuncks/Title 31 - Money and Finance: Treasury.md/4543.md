No judicial determinations will be recognized which would give effect to an attempted voluntary transfer inter vivos of a Retirement Plan Bond. Otherwise, a claim against a registered owner will be recognized when established by valid judicial proceedings, but in no case will payment be made to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized to levy upon the property of the owner under appropriate process to satisfy a money judgement unless or until the bond has become eligible for redemption pursuant to the regulations in this part. Neither the Treasury Department nor any of its agencies will accept notices of adverse claims or of pending judicial proceedings or undertake to protect the interests of litigants who do not have possession of the bond.
