###### Granting of access.

(f)Normally, an individual will be granted access to inspect a record in person within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt for a request for notification and access by the designated official. If access cannot be granted within 30 days, the notification will state the reasons for the delay and the approximate time such access will be granted. An individual wishing to inspect a record may be accompanied by another person of his choosing. Both the individual seeking access and the individual accompanying him may be required to sign a form supplied by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicating that the Service is authorized to disclose or discuss the contents of the record in the presence of both individuals. See 26 CFR 601.502 for requirements to be met by taxpayer's representatives in order to discuss the contents of any tax records.
