###### Egregious case.

1.In those cases in which a civil monetary penalty is deemed appropriate, OFAC will make a determination as to whether a case is deemed "egregious" for purposes of the base penalty calculation. This determination will be based on an analysis of the applicable General Factors. In making the egregiousness determination, OFAC generally will give substantial weight to General Factors A ("willful or reckless violation of law"), B ("awareness of conduct at issue"), C ("harm to sanctions program objectives") and D ("individual characteristics"), with particular emphasis on General Factors A and B. A case will be considered an "egregious case" where the analysis of the applicable General Factors, with a focus on those General Factors identified above, indicates that the case represents a particularly serious violation of the law calling for a strong enforcement response. A determination that a case is "egregious" will be made by the Director or Deputy Director.
