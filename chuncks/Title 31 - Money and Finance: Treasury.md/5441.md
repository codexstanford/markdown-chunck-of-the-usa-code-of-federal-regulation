####### Daily Interest Decimal.

2.We compute a daily interest decimal in cases where an interest payment period for a non-indexed security is shorter or longer than six months or where accrued interest is payable by an investor. We base the daily interest decimal on the actual number of calendar days in the half-year or half-years involved. The number of days in any half-year period is shown in Table 1.

Table 2 below shows the daily interest decimals covering interest from% to 20% on $1,000 for one day in increments ofof one percent. These decimals represent,,, orof a full semiannual interest payment, depending on which half-year is applicable.
