###### Judicial review.

(k)If, after a review and final determination on a request to amend a record by the appropriate reviewing officer, the individual is notified that the request will not be granted, or if, after the expiration of 30 days (not including Sundays, Saturdays, and legal public holidays) from the receipt of such request by the Director, Disclosure Operations Division, action is not taken thereon in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section, an individual may commence an action within the time prescribed by law in a U.S. District Court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1). The statute authorizes an action only against the agency. With respect to records maintained by the IRS, the agency is the Internal Revenue Service, not an officer or employee thereof. Service of process in such an action shall be in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.) applicable to actions against an agency of the United States. Where provided in such Rules, delivery of process upon the IRS must be directed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: CC:GLS, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20224. The district court will determine the matter de novo.
