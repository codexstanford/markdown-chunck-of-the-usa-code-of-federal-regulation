###### Appendix A to Part 356 - Bidder Categories
####### Corporation

(a)-We consider a corporation to be one bidder. A corporation includes all of its affiliates, which may be persons, partnerships, or other entities. We consider a business trust, such as a Massachusetts or Delaware business trust, to be a corporation. We use the term "corporate structure" to refer to the collection of affiliates that we consider collectively to be one bidder. An affiliate is any:

- Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation;

- Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by any other affiliate of the corporation;

- Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the corporation;

- Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of any other affiliate of the corporation; or

- Entity, a majority of whose board of directors or a majority of whose general partners are directors or officers of the corporation, or of any affiliate of the corporation.

An entity that is more than 50-percent owned as described in this definition is not an affiliate, however, if:

- The purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity;

- The owner does not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;

- The owner does not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;

- The corporation has written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent it from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and

- The corporation submits notice and certification to us, as provided in this appendix A.

A corporation that plans to make use of this exception to the definition of "affiliate" must inform us of this fact in writing and provide the following certification:

[Name of corporation] hereby certifies that, with regard to any entity of which it owns more than 50 percent as defined in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356, but for which the purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity:

- We do not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;

- We do not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;

- We have written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the corporation from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and

- We will continue to meet the terms of this certification until we notify the Treasury of a change.
