###### Material changes in policies or procedures.

(d)An ECIP recipient must obtain prior approval from the Department of the Treasury before making any material change to the policies or procedures that it maintains for purposes of compliance with paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section. A change to the compensation, severance pay, or excessive or luxury expenditures policies or procedures will be considered material for purposes of this section if the change is likely to have a negative effect on the financial condition of the ECIP recipient, limit the ability of the ECIP recipient to make payments under the terms of an ECIP instrument, or otherwise impair the ECIP recipient's ability to meet its obligations to the Department of the Treasury under the ECIP.

(1) A request to make a material change to compensation, severance pay or excessive luxury expenditures policies or procedures, must be submitted by an ECIP recipient in writing and received by the Department of the Treasury at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the policy change. The request should describe the change, reason for the change, and anticipated financial or other impact of the change on the condition of the ECIP recipient.

(2) The request will be deemed approved thirty days after the ECIP recipient has provided a complete request to the Department of the Treasury, unless, prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period, the Department of the Treasury objects to the proposed change or notifies the ECIP recipient that additional time is required in order to complete review of the proposed change to policy or procedures
