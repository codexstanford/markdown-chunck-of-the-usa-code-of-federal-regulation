##### Gross-up.

The term "gross-up" means any reimbursement of taxes owed with respect to any compensation, provided that a gross-up does not include a payment under a tax equalization agreement, which is an agreement, method, program, or other arrangement that provides payments intended to compensate an employee for some or all of the excess of the taxes actually imposed by a foreign jurisdiction on the compensation paid by the TARP recipient to the employee over the taxes that would be imposed if the compensation were subject solely to U.S. Federal, State, and local income tax, or some or all of the excess of the U.S. Federal, State, and local income tax actually imposed on the compensation paid by the TARP recipient to the employee over the taxes that would be imposed if the compensation were subject solely to taxes in the applicable foreign jurisdiction, provided that the payment made under such agreement, method, program, or other arrangement may not exceed such excess and the amount necessary to compensate for the additional taxes on the amount paid under the agreement, method, program, or other arrangement.
