####### ยง 356.15 What rules apply to bids submitted by investment advisers?
######## General.

(a)The auction rules that apply to investment advisers are determined by the relationship between "investment advisers" and "controlled accounts." An investment adviser means any person or entity that has investment discretion for the bids or positions of a different person or entity (a controlled account). A person or entity has investment discretion if it determines what, how many, and when securities will be purchased or sold on behalf of another person or entity. We consider a person that is employed or supervised by an investment adviser to be part of that investment adviser. We also consider the bids or positions of controlled accounts to be separate from the bids or positions of the person or entity with which they would otherwise be associated under the bidder categories in appendix A of this part.
