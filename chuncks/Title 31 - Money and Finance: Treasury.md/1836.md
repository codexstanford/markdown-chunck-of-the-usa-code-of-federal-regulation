##### Most highly compensated employee.,In general.

(1)The terms "most highly compensated employee" or "most highly compensated employees" mean the employee or employees of the TARP recipient whose annual compensation is determined to be the highest among all employees of the TARP recipient, provided that, solely for purposes of identifying the employees who are subject to any rule applicable to both the SEOs and one or more of the most highly compensated employees of the TARP recipient, SEOs of the TARP recipient are excluded when identifying the most highly compensated employee(s). For this purpose, a former employee who is no longer employed as of the first date of the relevant fiscal year of the TARP recipient is not a most highly compensated employee unless it is reasonably anticipated that such employee will return to employment with the TARP recipient during such fiscal year.
