## Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Money and Finance

##### Appendix A to Part 550 - Executive Order 14046 of September 17, 2021
###### Sec. 8.

For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked or affected by this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds and other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
