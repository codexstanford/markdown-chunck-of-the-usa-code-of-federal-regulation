(1)The term "incentive plan" means an "incentive plan" as that term is defined in Item 402(a)(6)(iii) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)(6)(iii)), and any plan providing stock or options as defined in Item 402(a)(6)(i) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)(6)(i)) or other equity-based compensation such as restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights, except for the payment of salary or other permissible payments in stock, stock units, or other property as described in paragraph (2) of this definition. An incentive plan does not include the payment of salary, but does include an arrangement under which an employee would earn compensation in the nature of a commission, unless such compensation qualifies as commission compensation (as defined above). Accordingly, an incentive plan includes an arrangement under which an employee receives compensation only upon the completion of a specified transaction, such as an initial public offering or sale or acquisition of a specified entity or entities, regardless of how such compensation is measured. For examples,the definition of "commission compensation," above. An incentive plan, or a grant under an incentive plan, may also qualify as a bonus or a retention award.
