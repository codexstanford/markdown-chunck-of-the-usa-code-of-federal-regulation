###### ยง 800.1103 Valuation.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the value of the transaction for purposes of determining the required fee amount in this subpart means the total value of all consideration that has been or will be provided in the context of the transaction by or on behalf of the foreign person that is a party to the transaction, including cash, assets, shares or other ownership interests, debt forgiveness, or services or other in-kind consideration.

(b) Determining the value of consideration:

(1) Where the consideration is or includes securities traded on a national securities exchange, the value of the securities is the closing price on the national securities exchange on which the securities are primarily traded on the trading day immediately prior to the date the parties file the formal written notice with the Committee under ยง 800.501(a), or if the securities were not traded on that day, the last published closing price.

(2) Where the consideration is or includes other non-cash assets, services, interests, or other in-kind consideration, the value of the assets, services, interests, or other in-kind consideration is their fair market value as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

(3) Where the transaction is or includes a lending transaction, the consideration includes the cash value of the loan, or similar financing arrangement, made available or provided by or on behalf of the foreign person that is a party to the transaction.

(4) Where the transaction is or includes the conversion of a contingent equity interest previously acquired by a foreign person that is a party to the transaction, the consideration includes what was paid by or on behalf of the foreign person to initially acquire the contingent equity interest, in addition to any other consideration paid or to be paid in connection with the conversion.

(c) Exceptions:

(1) To the extent the consideration to be provided by the foreign person has not been or cannot reasonably be determined as of the date the parties file the notice, the value of the transaction includes, with respect to the interest for which consideration has not been determined, the fair market value of the interest being acquired in the transaction as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

(2) Where the transaction involves a merger or the contribution of one or more U.S. businesses to a joint venture, the value of the transaction is the fair market value of the U.S. business(es) being merged or contributed.

(3) Where the value of a transaction is $5,000,000 or more, but the transaction includes one or more non-U.S. businesses, and the value of the interest acquired in the U.S. business is less than $5,000,000, the filing fee under ยง 800.1101(b) is applicable. The value of the U.S. business, for purposes of this paragraph, is the fair market value of the assets of the U.S. business.

(d) Fair market value means the price that would be received in exchange for sale of an interest, or paid to receive a service or to transfer liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants.

(1) In determining fair market value, parties shall make a good faith estimate and generally may rely on the last valuation as presented in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or other widely recognized accounting principles, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards, or the valuation of an independent appraiser; provided, however, that if no valuation has occurred within the prior two fiscal quarters, or if there have been significant changes to the fair market value since the last valuation, the parties shall make a good faith estimate at the time of filing the formal written notice, or, if the parties are filing after the completion of the transaction, the completion date of the transaction.

(2) In determining the fair market value of services, the parties may rely upon the value of services determined by the parties as set forth in an executed written agreement, or make an estimate at the time of filing the formal written notice based upon rates charged to third parties or upon recent industry reports or other sources of comparable commercial data; provided, however, if such sources are unavailable, the parties shall make a good faith estimate. If the parties are filing after completion of the transaction, the parties shall make an estimate of the fair market value as of the completion date.

(3) The Staff Chairperson is not bound by the parties' characterization of the transaction and its value or the parties' good faith approximation provided to the Committee under ยง 800.502(c)(1)(viii).

(e) Multiple-phase and contingent equity interest transactions:

(1) Where a transaction will be effectuated in multiple phases, the value of the transaction includes the total value of the multiple phases, as may be reasonably determined as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

(2) Where a transaction is or includes the acquisition of contingent equity interest, the value of the transaction includes the consideration that was paid by or on behalf of the foreign person to acquire the contingent equity interest, and, if the conditions that lead to conversion will occur imminently, the conditions are within the control of the acquiring party, and the consideration for the interest that would be acquired upon conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions can be reasonably determined at the time of acquisition, any other consideration paid or to be paid in connection with the conversion.

(f) Examples:
