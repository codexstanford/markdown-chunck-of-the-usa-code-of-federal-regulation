####### Standards for issuance.

(b)If it appears to the Administrative Law Judge that a subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the Administrative Law Judge determines that the subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue a modified subpoena as fairness requires. In making the foregoing determination, the Administrative Law Judge may inquire of the other participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be proved.
