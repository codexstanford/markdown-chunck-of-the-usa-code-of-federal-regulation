######## ยง 351.16 What do I need to know about the base denomination for redemption value calculations?

We base all calculations of interest on a unit with a principal amount of $12.50. We use this unit value to determine the value of bonds in higher denominations. The effect of rounding off the value of the $12.50 unit increases at higher denominations. This can work to your slight advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether the value is rounded up or down.
