####### ยง 363.205 How do I reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held in TreasuryDirect &#xAE;?
######## Method for reinvesting a maturing security.

(a)The only method of reinvesting a maturing marketable security in TreasuryDirect &#xAE; is through the automatic reinvestment option available in your TreasuryDirect account. Purchasing a security by directing that the proceeds of a maturing security be used to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness, and then scheduling the purchase of a new security using the redemption proceeds of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness, is not a reinvestment.
