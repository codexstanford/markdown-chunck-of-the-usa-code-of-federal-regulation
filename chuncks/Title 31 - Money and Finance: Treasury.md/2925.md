(a) A Treasury-State agreement documents the accepted funding techniques and methods for calculating interest agreed upon by us and a State and identifies the Federal assistance programs governed by this subpart A. If anything in a Treasury-State agreement is inconsistent with this subpart A, that part of the Treasury-State agreement will not have any effect and this subpart A will govern.
