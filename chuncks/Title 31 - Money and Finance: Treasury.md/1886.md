### PART 30 - TARP STANDARDS FOR COMPENSATION AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
#### ยง 30.10 Q-10: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with section 111(b)(3)(D) of EESA (the limitations on bonus payments)?
##### Multi-year service periods.

(3)Certain bonus payments may relate to a multi-year service period, during some portion of which the employee is a SEO or most highly compensated employee subject to paragraph (a) of this section, and during some portion of which the employee is not. In these circumstances, the employee will not be treated as having accrued the bonus payment during the period the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee if the bonus payment is at least reduced to reflect the portion of the service period that the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee. If the employee is a SEO or most highly compensated employee at the time the net bonus payment amount after such reduction would otherwise be paid, the amount still may not be paid until such time as bonus payments to that employee are permitted.
