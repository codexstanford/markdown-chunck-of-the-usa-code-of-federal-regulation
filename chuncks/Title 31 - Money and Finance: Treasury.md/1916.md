#### ยง 30.16 Q-16: What is the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, and what are its powers, duties and responsibilities?
##### Other executive officers and most highly compensated employees.,see

(ii)With respect to any employee who is either an executive officer (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act Rule 3b-7) or one of the 100 most highly compensated employees of a TARP recipient receiving exceptional assistance (or both), who is not subject to the bonus limitations under ยง 30.10 (Q-10), the Special Master shall determine whether the compensation structure for such employees will or may result in payments that are inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or are otherwise contrary to the public interest. The Special Master shall make such determination through application of the principles outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. With respect to the scope of the required review, the Special Master shall determine only whether the compensation arrangements are adequately structured, and is not required to rule with respect to the amounts that are or may be payable thereunder. However, the TARP recipient may also request an advisory opinion with respect to the amounts that are or may be payable, which the Special Master may provide in his sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the total annual compensation to an employee complies with the rules applicable to an SEO under ยง 30.10 (Q-10) applied without any limits on the grant of long-term restricted stock, and the annual compensation other than long-term restricted stock does not exceed $500,000 (or for 2009, $500,000 prorated to reflect the remaining portion of 2009 after June 15, 2009), the compensation structure will automatically be deemed to meet the requirements and no prior approval by the Special Master will be required. For purposes of the $500,000 limit, in determining annual compensation, all equity-based compensation granted in fiscal years ending after June 15, 2009 will be included in the calculation only in the year in which they are granted at their total fair market value on the grant date and all equity-based compensation granted in fiscal years ending prior to June 15, 2009 will not be included in the calculation of annual compensation. In addition, solely for purposes of applying the limit (and not for purposes of identifying the most highly compensated employees), the term annual compensation includes amounts required to be disclosed under paragraph (viii) of Item 402(a) of Regulation S-K of the Federal securities laws (change in the actuarial present value of benefits under a pension plan and above-market earnings on deferred compensation). The Special Master's administration of these provisions may provide for limited or no review of a portion of a compensation structure by the Special Master depending on the amount of potential payments, the type of such payments, the overall compensation earned by the employee during the relevant period, a combination thereof, or such other factors as the Special Master determines, where the Special Master has determined that such factors demonstrate that such payments are not, or are highly unlikely to be, inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Initial requests for such approval must be submitted no later than 120 days after publication of the final rule. Separate requests need not be submitted for each individual covered employee, but should be submitted for identified groups of employees subject to the same compensation structures to the extent possible as long as sufficient detail regarding individual compensation awards are provided as necessary to evaluate such employee's compensation structure. The Special Master shall issue a determination within 60 days of the receipt of a substantially complete submission. The TARP recipient must make a further request for approval to the extent the compensation structure, including the amounts that are or may be payable, for any executive officer is materially amended. In reviewing compensation structures for any period subject to Special Master review, the Special Master may take into account other compensation structures and other compensation earned, accrued or paid, including such compensation and compensation structures that are not subject to the restrictions of Section 111 of EESA pursuant to section 111(b)(3)(D)(iii) (ยง 30.10(e)(2) (Q-30.10(e)(2) (certain legally binding rights under valid written employment contracts)), and amounts that were accrued or paid prior to June 15, 2009 and are therefore not subject to review by the Special Master.
