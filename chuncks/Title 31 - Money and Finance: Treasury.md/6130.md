######## ยง 363.54 What is the minimum amount of a book-entry savings bond that I must hold in my account?

Each bond held in your account must have a redemption value of at least $25. If you request a transaction that would reduce the remaining redemption value of the bond to an amount less than $25, we will not permit the transaction to occur.
