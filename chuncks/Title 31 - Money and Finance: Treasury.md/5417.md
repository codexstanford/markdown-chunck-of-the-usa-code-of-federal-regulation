####### ยง 356.31 How does the STRIPS program work?
######## Principal components.

(2)Principal components stripped from inflation-protected securities are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their par amount. At maturity, the holder will receive the inflation-adjusted principal or the par amount, whichever is greater. (See ยง 356.30.) A principal component has a CUSIP number that is different from the CUSIP number of the fully constituted (unstripped) security.
