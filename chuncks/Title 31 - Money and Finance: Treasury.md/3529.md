####### ยง 256.54 What happens if Fiscal Service denies a request for payment?

Fiscal Service must deny any request for payment that fails to satisfy the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 1304. The submitting agency may request reconsideration of a payment denial. The submitting agency must provide an explanation of how the request for payment meets the four tests contained in section 256.1 of this part. If applicable, requests for reconsideration must contain a reference to the agency's program authority and include specific funding provisions that pertain to the program activity that resulted in the claim. If, upon reconsideration, Fiscal Service determines that payment from the Judgment Fund is appropriate, and the agency has already made payment to the plaintiff or claimant, Fiscal Service will reimburse the agency from the Judgment Fund.
