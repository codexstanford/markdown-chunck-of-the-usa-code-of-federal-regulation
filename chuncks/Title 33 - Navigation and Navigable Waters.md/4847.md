######## Base loading

means a method of inerting, enriching, or diluting such that sufficient inerting, enriching, or diluting gas, for the worst concentration of vapor coming from the vessel, is injected into the vapor line during the entire loading operation so that the vapor mixture is inerted, enriched, or diluted at the maximum loading rate. For inerting and enriching systems, "worst concentration" means the vapor stream contains no cargo vapor. For a diluting system, "worst concentration" means the vapor stream is saturated with cargo vapor.
