######## Location.

(a)(1) The following area is a regulated navigation area (RNA): All waters offshore Cape Canaveral from surface to bottom, encompassed by a line connecting the following points beginning with Point 1 at 28&#xB0;48&#x2032;54&#x2033; N, 80&#xB0;28&#x2032;40&#x2033; W; thence southwest to Point 2 at 28&#xB0;43&#x2032;20&#x2033; N, 80&#xB0;41&#x2032;00&#x2033; W; thence south along the shoreline to Point 3 at 28&#xB0;25&#x2032;18&#x2033; N, 80&#xB0;34&#x2032;43&#x2033; W; thence continuing south offshore to Point 4 at 28&#xB0;11&#x2032;00&#x2033; N, 80&#xB0;29&#x2032;00&#x2033; W; thence east to Point 5 at 28&#xB0;10&#x2032;00&#x2033; N, 80&#xB0;21&#x2032;13&#x2033; W; thence north along the 12 nautical mile line back to Point 1. Coordinates are in World Geodetic System (WGS) 1984. These coordinates are based on the furthest north and south trajectories of typical rocket launch vehicles originating from Cape Canaveral.

(2) Restrictions may be enforced anywhere within the boundaries of the RNA. Restrictions will be based on the risk assessment of the Captain of the Port Jacksonville and informed by the mission specific launch exclusion areas provided by U.S. Space Launch Delta 45 (SLD 45). There are five launch hazard areas that cover rocket launches. Launch hazard areas include all navigable waters within the following coordinates, encompassed by a line starting at Point 1 connecting the following points:
