####### Training procedures.

(f)(1) This section of the response plan must address the training procedures and programs of the vessel owner or operator. The vessel owner or operator shall ensure that-

(i) All personnel with responsibilities under the plan receive training in their assignments and refresher training as necessary, and participate in exercises required under paragraph (g) of this section. Documented work experience can be used instead of training; and

(ii) Records of this training are maintained aboard the vessel, at the U.S. location of the spill management team, or with the qualified individual. The plan must specify where the records are located.

(2) Nothing in this section relieves the vessel owner or operator from responsibility to ensure that all private shore-based response personnel are trained to meet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for emergency response operations in 29 CFR 1910.120.
