### PART 336 - FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE EVALUATION OF ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS DREDGING PROJECTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF DREDGED MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE U.S. AND OCEAN WATERS
#### ยง 336.1 Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.
##### Scenic and recreational values.

(7)(i) Maintenance dredging and disposal activities may involve areas which possess recognized scenic, recreational, or similar values. Full evaluation requires that due consideration be given to the effect which dredging and disposal of the dredged or fill material may have on the enhancement, preservation, or development of such values. Recognition of these values is often reflected by state, regional, or local land use classification or by similar Federal controls or policies. Operations and maintenance activities should, insofar as possible, be consistent with and avoid adverse effects on the values or purposes for which such resources have been recognized or set aside, and for which those classifications, controls, or policies were established. Special consideration must be given to rivers named in section 3 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and those proposed for inclusion as provided by section 4 and 5 of the Act, or by later legislation.

(ii) Any other areas named in Acts of Congress or Presidential Proclamations, such as National Rivers, National Wilderness Areas, National Seashores, National Parks, and National Monuments, should be given full consideration when evaluating Corps operations and maintenance activities.
