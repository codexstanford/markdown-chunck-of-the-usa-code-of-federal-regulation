(l)The Dam Safety Act, Public Law 92-367, provides that dams constructed pursuant to licenses issued under the authority of the Federal Power Act are specifically exempted from the national inspection program administered by the Corps. However, the law further provides that the Secretary of the Army upon request of the FERC may inspect dams which have been licensed under the Federal Power Act. The Commission by letter dated August 29, 1972 informed the Corps that the Commission does not expect to request the Corps' assistance for inspecting the projects licensed under the Federal Power Act.
