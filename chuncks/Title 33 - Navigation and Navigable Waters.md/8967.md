#### ยง 207.160 All waterways tributary to the Atlantic Ocean south of Chesapeake Bay and all waterways tributary to the Gulf of Mexico east and south of St. Marks, Fla.; use, administration, and navigation.
##### Entrance to and exit from locks.

(4)No vessel or raft shall enter or leave the locks before being signalled to do so. While waiting their turns, vessels or rafts must not obstruct traffic and must remain at a safe distance from the lock. They shall take position in rear of any vessels or rafts that may precede them, and there arrange the tow for locking in sections if necessary. Masters and pilots of vessels or in charge of rafts shall cause no undue delay in entering or leaving the lock, and will be held to a strict accountability that the approaches are not at any time unnecessarily obstructed by parts of a tow awaiting lockage or already passed through. They shall provide sufficient men to move through the lock promptly without damage to the structures. Vessels or tows that fail to enter the locks with reasonable promptness after being signalled to do so will lose their turn.
