##### ยง 203.43 Inspection of Federal flood control works.
###### Required inspections.

(a)A completed Federal flood control project, or completed functional portions thereof, is granted Active status in the RIP upon transfer of the operation and maintenance of the project (or functional portion thereof) to the non-Federal sponsor. Federal flood control works will be periodically inspected in accordance with 33 CFR 208.10 and Engineer Regulation (ER) 1130-2-530, Flood Control Operations and Maintenance Policies. These periodic inspections of Federal flood control works are also, for simplicity, known as CEI's. If a Federal project is found to be inadequately maintained on a CEI, then it will be placed in an Inactive status in the RIP. [This is a separate and distinct action from project deauthorization, which is not within the scope of PL 84-99 activities.] A Federal project will remain in an Inactive status until such time as an adequate maintenance program is restored, and the project is determined by the Corps to be adequately maintained.
