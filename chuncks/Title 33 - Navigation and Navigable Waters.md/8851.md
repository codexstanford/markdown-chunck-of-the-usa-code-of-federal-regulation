(f)Occasionally weather phenomena occur which produce a much higher than normal probability or threat of flooding which may be predicted several months in advance of occurrence or significant impact. Impacts on specific locations may be unpredictable, but regional impacts may have a high likelihood of occurrence. In such situations, the Corps may provide technical and contingency planning assistance to tribal, State, and local agencies, commensurate with the predicted weather phenomenon, based on requests for assistance from such tribal, State, and local agencies. Specific Advance Measures projects must be addressed as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
