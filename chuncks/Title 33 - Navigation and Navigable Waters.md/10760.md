### PART 334 - DANGER ZONE AND RESTRICTED AREA REGULATIONS
#### ยง 334.778 Pensacola Bay and waters contiguous to the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL; restricted area.
##### The regulations.

(b)(1) All persons, vessels, and other craft are prohibited from entering the waters described in paragraph (a) of this section for any reason. All vessels and craft, including pleasure vessels and craft (sailing, motorized, and/or rowed or self-propelled), private and commercial fishing vessels, other commercial vessels, barges, and all other vessels and craft, except vessels owned or operated by the United States and/or a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency are restricted from transiting, anchoring, or drifting within the above described area, or within 500 feet of any quay, pier, wharf, or levee along the Naval Air Station Pensacola shoreline abutting, nor may such vessels or crafts or persons approach within 500 feet of any United States owned or operated vessel transiting, anchored, or moored within the waters described in paragraph (a) of this section. The Commanding Officer, Naval Air Station Pensacola, or his/her designee, or the Commanding Officer of a vessel of the United States operating within the said area, may grant special permission to a person, vessel, or craft to enter upon the waters subject to the restrictions aforementioned.

(2) The existing "Navy Channel" adjacent to the north shore of Magazine Point, by which vessels enter and egress Bayous Davenport and Grande into Pensacola Bay shall remain open to all craft except in those extraordinary circumstances where the Commanding Officer, N.A.S. or his/her designee determines that risk to the installation, its personnel, or property is so great and so imminent that closing the channel to all but designated military craft is required for security reasons, or as directed by higher authority. This section will not preclude the closure of the channel as part of a security exercise; however, such closures of said channel will be limited in duration and scope to the maximum extent so as not to interfere with the ability of private vessels to use the channel for navigation in public waters adjacent thereto not otherwise limited by this regulation.

(3) The regulations in this section shall be enforced by the Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, and such agencies he/she may designate.
