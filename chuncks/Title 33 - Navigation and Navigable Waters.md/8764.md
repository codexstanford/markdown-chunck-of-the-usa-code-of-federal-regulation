###### Flood Response.

(a)Requests for Corps assistance will be in writing from the appropriate requesting official, or his or her authorized representative. When time does not permit a written request, a verbal request from a responsible tribal, State, or local official will be accepted, followed by a written confirmation.

(1) Corps assistance may include operational control of flood response activities, if requested by the responsible tribal, State, or local official. However, legal responsibility always remains with the tribal, State, and local officials.

(2) Corps assistance will be terminated when the flood waters recede below bankfull, absent a short term threat (e.g., a significant storm front expected to arrive within a day or two) likely to cause additional flooding.

(3) Removal of ice jams is a local responsibility. Corps technical advice and assistance, as well as assistance with flood fight operations, can be provided to supplement State and local efforts. The Corps will not perform ice jam blasting operations for local interests.
