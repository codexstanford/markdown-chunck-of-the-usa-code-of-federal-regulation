(a)The Auxiliary facility decal is composed of two parts. The upper part is a conventional white shield with a medium blue (Coast Guard blue) Coast Guard Auxiliary emblem centered on a broad diagonal red (Coast Guard red) slash which is at a 70 degree angle, rising toward the viewer's right.

The entire design is centered on the shield. The lower part displays two laterally radiating wreath branches centered immediately beneath the shield. A broad diagonal red (Coast Guard red) slash, which is at a 70 degree angle, rising toward the viewer's right and followed, on the viewer's left, by two narrow, parallel stripes, first a white stripe and then a medium blue (Coast Guard blue) stripe, is displayed on the wreath's right-hand branch.
