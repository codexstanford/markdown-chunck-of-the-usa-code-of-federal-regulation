###### Repair and rehabilitation.

The term "repair and rehabilitation" means the repair or rebuilding of a flood control structure, after the structure has been damaged by a flood, hurricane, or coastal storm, to the level of protection provided by the structure prior to the flood, hurricane, or coastal storm. "Repair and rehabilitation" does not include improvements (betterments) to the structure, nor does "repair and rehabilitation" include any repair or rebuilding of a flood control structure that, in the normal course of usage, has become structurally unsound and is no longer fit to provide the level of protection for which it was designed.
