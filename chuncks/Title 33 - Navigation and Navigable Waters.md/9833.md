(f) The Federal Power Act of 1920 (16 U.S.C. 791a), as amended, authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency (FERC) to issue licenses for the construction and the operation and maintenance of dams, water conduits, reservoirs, power houses, transmission lines, and other physical structures of a hydro-power project. However, where such structures will affect the navigable capacity of any navigable water of the United States (as defined in 16 U.S.C. 796), the plans for the dam or other physical structures affecting navigation must be approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army. In such cases, the interests of navigation should normally be protected by a DA recommendation to FERC for the inclusion of appropriate provisions in the FERC license rather than the issuance of a separate DA permit under 33 U.S.C. 401As to any other activities in navigable waters not constituting construction and the operation and maintenance of physical structures licensed by FERC under the Federal Power Act of 1920, as amended, the provisions of 33 U.S.C. 401remain fully applicable. In all cases involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal in ocean waters, section 404 or section 103 will be applicable.
