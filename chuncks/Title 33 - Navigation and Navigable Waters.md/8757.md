###### Procurement/stockpiling.

(b)Procurement and stockpiling of sandbags, pumps, and/or other materials or equipment that might be needed during flood situations is a non-Federal responsibility. The Corps is normally a last resort option for obtaining such materials. Local interests should request such materials from State assets prior to seeking Corps assistance. Local interests are responsible for reimbursing (either in kind or in cash) the Corps for expendable flood fight supplies and materials, and returning items such as pumps. When a flood is of sufficient magnitude to receive a Stafford Act emergency or disaster declaration, then the District Engineer may waive reimbursement of expendable supplies.
