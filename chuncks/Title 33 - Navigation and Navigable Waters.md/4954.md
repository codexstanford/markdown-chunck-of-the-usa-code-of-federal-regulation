2.

2.1 This standard is intended for detonation flame arresters protecting systems containing vapors of flammable or combustible liquids where vapor temperatures do not exceed 60 &#xB0;C. For all tests, the test media defined in 14.1.1 can be used except where detonation flame arresters protect systems handling vapors with a maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) below 0.9 millimeters. Detonation flame arresters protecting such systems must be tested with appropriate media (the same vapor or a media having a MESG no greater than the vapor). Various gases and their respective MESG are listed in attachment 1.

2.2 The tests in this standard are intended to qualify detonation flame arresters for all in-line applications independent of piping configuration provided the operating pressure is equal to or less than the maximum operating pressure limit specified in the manufacturer's certification and the diameter of the piping system in which the detonation arrester is to be installed is equal to or less than the piping diameter used in the testing.
