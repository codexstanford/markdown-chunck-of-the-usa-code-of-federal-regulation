Each lantern shall show through one red and two green horizontal arcs of 60&#xB0; each, the axis of each green arc to be 90&#xB0; from the axis of the red arc; each light shall be securely mounted at the floor level of the span as near to the side of the span as practicable with the axis of the red light normal to the long axis of the swing span and so that the red light will be visible from an approaching vessel when the span is closed.
