####### Drills.

(b)(1) From the date of the FSP approval, the FSO must ensure that at least one security drill is conducted every 3 months. Security drills may be held in conjunction with non-security drills, where appropriate.

(2) Drills must test individual elements of the FSP, including response to security threats and incidents. Drills should take into account the types of operations of the OCS facility, OCS facility personnel changes, the types of vessels calling at the OCS facility, and other relevant circumstances. Examples of drills include unauthorized entry to a restricted area, response to alarms, and notification of appropriate authorities.

(3) If a vessel is conducting operations with the OCS facility on the date the OCS facility has planned to conduct any drills, the OCS facility may include, but cannot require, the vessel or vessel personnel to participate in the OCS facility's scheduled drill.
