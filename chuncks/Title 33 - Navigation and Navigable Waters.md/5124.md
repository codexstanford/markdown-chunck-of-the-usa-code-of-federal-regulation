####### General information and introduction.

(a)This section of the response plan must include-

(1) The vessel's name, country of registry, call sign, official number, and IMO international number (if applicable). If the plan covers multiple vessels, this information must be provided for each vessel;

(2) The name, address, and procedures for contacting the vessel's owner or operator on a 24-hour basis;

(3) A list of COTP zones in which the vessel intends to handle, store, or transport oil;

(4) A table of contents or index of sufficient detail to permit personnel with responsibilities under the response plan to locate the specific sections of the plan; and

(5) A record of change(s) page used to record information on plan updates or revisions.

(6) As required in paragraph (c) of this section, the vessel owner or operator must list in his or her plan the total volume of oil carried in bulk as cargo.

(i) For vessels that transfer a portion of their fuel as cargo, 25 percent of the fuel capacity of the vessel plus the capacity of any oil cargo tank(s) will be assumed to be the cargo volume for determining applicable response plan requirements unless the vessel owner or operator indicates otherwise.

(ii) A vessel owner or operator can use a volume less than 25 percent if he or she submits historical data with the plan that substantiates the transfer of a lower percentage of its fuel capacity between refuelings.
