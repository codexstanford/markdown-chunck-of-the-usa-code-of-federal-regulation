### PART 336 - FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE EVALUATION OF ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS DREDGING PROJECTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF DREDGED MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE U.S. AND OCEAN WATERS
#### ยง 336.1 Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.
##### Additional factors.

(11)In addition to the factors described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section, the following factors should also be considered.

(i) The evaluation of Corps operations and maintenance activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. is a continuing process and should proceed concurrently with the processing of state water quality certification and, if required, the provision of a coastal zone consistency determination to the state. If a local agency having jurisdiction over or concern with the particular activity comments on the project through the public notice coordination, due consideration should be given to those official views as a reflection of local factors.

(ii) Where officially adopted state, regional, or local land use classifications, determinations, or policies are applicable, they normally will be presumed to reflect local views and will be considered in addition to other national factors.
