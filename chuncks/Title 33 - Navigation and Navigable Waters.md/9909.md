### PART 323 - PERMITS FOR DISCHARGES OF DREDGED OR FILL MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
#### ยง 323.4 Discharges not requiring permits.
##### i.e.

(ii) To fall under this exemption, the activities specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section must be part of an established (, on-going) farming, silviculture, or ranching operation and must be in accordance with definitions in ยง 323.4(a)(1)(iii). Activities on areas lying fallow as part of a conventional rotational cycle are part of an established operation. Activities which bring an area into farming, silviculture, or ranching use are not part of an established operation. An operation ceases to be established when the area on which it was conducted has been converted to another use or has lain idle so long that modifications to the hydrological regime are necessary to resume operations. If an activity takes place outside the waters of the United States, or if it does not involve a discharge, it does not need a section 404 permit, whether or not it is part of an established farming, silviculture, or ranching operation.
