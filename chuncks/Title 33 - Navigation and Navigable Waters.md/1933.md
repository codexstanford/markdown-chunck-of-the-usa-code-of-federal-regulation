All moorings shall be so placed that no vessel, when anchored, will at any time extend beyond the limits of the area. Fixed mooring piles or stakes are prohibited seaward of the pier head line. Mariners are encouraged to contact the Raritan Yacht Club Fleet Captain for any additional ordinances or laws and to ensure compliance with additional applicable State and local laws.
