###### Modification of flood control projects.

(d)Modification of a flood control project to increase the level of protection, or to provide protection to a larger area, is beyond the scope of Public Law 84-99 assistance. Such modifications to Federal projects are normally accomplished under congressional authorization and appropriation, or under Continuing Authorities Programs of the Corps. Such modifications to non-Federal projects are normally accomplished by the non-Federal sponsor and local interests. Modifications necessary to preserve the structural integrity of an existing non-Federal flood control project may be funded by the RIP, but such work must meet the criteria established in ยง 203.47 to be eligible for funding under Public Law 84-99.
