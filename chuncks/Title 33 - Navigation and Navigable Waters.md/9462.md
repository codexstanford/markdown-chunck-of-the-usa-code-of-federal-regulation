### PART 209 - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE
#### ยง 209.200 Regulations governing navigable waters.
##### Public hearings.

(f)(1) It is the policy of the Chief of Engineers to conduct his civil works activities in an atmosphere of public understanding, trust, and mutual cooperation and in a manner responsive to public needs and desires. To this end, public hearings are helpful and will be held whenever there appears to be sufficient public interest to justify such action. In case of doubt, a public hearing should be held.

(2) Among the instances warranting public hearings are general public opposition to the promulgation of regulations governing the use and navigation of navigable waters. District Engineers will notify the Division Engineer of the need for a hearing, state the proposed arrangements therefor and obtain his concurrence therein. Public hearings will be held in any case when Congressional interests or responsible local authorities make an official and valid request therefor and such action will fulfill the above-stated policy and objectives.
