(a) The traffic separation scheme in the approaches to Puget Sound other than Rosario Strait consists of a northeast/southwest approach, a northwest/southeast approach, a north/south approach, and an east/west approach and connecting precautionary areas.

(b) In the northeast/southwest approach consisting of two separation zones, two precautionary areas ("RA" and "ND"), and four traffic lanes, the following are established:

(1) A separation zone that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(2) Precautionary area "RA," which is contained within a circle of radius 1.24 miles centered at 48&#xB0;19.77&#x2032; N, 122&#xB0;58.57&#x2032; W.

(3) A separation zone that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(4) A traffic lane for northbound traffic that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(5) A traffic lane for northbound traffic that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(6) A traffic lane for southbound traffic that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(7) A traffic lane for southbound traffic that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(8) Precautionary area "ND," which is bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:

Thence along the shoreline to the point of beginning (48&#xB0;11.00&#x2032; N.; 123&#xB0;06.58&#x2032; W.).

(c) In the northwest/southeast approach consisting of two separation zones, two precautionary areas ("RA" and "SA"), and four traffic lanes, the following are established:

(1) A separation zone that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(2) A separation zone that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(3) A traffic lane for northbound traffic that connects with precautionary "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(4) A traffic lane for northbound traffic that connects with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(5) A traffic lane for southbound traffic that connects with precautionary "RA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(6) A traffic lane for southbound traffic connecting with precautionary area "RA," as described in paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, and is located between the separation zone described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(7) Precautionary area "SA," which is contained within a circle of radius 2 miles centered at geographical position 48&#xB0;11.45&#x2032; N, 122&#xB0;49.78&#x2032; W.

(d) In the north/south approach between precautionary areas "RB" and "SA," as described in paragraph (b)(2) and (c)(7) of this section, respectively, the following are established:

(1) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(2) A traffic lane for northbound traffic located between the separation zone described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(3) A traffic lane for southbound traffic located between the separation zone described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(e) In the east/west approach between precautionary areas "ND" and "SA," as described in paragraphs (b)(8) and (c)(7) of this section, respectively, the following are established:

(1) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(2) A traffic lane for northbound traffic between the separation zone described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:

(3) A traffic lane for southbound traffic between the separation zone described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and a line connecting the following geographical positions:
