During the enforcement period persons and vessels wishing to remain inside the RNA must abide by the following stipulations:

(1) No person or vessel may enter into an exclusionary area 3.7 nautical miles long by 1 nautical mile wide, centered lengthwise and along a line running seaward at 208 degrees southwest of Honolulu Harbor Front Range Light, except to transit to or from the staging areas or other areas outside the zone. Loitering or lingering in the exclusionary zone is prohibited.

(2) The Western Recreational Vessel Staging area is bound by the following points: 21&#xB0;17&#x2032;14&#x2033; N, 157&#xB0;55&#x2032;34&#x2033; W; 21&#xB0;13&#x2032;30&#x2033; N, 157&#xB0;55&#x2032;34&#x2033; W; 21&#xB0;13&#x2032;30&#x2033; N, 157&#xB0;55&#x2032;17&#x2033; W; 21&#xB0;16&#x2032;46&#x2033; N, 157&#xB0;53&#x2032;23&#x2033; W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. This staging area is intended for recreational vessels departing from and returning to the Keehi Lagoon area.

The Commercial Vessel Staging Area borders this staging area's western edge. The dividing line between the Commercial Vessel Staging Area and the Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area can be determined visually. The private dayboards located in the Ala Wai Small Boat Harbor and the La Ronde Rotating Restaurant roof top restaurant form a natural range that mariners can use in daylight hours to gauge the eastern boundary of the Commercial Vessel Staging Area and the western boundary of the Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area. This eastern recreational staging area is intended for use by recreational vessels departing from and returning to the Ala Wai Small Boat harbor and Kewalo Basin.
