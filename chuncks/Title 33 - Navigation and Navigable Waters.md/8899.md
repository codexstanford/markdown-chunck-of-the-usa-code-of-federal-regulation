##### Railroad Bridge Signals.

(i)The following signals at the Buzzards Bay Railroad Bridge will be given strict attention.

(1) The vertical lift span on the railroad bridge is normally kept in the raised (open) position except when it is lowered for the passage of trains, or for maintenance purposes. Immediately preceding the lowering of the span, the operator will sound two long blasts of an air horn. Immediately preceding the raising of the span, the operator will sound one long blast of an air horn. When a vessel or craft of any type is approaching the bridge with the span in the down (closed) position and the span cannot be raised immediately, the operator of the bridge will so indicate by sounding danger signals of four short blasts in quick succession.

(2) When the lift span is in the down (closed) position in foggy weather or when visibility is obscured by vapor, there will be four short blasts sounded from the bridge every two minutes.
