(3) All tows entering the restricted area shall be streamed and shortened to the seaward of the area and towing appendages and catenaries shall not be dragged along the bottom while proceeding through the area.

(4) All vessels entering the restricted area shall proceed across the area by the most direct route and without unnecessary delay.

(5) No vessel or craft of any size shall lie-to or anchor in the restricted area at any time other than a vessel operated by or for components, or other vessels authorized by Commander, Navy Region Southwest, or his/her designee.

(6) When security conditions dictate, Naval security forces may impose strict enforcement of stand-off distances within the restricted area. This enforcement will not prevent utilization of navigable channels, but will serve to control its use in order to protect vital National interests.
