######## Speed; high-water precautions.

(2)When passing another vessel (in motion, anchored, or tied up), a wharf or other structure, work under construction, plant engaged in river and harbor improvement, levees withstanding flood waters, building partially or wholly submerged by high water, or any other structure liable to damage by collision, suction or wave action, vessels shall give as much leeway as circumstances permit and reduce their speed sufficiently to preclude causing damages to the vessel or structure being passed. Since this subparagraph pertains directly to the manner in which vessels are operated, masters of vessels shall be held responsible for strict observance and full compliance therewith. During high river stages, floods, or other emergencies, the District Commander may prescribe by navigation bulletins or other means the limiting speed in land miles per hour deemed necessary for the public safety for the entire section or any part of the waterways covered by this paragraph, and such limiting speed shall be strictly observed.
