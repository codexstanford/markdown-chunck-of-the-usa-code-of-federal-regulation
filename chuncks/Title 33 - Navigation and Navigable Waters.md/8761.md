###### Flood Response.

(a)Flood Response measures are applicable to any flood control work where assistance is supplemental to tribal, State, and local efforts, except that Corps assistance is not appropriate to protect flood control works constructed, previously repaired, and/or maintained by other Federal agencies, where such agencies have emergency flood fighting authority. Further, Flood Response measures (except technical assistance) are not appropriate for flood control works protecting strictly agricultural lands. Corps assistance in support of other Federal agencies, or State and local interests, may include the following: technical advice and assistance; lending of flood fight supplies, e.g., sandbags, lumber, polyethylene sheeting, or stone; lending of Corps-owned equipment; hiring of equipment and operators for flood operations; emergency contracting; and similar measures.
