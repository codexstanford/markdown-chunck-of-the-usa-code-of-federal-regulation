######## Regulations.

(b)When the safety zones are activated and, therefore, subject to enforcement, no person or vessel may enter or remain in the safety zone except for support vessels, support personnel, and other vessels authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Honolulu (COTP), or a designated representative of the COTP. All commercial vessels must evacuate the harbor and transit seaward beyond the 50 fathom (300 foot) curve. These commercial harbors will remain closed to all transiting vessels until the Captain of the Port Honolulu lifts the evacuation order. All other applicable regulations in 33 CFR 165 remain in effect and subject to enforcement. You may contact the Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16 (156.800 MHz) or at telephone number 808-842-2600 to obtain clarification on safety zone transits and locations. Coast Guard patrol boats will be enforcing the safety zones and providing on-scene direction. Any vessel not capable of evacuating must contact the Coast Guard Sector Command Center at (808) 842-2601 to request a waiver from evacuating the harbor.
