####### Average most probable discharge.

(d)(1) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel that carries groups I through IV petroleum oil as cargo must identify in the VRP and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the response resources that will respond to a discharge up to the vessel's average most probable discharge (AMPD). Nontank vessels that carry oil as cargo must meet the requirements for AMPD coverage, as applicable, per 33 CFR 155.1050(d).

(2) Nontank vessels that only carry groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel do not have to ensure the availability of AMPD resources by contract or other approved means, but must plan for and identify response resources required in ยง 155.1050(d)(1) and list this information in the applicable geographic-specific appendix for bunkering or fueling operations. Permission or acknowledgement from the listed resource providers is not required.
