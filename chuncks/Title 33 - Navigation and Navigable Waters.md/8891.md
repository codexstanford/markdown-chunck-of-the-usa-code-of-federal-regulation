##### Vessels allowed passage.

(d)The canal is open for passage to all adequately powered vessels properly equipped and seaworthy, of sizes consistent with safe navigation as governed by the controlling depths and widths of the channel and the vertical and horizontal clearances of the bridges over the waterway. The granting of permission for any vessel to proceed through the waterway shall not relieve the owners, agents and operators of full responsibility for its safe passage. No vessel having a greater draft forward than aft will be allowed to transit the canal. Craft of low power and wind driven are required to have and use auxiliary power during passage throughout the canal as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. Low powered vessels will be required to await slack water or favorable current for canal transit.
