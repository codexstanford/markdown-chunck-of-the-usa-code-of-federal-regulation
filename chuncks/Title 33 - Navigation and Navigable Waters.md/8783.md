(c)Rehabilitation under Public Law 84-99 will not be provided for either Federal or non-Federal flood control projects that, as a result of poor maintenance or deterioration, require substantial reconstruction. All deficient or deferred maintenance existing when flood damage occurs will be accomplished by, or at the expense of, the non-Federal sponsor, either prior to or concurrently with authorized rehabilitation work. When work accomplished by the Corps corrects deferred or deficient maintenance, the estimated deferred or deficient maintenance cost will not be included as contributed non-Federal funds, and will be in addition to cost-sharing requirements addressed in ยง 203.82. Failure of project sponsors to correct deficiencies noted during Continuing Eligibility Inspections may result in ineligibility to receive Rehabilitation Assistance under Public Law 84-99.
