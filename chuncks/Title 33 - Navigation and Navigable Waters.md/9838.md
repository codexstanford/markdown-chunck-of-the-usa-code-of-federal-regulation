(k) The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361) expresses the intent of Congress that marine mammals be protected and encouraged to develop in order to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem. The Act imposes a perpetual moratorium on the harassment, hunting, capturing, or killing of marine mammals and on the importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products without a permit from either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, depending upon the species of marine mammal involved. Such permits may be issued only for purposes of scientific research and for public display if the purpose is consistent with the policies of the Act. The appropriate Secretary is also empowered in certain restricted circumstances to waive the requirements of the Act.
