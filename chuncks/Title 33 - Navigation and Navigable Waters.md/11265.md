###### Identification of selected alternative plan.

(3)The guidance memorandum shall also include a process for identification of a selected alternative plan, based on the analyses conducted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The alternative plan to be selected should be the plan that maximizes net benefits, both monetary and non-monetary, on a system-wide basis, provided that this plan is justified on a next-added increment basis. Alternative plans that are not justified on a next-added increment basis shall not be selected. The guidance memorandum shall describe an iterative process for evaluating and/or combining alternative options until an alternative is identified that maximizes net benefits while still providing benefits that justify costs on a next-added increment basis.
