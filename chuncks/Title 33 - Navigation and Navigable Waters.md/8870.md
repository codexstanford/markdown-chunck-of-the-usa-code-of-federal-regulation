(b)Per OMB Circular A-34, all contributed funds must be received in cash and deposited with the Treasury before any obligations can be made against such funds. Public Law 84-99 assistance for well construction is exempted from this requirement because financing is specifically authorized. However, the CA for such well construction assistance (subpart G of this part) must be signed in advance of any obligations. To reduce administrative problems, CA terms for well construction should be for no longer a period than that which will allow for payments within the means of the applicant. Public Law 84-99 limits the term to a maximum of 30 years.
