######## Hazmatstandards@uscg.mil

(d) To apply for certification, the owner or operator of a facility VCS must submit plans, calculations, specifications, and other related information, including a qualitative failure analysis, to the certifying entity. Suggested, but not mandatory, guidance for preparing a qualitative failure analysis can be found in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers publication "Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures," and in Military Standard MIL-STD-882B for a quantitative failure analysis. For assistance in locating those publications, contact the Commandant (CG-ENG), Attn: Office of Design and Engineering Standards, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7509, Washington, DC 20593-7509, telephone 202-372-1418 or via email at. The analysis must demonstrate that-

(1) The VCS can operate continuously and safely while controlling cargo vapors to or from tankships or tank barges over the full range of transfer rates expected at the facility;

(2) The VCS has the proper alarms and automatic shutdown systems required by this subpart to prevent an unsafe operation;

(3) The VCS has sufficient automatic or passive devices to minimize damage to personnel, property, and the environment if an accident were to occur;

(4) If a quantitative failure analysis is also conducted, the level of safety attained is at least one order of magnitude greater than that calculated for operating without a VCS; and

(5) If a facility uses a cargo line pigging system to clear cargo in the cargo line back to the tank vessel with the VCS connected, the qualitative failure analysis must demonstrate that the cargo line pigging system has at least the same levels of safety required by paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to prevent overpressure of the vessel's cargo tanks and account for the probability that the pig is destroyed during line-pigging operations.

(e) The VCS owner or operator must maintain at the facility-

(1) A copy of VCS design documentation, including plans, drawings, calculations, and specifications for the VCS;

(2) The facility operations manual, including the list of cargoes that the facility is approved to vapor control;

(3) Any certification or recertification letter issued under 33 CFR 154.2023; and

(4) Other records as required by 33 CFR 154.740.
