(a) In case of emergency, the Sector Commander, or MSU Commander, with COTP and OCMI authority may order the suspension of cargo transfers at a deepwater port to prevent the discharge, or threat of discharge, of oil or natural gas, or to protect the safety of life and property.

(b) An order of suspension may be made effective immediately.

(c) The order of suspension must state the reasons for the suspension.

(d) The licensee may petition the District Commander to reconsider the order of suspension. The petition must be in writing, unless the order of suspension takes effect immediately, in which case the petition may be made by any means, but the petition does not delay the effective date of the suspension. The decision of the District Commander is considered a final agency action.
