#### ยง 222.2 Acquisition of lands downstream from spillways for hydrologic safety purposes.
##### Location of spillway.

(7)Spillways should be located to minimize the hazards associated with their discharge and the total project cost (cost of spillway structure and downstream lands). Spillways, outlet works, stilling basins, and outlet channels should be designed to minimize hazards to downstream interest insofar as is engineeringly and economically reasonable.
