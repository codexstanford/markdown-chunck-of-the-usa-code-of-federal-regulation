##### Lockage of pleasure craft.

(h)In order to fully utilize the capacity of the lock, lockmasters may expedite the lockage of pleasure craft by locking them through with commercial vessels, except vessels carrying volatile cargoes or other substances likely to emit toxic, flammable, or explosive vapors. If the lockage of pleasure craft cannot be accomplished within the time required for three single lockages, a separate lockage of pleasure craft shall be made. Pleasure craft operators are advised that the locks have a pull chain located at the end of each river wall which signals the lockmaster that lockage is desired.
