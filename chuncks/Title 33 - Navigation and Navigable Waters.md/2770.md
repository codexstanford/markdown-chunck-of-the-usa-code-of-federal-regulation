The span will remain in the closed position for the entire time the track circuit is occupied displaying red lights.

(5) After the train has cleared the track circuit, the span shall open and green lights will be displayed.

(6) From 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., the bridge will be in the closed to navigation position and will open if at least a three hour advance notice is requested via marine radio channel 9 VHF or telephone (813) 677-3974.
