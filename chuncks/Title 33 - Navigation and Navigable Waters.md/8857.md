###### Furnishing of LERRD's.

(a)This item provides for sites of structures, for borrow and disposal areas, and for access. It also provides for all other rights in, upon, through, or over private property as needed by the United States in connection with the authorized work. Performance by the local interests under their assurance to furnish LERRD's will normally not be considered a contribution. If more advantageous to the Federal Government, borrow and disposal areas may be assumed as a Federal responsibility. Easements must be provided for future Federal inspection of maintenance or removal. If a public agency sponsors a project for a non-public applicant, the applicant must provide an easement to the sponsor for future maintenance or removal, as well as for Federal inspection. Easements should extend to the life of the project.
