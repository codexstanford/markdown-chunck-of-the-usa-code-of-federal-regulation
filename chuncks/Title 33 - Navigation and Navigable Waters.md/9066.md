### PART 207 - NAVIGATION REGULATIONS
#### ยง 207.275 McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River navigation system: use, administration, and navigation.
##### Number of lockages.

No part of a tow shall pass a lock until the whole of the one preceding it shall have passed. The lockmaster may prescribe a departure from the normal order of precedence to achieve the best lock utilization.

(ii) One deckhand, or more if the lockmaster so directs, shall tend the lines at the bow and stern of each section of a tow that transits a lock or moors to the river walls.

(10) Vessels shall enter and leave locks under such control as to prevent any damage to the walls and gates.

(11) Placing or discharging refuse of any description into the lock, on the lock walls, on the esplanade, or on any other government property is prohibited.
