#### ยง 207.50 Hudson River Lock at Troy, N.Y.; navigation.
##### Lockage of pleasure boats.

(e)The lockage of pleasure boats, house boats or like craft shall be expedited by locking them through with commercial craft (other than barges carrying gasoline or highly hazardous materials) in order to utilize the capacity of the lock to its maximum. Lockage of pleasure craft may be made with commercial craft carrying petroleum products other than gasoline, provided a clear distance of at least 100 feet between such vessels can be maintained in the lock. If, after the arrival of such craft, no separate or combined lockage can be accomplished within a reasonable time, not to exceed the time required for three other lockages, then separate lockage shall be made.
