### PART 207 - NAVIGATION REGULATIONS
#### ยง 207.718 Navigation locks and approach channels, Columbia and Snake Rivers, Oreg. and Wash.
##### Mooring in lock.

(k)All vessels must be moored within the lock chamber so that no portion of any vessel extends beyond the lines painted on the lock walls. Moorage within the lock chamber will be to floating mooring bits only and will be accomplished in a proper no-slip manner. Small vessels will not be locked with a large vessel unless the large vessel is so moored (two mooring bits) that no lateral movement is possible. The vessel operator will constantly monitor the position of his vessel and his mooring bit ties to assure that there is no fore or aft movement of his vessel and lateral movement is minimized. Propulsion by vessels within the lock chamber will not be permitted during closure operation of a lock chamber gate or as otherwise directed by the Lock Master.
