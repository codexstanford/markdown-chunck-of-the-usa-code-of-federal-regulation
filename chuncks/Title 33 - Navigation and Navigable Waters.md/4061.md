####### ยง 148.276 When must the application be approved or denied?

(a) In 33 U.S.C. 1504, the Act provides strict timelines for action on a license application, which, if closely observed, can lead to action in just under 1 year. The Coast Guard, in concurrence with MARAD, can suspend the process if an applicant fails to provide timely information or requests additional time to comply with a request.

(b) The Coast Guard must conduct public hearings in each Adjacent Coastal State within 240 days of publishing the notice of receipt of a deepwater port license application.

(c) MARAD issues a Record of Decision (ROD) approving or denying a license application within 90 days after the final public hearing. Actual issuance of a license may not take place until certain conditions imposed by the ROD have been met. Those conditions may include how the applicant must address design, construction, installation, testing, operations, and decommissioning of the deepwater port, or meet the requirements of other agencies.
