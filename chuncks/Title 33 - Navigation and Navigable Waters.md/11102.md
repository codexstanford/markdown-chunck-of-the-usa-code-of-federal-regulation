### PART 336 - FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE EVALUATION OF ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS DREDGING PROJECTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF DREDGED MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE U.S. AND OCEAN WATERS
#### ยง 336.2 Transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal into ocean waters.
##### State permits and licenses.

(c)The terms and legislative history of the ODA leave some doubt regarding whether a state has legal authority to exert control over ocean dumping activities of the Corps in the territorial sea covered under the Act (see section 106(d)). Notwithstanding this legal question, the Corps will voluntarily as a matter of comity apply for state section 401 water quality certification and determine consistency with a Federally-approved coastal zone management plan for Corps ocean disposal of dredged material within the three-mile extent of the territorial sea. Moreover, the Corps will attempt to comply with any reasonable requirement imposed by a state in the course of the 401 certification process or the CZMA consistency determination process. Nevertheless, the Corps reserves its legal rights regarding any case where a state unreasonably denies or conditions a 401 water quality certification for proposed Corps ocean disposal of dredged material within the limits of the territorial sea, or asserts that such disposal would not be consistent with an approved state CZMA plan. If such a circumstance arises, the district engineer shall so notify the division engineer who then decides on consultation with CECW-D, CECW-Z, and CECC-E for purposes of determining the Corps of Engineers' appropriate response and course of action.
