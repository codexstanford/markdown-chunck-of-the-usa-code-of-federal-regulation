### PART 207 - NAVIGATION REGULATIONS
#### ยง 207.260 Yazoo Diversion Canal, Vicksburg, Miss., from its mouth at Kleinston Landing to Fisher Street; navigation.
##### Rafts.

(b)Rafts will be permitted to navigate the canal only if properly and securely assembled. Each section of a raft shall be so secured within itself as to prevent the sinking of any log, and so fastened with chains or wire rope that it cannot be separated or bag out or materially change its shape. All logs, chains, and other means used in assembling rafts shall be in good condition and of ample size and strength to accomplish their purpose. No section of a raft will be permitted to be towed unless the logs float sufficiently high in the water to make it evident that the section will not sink en route. Rafts shall not be of greater dimensions than 50 feet wide by 600 feet long, and if longer than 300 feet they shall be handled by two tugs; and in all cases they must be handled by sufficient tug power to make headway and guide the raft so as to give half the channel to passing vessels.
