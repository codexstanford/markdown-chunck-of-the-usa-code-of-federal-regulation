(a) Each District Commander or Captain of the Port may prohibit any vessel, subject to the provisions of chapter 37 of Title 46, U.S. Code, from operating in the navigable waters of the United States, or from transferring cargo or residue in any port or place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and within the district or zone of that District Commander or Captain of the Port, if the District Commander or the Captain of the Port determines that the vessel's history of accidents, pollution incidents, or serious repair problems creates reason to believe that the vessel may be unsafe or pose a threat to the marine environment.

(b) The authority to issue orders prohibiting operation of the vessels or transfer of cargo or residue under paragraph (a) of this section also applies if the vessel:

(1) Fails to comply with any applicable regulation;

(3) Does not comply with applicable vessel traffic service requirements;

(4) While underway, does not have at least one deck officer on the navigation bridge who is capable of communicating in the English language.

(c) When a vessel has been prohibited from operating in the navigable waters of the United States under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the District Commander or Captain of the Port may allow provisional entry into the navigable waters of the United States, or into any port or place under the jurisdiction of the United States and within the district or zone of that District Commander or Captain of the Port, if the owner or operator of such vessel proves to the satisfaction of the District Commander or Captain of the Port, that the vessel is not unsafe or does not pose a threat to the marine environment, and that such entry is necessary for the safety of the vessel or the persons on board.

(d) A vessel which has been prohibited from operating in the navigable waters of the United States, or from transferring cargo or residue in a port or place under the jurisdiction of the United States under the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b)(1), (2) or (3) of this section, may be allowed provisional entry if the owner or operator proves, to the satisfaction of the District Commander or Captain of the Port that has jurisdiction, that the vessel is no longer unsafe or a threat to the environment, and that the condition which gave rise to the prohibition no longer exists.
