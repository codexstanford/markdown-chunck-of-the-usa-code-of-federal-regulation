##### Proffered permit

means a permit that is sent to an applicant that is in the proper format for the applicant to sign (for a standard permit) or accept (for a letter of permission). The term "initial proffered permit" as used in this part refers to the first time a permit is sent to the applicant. The initial proffered permit is not an appealable action. However, the applicant may object to the terms or conditions of the initial proffered permit and, if so, a second reconsidered permit will be sent to the applicant. The term "proffered permit" as used in this part refers to the second permit that is sent to the applicant. Such proffered permit is an appealable action.
