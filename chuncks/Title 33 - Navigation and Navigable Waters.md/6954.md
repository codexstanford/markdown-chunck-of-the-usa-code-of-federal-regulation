####### ยง 165.777 Security Zone; West Basin, Port Canaveral Harbor, Cape Canaveral, Florida.
######## Requirement.

(b)(1) This security zone will be activated 4 hours prior to the scheduled arrival of a cruise ship at the West Basin of Port Canaveral Harbor during MARSEC Levels 2 and 3 or when the COTP determines there is a specified credible threat during MARSEC Level 1. This security zone will not be deactivated until the departure of all cruise ships from the West Basin. The zone is subject to enforcement when it is activated.

(2) Under general security zone regulations of 33 CFR 165.33, no vessel or person may enter or navigate within the regulated area unless specifically authorized by the COTP or the COTP's designated representative. Any person or vessel authorized to enter the security zone must operate in strict conformance with any direction given by the COTP or a designated representative and leave the security zone immediately if so ordered.

(3) The public will be notified when the security zone is activated by the display of a red ball on a 50-foot pole located at the east end of Cruise Ship terminal 10. This red ball will be lowered when the security zone is deactivated. To ensure boaters are given sufficient knowledge of the security zone, the Coast Guard will continuously broadcast the activations of the zone and law enforcement vessels will be on scene to inform boaters that the zone has been activated. Vessels encroaching on the security zone will be issued a Public Notice which clearly states the location of the security zone and the times it will be enforced. This will be the boater's first warning prior to enforcement action being taken.
