###### Speed, high-water precautions.

(v)When passing another vessel (underway, anchored, or tied up); a wharf or other structure; work under construction; plant engaged in river and harbor improvement; levees withstanding flood waters; buildings partially or wholly submerged by high water; or any other structure liable to damage by collision, suction or wave action; vessels shall give as much leeway as circumstances permit and reduce their speed sufficiently to preclude causing damage to the vessel or structure being passed. As deemed necessary for public safety during high river stages, floods, or other emergencies, the District Commander may prescribe, by navigation bulletins or other means, the limiting speed in knots or temporarily close the waterway or any reach of it to traffic. Since this subparagraph pertains directly to the manner in which vessels are operated, masters of vessels shall be held responsible for strict observance and full compliance herewith.
