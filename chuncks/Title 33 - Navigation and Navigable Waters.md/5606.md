###### Method of determining a value for J.

(a)(1) For tank vessels for 20,000 DWT, J = 0.45.

(2) For tank vessels of 200,000 DWT or more:

(i) J = 0.30; or

(ii) J = the greater of 0.20, or

For values of DWT between 200,000 and 300,000 DWT, 300,000 and 420,000 DWT, and greater than 420,000 DWT, the value of "a" is determined by linear interpolation.

(3) For values of DWT between 20,000 and 200,000 DWT, the value of "J" is determined by linear interpolation between 0.45 and 0.30 respectively.
