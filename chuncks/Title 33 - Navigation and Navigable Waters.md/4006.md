####### Site plan for marine components.

(m)A site plan consisting of the following:

(1) The proposed size and location of all:

(i) Fixed and floating structures and associated components seaward of the high water mark, only if the proposal does not involve a connected action, for example, installation of new pipeline extending inshore of the state boundary line;

(ii) Recommended ships' routing measures and proposed vessel traffic patterns in the deepwater port area, including aids to navigation; and

(iii) Recommended anchorage areas and, for support vessels, mooring areas; and

(2) A reconnaissance hydrographic survey of the proposed marine site. This survey should provide data on the water depth, prevailing currents, cultural resources, and a general characterization of the sea bottom. A requirement to submit an engineering hydrographic survey of the final marine site will be imposed as a condition in the license. The latter survey will require more extensive analysis of the soil, and detailed study to determine its physical composition, such as minerals, and if the sea bottom can support fixed components comprising a deepwater port. The applicant may submit existing data, gathered within the previous 5 years, but it must be supplemented by field data for the specific locations in which a high degree of variability exists.
