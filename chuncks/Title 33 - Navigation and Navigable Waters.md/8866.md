###### Adequacy of requirements of local cooperation.

(d)In determining the adequacy of the pledge of local cooperation, district/division commanders must consider the local sponsor's performance capability, taking into account any shortcomings in meeting prior commitments. Local sponsors should make provisions to establish and provide resources for a "Contingency Fund" to meet future maintenance requirements if apparent inadequacies of protective works indicate maintenance costs will be unusually high. Local sponsors should make provisions to establish and provide resources for a "Capital Improvement Fund" to meet future costs of capital improvement projects such as replacement of culverts in levees, pump station equipment, etc.
