## Chapter II - Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, Department of Defense
### PART 245 - REMOVAL OF WRECKS AND OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS
#### ยง 245.45 Abandonment.
##### Establishing abandonment.

(a)Abandonment is the surrendering of all rights to a vessel (or similar obstruction) and its cargo by the owner, or owners if vessel and cargo are separately owned. In all cases other than emergency, abandonment will be established as a precondition to Corps removal, to avoid a "taking" of private property for public purposes. Abandonment is established by either:

(1) Affirmative action on the part of the owner declaring intention to abandon, or

(2) Failure to commence immediate removal of the obstruction and prosecute such removal diligently.
