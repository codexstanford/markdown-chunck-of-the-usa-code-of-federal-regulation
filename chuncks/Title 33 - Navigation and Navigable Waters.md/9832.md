(e) The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a,), the Migratory Marine Game-Fish Act (16 U.S.C. 760c-760g), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661-666c) and other acts express the will of Congress to protect the quality of the aquatic environment as it affects the conservation, improvement and enjoyment of fish and wildlife resources. Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 transferred certain functions, including certain fish and wildlife-water resources coordination responsibilities, from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of Commerce. Under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and Reorganization Plan No. 4, any federal agency that proposes to control or modify any body of water must first consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, and with the head of the appropriate state agency exercising administration over the wildlife resources of the affected state.
