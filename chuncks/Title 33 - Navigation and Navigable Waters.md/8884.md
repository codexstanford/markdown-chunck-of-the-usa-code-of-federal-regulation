##### Signals.

(l)(1) All craft desiring lockage shall, on approaching the locks, signal by two long and two short blasts of a whistle or other sound device. Two long blasts from the lock in reply will indicate a delayed opening and direct the craft not to enter the lock.

(2) Lights are located at each end of each lock and will normally show red. No vessel shall come within 100 feet of the outside of any gate when the signal is red except when so directed by the superintendent.

(3) Fireboats and craft owned by the U.S. Government shall be given prompt and preferential lockage when they sound four long blasts.

(4) No vessel shall move into or out of any lock until the controlling signal is green. A green light in addition to audio loud speakers, operated by the superintendent or his assistants, will direct craft through the locks.

(5) It shall be the duty of every master or person in charge of any vessel to ascertain by personal observation that the lock gate is fully open before proceeding.
