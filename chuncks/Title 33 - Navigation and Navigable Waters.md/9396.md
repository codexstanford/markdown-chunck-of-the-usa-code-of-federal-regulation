## Chapter II - Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, Department of Defense
### PART 208 - FLOOD CONTROL REGULATIONS
#### ยง 208.11 Regulations for use of storage allocated for flood control or navigation and/or project operation at reservoirs subject to prescription of rules and regulations by the Secretary of the Army in the interest of flood control and navigation.
##### Hydrometeorological instrumentation.

(6)The project owner will provide instrumentation in the vicinity of the damsite and will provide communication equipment necessary to record and transmit hydrometeorological and reservoir data to all appropriate Federal authorities on a real-time basis unless there are extenuating circumstances or are otherwise provided for as a condition of the license or permit. For those projects where the owner retains responsibility for real-time implementation of the water control plan, the owner will also provide or arrange for the measurement and reporting of hydrometeorological parameters required within and adjacent to the watershed and downstream of the damsite, sufficient to regulate the project for flood control and/or navigation in an efficient manner. When data collection stations outside the immediate vicinity of the damsite are required, and funds for installation, observation, and maintenance are not available from other sources, the Corps of Engineers may agree to share the costs for such stations with the project owner. Availability of funds and urgency of data needs are factors which will be considered in reaching decisions on cost sharing.
