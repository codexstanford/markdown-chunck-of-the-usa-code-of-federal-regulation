### PART 207 - NAVIGATION REGULATIONS
#### ยง 207.750 Puget Sound Area, Wash.
##### Obstructing navigation.

(10)(i) All vessels and tows passing through the canal shall be kept as close as practicable to the center or, when safer, to the right side of the waterway, except when passing other craft or preparing to moor at a pier or wharf. Slowly moving log rafts, tows, or vessels shall, whenever practicable, pull out of the way when meeting other vessels or when other traffic proceeding in the same direction desires to pass. Vessels are forbidden to obstruct the canal in any way or to delay by slow passage through the canal the progress of other vessels. Small and readily maneuverable vessels operating in the vicinity of larger, less maneuverable vessels shall, in all cases, keep clear and operate with caution in order that the larger vessels may maintain safe steerage way and that hazards to all vessels may be reduced. All vessels shall operate with extreme caution and movements shall be made only when adequate precautions for the safety of other vessels and property are being effectively employed.

(ii) The placing of logs, vessels, or other floating objects within the limits of the dredged channels or anywhere in the canal where they may interfere with navigation to or from piers or industrial plants is prohibited.
