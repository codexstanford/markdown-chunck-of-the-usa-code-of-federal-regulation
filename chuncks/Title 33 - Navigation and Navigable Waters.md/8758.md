##### ยง 203.21 Disaster preparedness responsibilities of non-Federal interests.
###### Training and plans.

(c)Training personnel to operate, maintain, and patrol flood control projects during crisis situations is a non-Federal responsibility. Specific plans should be developed and in place to address known problem areas. For instance, the non-Federal sponsor of a levee reach prone to boils should have personnel specifically trained in flood fighting boils. In addition, contingency plans must be made when needed to address short term situations. For instance, if a culvert through a levee is being replaced, then the contingency plan should address all actions needed should a flood event occur during the construction period when levee integrity is lacking.
