## Chapter I - Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security
### Subchapter J - Bridges
#### PART 118 - BRIDGE LIGHTING AND OTHER SIGNALS
##### ยง 118.160 Vertical clearance gauges.

(a) When necessary for reasons of safety of navigation, the District Commander may require or authorize the installation of clearance gauges. Except as specified in ยง 117.47(b) of this chapter for certain drawbridges, clearance gauges must meet the requirements of this section.

(b) Clearance gauges must indicate the vertical distance between "low steel" of the bridge channel span (in the closed to navigation position for drawbridges) and the level of the water, measured to the bottom of the foot marks, read from top to bottom. Each gauge must be installed on the end of the right channel pier or pier protection structure facing approaching vessels and extend to a reasonable height above high water so as to be meaningful to the viewer. Other or additional locations may be prescribed by the District Commander if particular conditions or circumstances warrant.
