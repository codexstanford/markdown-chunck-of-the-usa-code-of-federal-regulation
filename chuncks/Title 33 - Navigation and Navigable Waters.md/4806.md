###### § 154.1045 Response plan development and evaluation criteria for facilities that handle, store, or transport Group I through Group IV petroleum oils.

(a) The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils shall use the criteria in this section to evaluate response resources identified in the response plan for the specified operating environment.

(1) The criteria in Table 1 of appendix C of this part are to be used solely for identification of appropriate equipment in a response plan. These criteria reflect conditions used for planning purposes to select mechanical response equipment and are not conditions that would limit response actions or affect normal facility operations.

(2) The response resources must be evaluated considering limitations for the COTP zones in which the facility operates, including but not limited to-

(i) Ice conditions;

(ii) Debris;

(iii) Temperature ranges;

(iv) Weather-related visibility; and

(v) Other appropriate environmental conditions as determined by the COTP.

(3) The COTP may reclassify a specific body of water or location within the COTP zone. Any reclassifications will be identified by the COTP in the applicable ACP. Reclassifications may be to-

(i) A more stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave conditions exceed the significant wave height criteria during more than 35 percent of the year; or

(ii) A less stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave conditions do not exceed the significant wave height criteria for the less stringent operating environment during more than 35 percent of the year.

(b) Response equipment must-

(1) Meet or exceed the operating criteria listed in Table 1 of appendix C of this part;

(2) Function in the applicable operating environment; and

(3) Be appropriate for the petroleum oil carried.

(c) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to the facility's average most probable discharge. The response resources must include, at a minimum-

(1) 1,000 feet of containment boom or two times the length of the largest vessel that regularly conducts petroleum oil transfers to or from the facility, whichever is greater, and the means of deploying and anchoring the boom available at the spill site within 1 hour of the detection of a spill; and

(2) Oil recovery devices and recovered oil storage capacity capable of being at the spill site within 2 hours of the discovery of a petroleum oil discharge from a facility.

(d) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to a discharge up to the facility's maximum most probable discharge volume.

(1) The response resources must include sufficient containment boom, oil recovery devices, and storage capacity for any recovery of up to the maximum most probable discharge planning volume, as contained in appendix C.

(2) The response resources must be appropriate for each group of petroleum oil identified in § 154.1020 that is handled, stored, or transported by the facility.

(3) These response resources must be positioned such that they can arrive at the scene of a discharge within the following specified times:

(i) The equipment identified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section or in § 154.1040(d) must arrive within the times specified in those paragraphs or that section, as appropriate.

(ii) In higher volume port areas and the Great Lakes, response resources must be capable of arriving on scene within 6 hours of the discovery of a petroleum oil discharge from a facility.

(iii) In all other locations, response resources must be capable of arriving on scene within 12 hours of the discovery of a petroleum oil discharge from a facility.

(4) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may operate with temporarily modified response plan development and evaluation criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate response resources, etc.).

(e) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify the response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to the worst case discharge volume of petroleum oil to the maximum extent practicable.

(1) The location of these response resources must be suitable to meet the response times identified in paragraph (f) of this section for the applicable geographic area(s) of operation and response tier.

(2) The response resources must be appropriate for-

(i) The volume of the facility's worst case discharge;

(ii) Group(s) of petroleum oil as identified in § 154.1020 that are handled, stored, or transported by the facility; and

(iii) The geographic area(s) in which the facility operates.

(3) The response resources must include sufficient boom, oil recovery devices, and storage capacity to recover the worst case discharge planning volumes.

(4) The guidelines in appendix C of this part must be used for calculating the quantity of response resources required to respond at each tier to the worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.

(5) When determining response resources necessary to meet the requirements of this section, a portion of those resources must be capable of use in close-to-shore response activities in shallow water. The following percentages of the response equipment identified for the applicable geographic area must be capable of operating in waters of 6 feet or less depth.

(i) Offshore-10 percent.

(ii) Nearshore/inland/Great Lakes/rivers and canals-20 percent.

(6) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may be permitted to operate with temporarily modified response plan development and evaluation criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate response resources, etc.).

(f) Response equipment identified in a response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must be capable of arriving on scene within the times specified in this paragraph for the applicable response tier in a higher volume port area, Great Lakes, and in other areas. Response times for these tiers from the time of discovery of a discharge are-

(g) For the purposes of arranging for response resources for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)-(4), response equipment identified for Tier 1 plan credit must be capable of being mobilized and en route to the scene of a discharge within 2 hours of notification. The notification procedures identified in the plan must provide for notification and authorization of mobilization of identified Tier 1 response resources-

(1) Either directly or through the qualified individual; and

(2) Within 30 minutes of a discovery of a discharge or substantial threat of discharge.

(h) Response resources identified for Tier 2 and Tier 3 plan credit must be capable of arriving on scene within the time specified for the applicable tier.

(i) The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports groups II through IV petroleum oils within the inland, nearshore, or offshore areas where pre-authorization for dispersant use exists must identify in their response plan, and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, response resources capable of conducting dispersant operations within those areas.

(1) Dispersant response resources must be capable of commencing dispersant-application operations at the site of a discharge within 7 hours of the decision by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator to use dispersants.

(2) Dispersant response resources must include all of the following:

(i) Sufficient volumes of dispersants for application as required by paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Any dispersants identified in a response plan must be of a type listed on the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan Product Schedule (which is contained in 40 CFR part 300, and available online from the U.S. Government Printing Office).

(ii) Dispersant-application platforms capable of delivering and applying the dispersant on a discharge in the amounts as required by paragraph (i)(3) of this section. At least 50 percent of each EDAC tier requirement must be achieved through the use of fixed-wing, aircraft-based application platforms. For dispersant-application platforms not detailed within the EDSP, adequacy of performance criteria must be documented by presentation of independent evaluation materials (e.g., field tests and reports of actual use) that record the performance of the platform.
