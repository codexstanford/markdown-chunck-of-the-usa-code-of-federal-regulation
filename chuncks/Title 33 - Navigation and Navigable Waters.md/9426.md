#### ยง 209.50 Mississippi River Commission: Public observation of Commission meetings.
##### Closing a portion or portions of a meeting.

(e)(1) All Commission meetings shall be open to the public except when the Commission determines that public disclosure of information to be discussed in a portion or portions of a meeting is likely to:

(i) Disclose matters that are (A) specifically authorized under criteria established by Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and (B) in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;

(ii) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission;

(iii) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute [other than the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), provided that such statute: (A) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

(iv) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

(v) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;

(vi) Disclose information of a personal nature when disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(vii) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement purposes, or information which, if written, would be contained in such records. But only to the extent that the production of such records or information would: (A) Interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or to an impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source, and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law-enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national-security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source:

(viii) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed Commission action except: (A) When the Commission has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action or (B) when the Commission is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final Commission action on such proposal;

(ix) Specifically concerns the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding.

(2) In each instance where the Commission determines that a portion or portions of a meeting may be closed to the public, or determines that information may be withheld from the public for one or more of the exemptions listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Commission shall consider and determine whether or not the public interest requires that the portion or portions of the meeting be open to the public and whether or not the public interest requires that the information be released to the public.

(3) Whenever any person whose interest may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Commission close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (e)(1) (v), (vi) or (vii) of this section, the Commission, upon the request of any one of its members, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting.

(4) Action to close a portion or portions of a meeting for one or more of the reasons listed in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (ix) of this section, or to withhold information from the public for one or more of the reasons listed in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (ix) of this section shall be taken only when a majority of the entire membership of the Commission votes to take such action.

(5) A separate recorded vote of the Commission shall be taken with respect to each meeting a portion or portions of which the Commission proposes to close to the public, and a separate vote of the members of the Commission shall be taken to determine whether to withhold information from the public. The vote of each Commissioner participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.

(6) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section, the Commission shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion or portions of a meeting are to be closed to the public, the Commission shall within one day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section make publicly available a written explanation of its action in closing a portion or portions of the meeting together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliations.

(7) For every portion or portions of a meeting closed pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (ix) of this section, the Chief Legal Officer of the Commission shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained in the Commission files.
