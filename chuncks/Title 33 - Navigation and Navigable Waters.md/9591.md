#### ยง 222.2 Acquisition of lands downstream from spillways for hydrologic safety purposes.
##### Debris movement within floodway.

(5)The availability of erodible material in a spillway flow area intensifies the hazards of spillway flow. In fact, debris may be transported to downstream areas that otherwise would not be adversely affected. Extreme erosion may result from high velocities and turbulence. Both debris and erosion must be evaluated and considered.
