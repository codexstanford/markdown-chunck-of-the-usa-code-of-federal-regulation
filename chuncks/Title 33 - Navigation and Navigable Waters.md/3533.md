####### Master Certificate

means a COFR issued by the Director under this subpart to the COFR Operator of one or more vessels that are under the custody of such person solely in the capacity of a builder, repairer, or scrapper, or for the purpose of holding vessels out for sale or lease, where such person does not physically operate the vessels. A Master Certificate covers, automatically, all of the vessels subject to this subpart held by the COFR Operator solely for purposes of construction, repair, scrapping, sale or lease. A vessel which is being operated commercially in any business venture, including the business of building, repairing, scrapping, leasing, or selling (for example, a slop barge used by a shipyard) cannot be covered by a Master Certificate and must have either a current Individual Certificate or, if applicable, a current Fleet Certificate.
