###### ยง 159.125 Visible floating solids: Type I devices.

During the sewage processing test (ยง 159.121) 40 effluent samples of approximately 1 liter each shall be taken from a Type I device at the same time as samples taken in ยง 159.123 and passed expeditiously through a U.S. Sieve No. 12 as specified in ASTM E 11 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 159.4). The weight of the material retained on the screen after it has been dried to a constant weight in an oven at 103 &#xB0;C. must be divided by the volume of the sample and expressed as milligrams per liter. This value must be 10 percent or less of the total suspended solids as determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 or at least 38 of the 40 samples.
