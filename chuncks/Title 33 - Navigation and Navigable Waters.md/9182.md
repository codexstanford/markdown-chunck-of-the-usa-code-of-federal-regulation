#### ยง 207.441 St. Marys Falls Canal and Locks, Mich.; security.
##### Approaching.

(ii)Whenever a tank vessel is approaching the Soo Locks and within the limits of the lock piers (outer ends of the southwest and east center piers) either above or below the locks, no other vessel will be released from the locks in the direction of the approaching tank vessel, unless the tank vessel is certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products, until the tank vessel is within the lock chamber or securely moored to the approach pier. Whenever a tank vessel is within a Soo Lock Chamber, the tank vessel, unless certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products, will not be released from the lock until the channel within the limits of the lock piers either above or below the lock, in the direction of the tank vessel, is clear of vessels or vessels therein are securely moored to the approach pier. This limits movement to a single vessel whenever a tank vessel is within the limits of the lock piers either above or below the locks, unless the tank vessel is certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products. Tank vessels to which this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) applies include those vessels carrying fuel oil, gasoline, crude oil or other flammable liquids in bulk, including vessels that are not certified gas free where the previous cargo was one of these liquids.
