##### Aids to navigation.

(e)The placing of fixed and floating aids to navigation in a navigable water of the United States is within the purview of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Furthermore, these aids are of particular interest to the U.S. Coast Guard because of its control of marking, lighting and standardization of such navigation aids. A Section 10 nationwide permit has been issued for such aids provided they are approved by, and installed in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 330.5(a)(1)). Electrical service cables to such aids are not included in the nationwide permit (an individual or regional Section 10 permit will be required).
