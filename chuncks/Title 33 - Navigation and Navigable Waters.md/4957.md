5.1 The two types of detonation flame arresters covered in this specification are classified as follows:

5.1.1 Type I-Detonation flame arresters acceptable for applications where stationary flames may rest on the device.

5.1.2 Type II-Detonation flame arresters acceptable for applications where stationary flames are unlikely to rest on the device, and further methods are provided to prevent flame passage when a stationary flame occurs. One example of "further methods" is a temperature monitor and an automatic shutoff valve.
