###### ยง 148.105 What must I include in my application?
####### National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).

(bb)A copy of the NPDES Application for Permit to Discharge Short Form D, for applying for a discharge permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and any accompanying studies and analyses. If complete information is not available by the time MARAD must either approve or deny the application for a designated application area under 33 U.S.C. 1504(i)(1), the license for the deepwater port is conditioned upon the applicant receiving the required discharge permit from the EPA before the start of any discharge requiring such a permit. The issuance of the permit demonstrates that all potential water discharges have been satisfactorily analyzed and water quality control measures implemented to mitigate discharges to meet NPDES.
