means that portion of Lake Erie west of a line due south from Point Pelee.

(3) Discharges of bulk dry cargo residue under paragraph (b) of this section are allowed, subject to the conditions listed in Table 151.66(b)(3) of this section.

(4) The master, owner, operator, or person in charge of any commercial vessel must ensure that the vessel's deck is kept broom clean whenever the vessel is in transit.

(5) The master, owner, operator, or person in charge of any commercial vessel must ensure that a dry cargo residue management plan is on board the vessel, is kept available for Coast Guard inspection, and that all operations are conducted in accordance with the plan. A waste management plan meeting the requirements of 33 CFR 151.57 satisfies this requirement, so long as it provides all the information required by this paragraph (b)(5). If the plan is maintained electronically, at least one paper copy of the plan must be on board for use during inspections. The plan must describe the specific measures the vessel employs to ensure the minimization of bulk dry cargo residue discharges, and, at a minimum, must list or describe-

(i) Equipment on board the vessel that is designed to minimize bulk dry cargo spillage during loading and unloading;

(ii) Equipment on board the vessel that is available to recover spilled cargo from the decks and transfer tunnels and return it to the holds or to unloading conveyances;

(iii) Operational procedures employed by the vessel's crew during the loading or unloading of bulk dry cargoes to minimize cargo spillage onto the decks and into the transfer tunnels and to achieve and maintain the broom clean deck condition required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section;

(iv) Operational procedures employed by the vessel's crew during or after loading or unloading operations to return spilled bulk dry cargo residue to the vessel's holds or to shore via an unloading conveyance;

(v) How the vessel's owner or operator ensures that the vessel's crew is familiar with any operational procedures described by the plan;

(vi) The position title of the person on board who is in charge of ensuring compliance with procedures described in the plan;

(vii) Any arrangements between the vessel and specific ports or terminals for the unloading and disposal of the vessel's bulk dry cargo residues ashore; and

(viii) The procedures used and the vessel's operating conditions to be maintained during any unavoidable discharge of bulk dry cargo residue into the Great Lakes.

(6) In determining whether a commercial vessel or person is in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section, Coast Guard personnel may consider-

(i) The extent to which the procedures described in the vessel's DCR management plan reflect current industry standard practices for vessels of comparable characteristics, cargoes, and operations;

(ii) The crew's demonstrated ability to perform tasks for which the DCR management plan holds them responsible;

(iii) Whether equipment described in the DCR management plan is maintained in proper operating condition; and

(iv) The extent to which the crew adheres to the vessel's DCR management plan during actual dry cargo loading and unloading operations and DCR discharge operations.

(c)(1) The master, owner, operator, or person in charge of any commercial ship loading, unloading, or discharging bulk dry cargo in the United States' waters of the Great Lakes and the master, owner, operator, or person in charge of a U.S. commercial ship transporting bulk dry cargo and operating anywhere on the Great Lakes, excluding non-self propelled barges that are not part of an integrated tug and barge unit, must ensure that a written record is maintained on the ship that fully and accurately records information on:

(i) Each loading or unloading operation on the United States' waters of the Great Lakes, or in the case of U.S. commercial ships on any waters of the Great Lakes, involving bulk dry cargo; and

(ii) Each discharge of bulk dry cargo residue that takes place in United States' waters of the Great Lakes, or in the case of U.S. commercial ships on any waters of the Great Lakes.

(2) For each loading or unloading operation, the record must describe:

(i) The date of the operation;

(ii) Whether the operation involved loading or unloading;

(iii) The name of the loading or unloading facility;

(iv) The type of bulk dry cargo loaded or unloaded;

(v) The method or methods used to control the amount of bulk dry cargo residue, either onboard the ship or at the facility;

(vi) The time spent to implement methods for controlling the amount of bulk dry cargo residue; and

(vii) The estimated volume of bulk dry cargo residue created by the loading or unloading operation that is to be discharged.

(3) For each discharge, the record must describe:

(i) The date and time the discharge started, and the date and time the discharge ended;

(ii) The ship's position, in latitude and longitude, when the discharge started and when the discharge ended; and

(iii) The ship's speed during the discharge.

(iv) Records must be certified by the master, owner, operator, or person in charge; must be kept in written form on board the ship for at least 2 years; and must be made available for Coast Guard inspection upon request.
