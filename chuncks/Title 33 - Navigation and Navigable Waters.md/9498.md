##### Nature and amount of reimbursement.

(g)(1) The non-Federal entity may be reimbursed by a payment of cash, or, preferably, by reductions in any non-Federal contribution to the Federal project that may have been required by the legislation authorizing it, or by a combination of cash and such reductions.

(2) The amount of reimbursement shall equal the approved expenditures made by the non-Federal entity for work that would have been accomplished at Federal expense if the entire project were carried out by the Corps of Engineers, and as covered in the agreement under paragraphs (f) (7) and (10) of this section. The amount of reimbursement will not exceed, however, the amount that the District Engineer finds to be a reasonable estimate of the reduction in Federal expenditure resulting from construction by the non-Federal entity.
