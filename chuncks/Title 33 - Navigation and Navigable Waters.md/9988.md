##### Categorical Exclusions,General.

6.-a.Even though an EA or EIS is not legally mandated for any Federal action falling within one of the "categorical exclusions," that fact does not exempt any Federal action from procedural or substantive compliance with any other Federal law. For example, compliance with the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, etc., is always mandatory, even for actions not requiring an EA or EIS. The following activities are not considered to be major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and are therefore categorically excluded from NEPA documentation:

(1) Fixed or floating small private piers, small docks, boat hoists and boathouses.

(2) Minor utility distribution and collection lines including irrigation;

(3) Minor maintenance dredging using existing disposal sites;

(4) Boat launching ramps;

(5) All applications which qualify as letters of permission (as described at 33 CFR 325.5(b)(2)).
