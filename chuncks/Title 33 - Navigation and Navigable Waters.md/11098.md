### PART 336 - FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE EVALUATION OF ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS DREDGING PROJECTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF DREDGED MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE U.S. AND OCEAN WATERS
#### § 336.1 Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.
##### Other state requirements.

(10)District engineers will make all reasonable efforts to comply with state water quality standards and Federally approved coastal zone programs using the procedures of §§ 336.1(b) (8), (9), and 337.2. District engineers should not seek state permits or licenses unless authorized to do so by a clear, explicit, and unambiguous Congressional waiver of Federal sovereign immunity, giving the state authority to impose that requirement on Federal activities (e.g., CWA sections 401 and 404(t), and CZMA section 307 (c)(1) and (c)(2)).
