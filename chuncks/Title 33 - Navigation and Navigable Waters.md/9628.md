##### Methods improvement and staff training.

(5)Division and district commanders are responsible for conducting appropriate programs for improving technical methods applicable to water control activities in their respective areas. Suitable training programs should be maintained to assure a satisfactory performance capability in water control activities. Appropriate coordination of such programs with similar activities in other areas will be accomplished to avoid duplication of effort, and to foster desirable exchange of ideas and developments. Initiative in re-evaluating methods and guidelines previously established in official documents referred to in paragraph (e) of this section is encouraged where needs are evident. However, proposals for major deviations from basic concepts, policies and general practices reflected in official publications will be submitted to CDR USACE (DAEN-CWE) WASH DC 20314 for concurrence or comment before being adopted for substantial application in actual project regulation at field level.
