###### ยง 67.01-15 Classification of structures.
####### In general, where will the different classes of structures be located?

(b)Specific criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may create exceptions, but, in general, structures the farthest from shore are likely to be assigned to Class A and required to have obstruction lights and sound signals that can be detected from the farthest distance. Structures closest to shore are likely to be assigned to Class C and, while subject to requirements to ensure that they are also detectable from a safe distance away, will be required to have the least powerful obstruction lights or sound signals. The location and standards for Class B structures will generally be in between Class A and C structures.
