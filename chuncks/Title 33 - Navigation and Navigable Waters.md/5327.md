(1) The regulations in this subpart have been complied with;

(2) Both the vessel to be lightered and service vessel have, on board, at the time of transfer, a valid Certificate of Inspection, Certificate of Compliance, or a Tank Vessel Examination Letter, as would have been required under 46 U.S.C. 3710 or 3711, had the transfer taken place in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States;

(3) The delivering and receiving vessels have on board at the time of transfer, evidence that each vessel is operating in compliance with section 311(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(j)) and applicable regulations issued under the authority of section 311(j) in the form of a Declaration of Inspection as required by § 156.150 and a vessel response plan if required under part 155 of this chapter; and

(4) The vessel to be lightered has on board, at the time of transfer, an International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) Certificate or equivalent documentation of compliance with Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78), as would be required by part 151 of this chapter for vessels in navigable waters of the United States. The IOPP Certificate or documentation of compliance shall be that prescribed by §§ 151.19 and 151.21 of this chapter, and shall be effective under the same timetable as specified in § 151.19.

The request must include the information described in § 156.215(a) to the extent known, for the initial transfer, and the estimated frequency of subsequent lightering operations. After the entry into force of Annex II to MARPOL 73/78, vessels lightering hazardous materials shall carry an International Pollution Prevention Certificate for the Carriage of Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk (1973), if required by Annex II to MARPOL 73/78, or equivalent documentation of compliance with the annex.

(c) In an emergency, the COTP, upon request, may authorize a deviation from any rule in this part if the COTP determines that its application will endanger persons, property, or the environment.

(d) On vessels conducting lightering operations in a designated lightering zone, an officer or seaman may not work, except in an emergency or a drill, more than 15 hours in any 24-hour period, or more than 36 hours in any 72-hour period, including the 24-hour and 72-hour periods prior to commencing lightering operations.
