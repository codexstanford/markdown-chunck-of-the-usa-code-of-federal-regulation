#### ยง 222.2 Acquisition of lands downstream from spillways for hydrologic safety purposes.
##### Alternative land uses.

(g)In some cases land downstream from spillways can be effectively used for purposes other than hydrologic safety. Therefore, the entire cost of these lands may not be an additional project cost. For example, the lands downstream of a spillway may be used for wildlife management essential to project purposes in lieu of other lands suitable for similar purposes at another location.
