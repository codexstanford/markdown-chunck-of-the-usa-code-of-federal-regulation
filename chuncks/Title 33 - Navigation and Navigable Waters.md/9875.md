### PART 322 - PERMITS FOR STRUCTURES OR WORK IN OR AFFECTING NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
#### ยง 322.3 Activities requiring permits.
##### General.

(a)DA permits are required under section 10 for structures and/or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States except as otherwise provided in ยง 322.4 below. Certain activities specified in 33 CFR part 330 are permitted by that regulation ("nationwide general permits"). Other activities may be authorized by district or division engineers on a regional basis ("regional general permits"). If an activity is not exempted by section 322.4 of this part or authorized by a general permit, an individual section 10 permit will be required for the proposed activity. Structures or work are in navigable waters of the United States if they are within limits defined in 33 CFR part 329. Structures or work outside these limits are subject to the provisions of law cited in paragraph (a) of this section, if these structures or work affect the course, location, or condition of the waterbody in such a manner as to impact on its navigable capacity. For purposes of a section 10 permit, a tunnel or other structure or work under or over a navigable water of the United States is considered to have an impact on the navigable capacity of the waterbody.
