####### Shipboard spill mitigation procedures section.

(c)This section of the VRP must include-

(1) Procedures for the crew to mitigate or prevent any discharge or a substantial threat of a discharge of oil resulting from shipboard operational activities associated with internal or external oil transfers. Responsibilities of vessel personnel should be identified by job title and licensed/unlicensed position, if applicable. These procedures should address personnel actions in reference to-

(i) Internal transfer system leaks;

(ii) Fuel tank overflows;

(iii) Suspected tank or hull leaks;

(iv) Assessment and monitoring activities;

(v) Personnel protection issues;

(vi) Protective equipment;

(vii) Threats to health and safety;

(viii) Containment and other response techniques;

(ix) Isolation procedures;

(x) Decontamination of personnel; and

(xi) Disposal of removed oil and clean-up materials;

(2) Procedures in the order of priority for the crew to mitigate or prevent any discharge or a substantial threat of a discharge in the event of a casualty or emergency as listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (x) of this section. These procedures should be listed separately and reference specific vessel checklists required by the International Ship Management (ISM) Code, Section 8 (Resolution A.741(18), as amended by Resolution MSC.104(73)) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 155.140), or other means that will ensure consideration of all appropriate factors when addressing a specific casualty. In addition to the checklists, specific personnel assignments for anticipated tasks must be identified. Reference to existing fire control plans and muster lists is sufficient to identify personnel responsibilities in the following scenarios-

(i) Grounding or stranding;

(ii) Explosion or fire, or both;

(iii) Collision or allision;

(iv) Hull failure;

(v) Excessive list;

(vi) Containment system failure;

(vii) Submerged and foundered;

(viii) Wrecked and stranded;

(ix) Hazardous vapor release; and

(x) Equipment failure (e.g., main propulsion, steering gear, etc.);

(3) Procedures for the crew to deploy discharge removal equipment if the vessel is equipped with such equipment;

(4) The procedures for internal transfers of fuel in an emergency;

(5) The procedures for ship-to-ship transfers of fuel in an emergency-

(i) The format and content of the ship-to-ship transfer procedures should be consistent with the "Ship to Ship Transfer Guide (Petroleum)," published jointly by the International Chamber of Shipping and the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 155.140);

(ii) The procedures should identify the specific response resources necessary to carry out the internal or external transfers, including-

(A) Fendering equipment (ship-to-ship only);

(B) Transfer hoses and connection equipment;

(C) Portable pumps and ancillary equipment;

(D) Lightering or fuel removal and mooring masters (ship-to-ship only); and

(E) Vessel and barge brokers (ship-to-ship only);

(iii) Reference may be made to a separate fuel oil transfer procedure and lightering plan carried onboard the vessel, if safety considerations are summarized in the plan; and

(iv) The location of all equipment and fittings, if any, carried onboard the vessel to perform the transfers should be identified;

(6) The procedures and arrangements for emergency towing, including the rigging and operation of any emergency towing equipment, if any, carried onboard the vessel;

(7) The location, crew responsibilities, and procedures for use of shipboard equipment that might be carried to mitigate an oil discharge;

(8) The crew's responsibility, if any, for recordkeeping and sampling of spilled oil. Any requirements for sampling must address safety procedures to be followed by the crew;

(9) The crew's responsibilities, if any, to initiate a response and supervise shore-based response resources;

(10) Damage stability and hull stress considerations when performing shipboard mitigation measures. This section of the VRP should identify and describe-

(i) Activities in which the crew is trained and qualified to execute absent shore-based support or advice; and

(ii) The information to be collected by the vessel's crew to facilitate shore-based assistance;

(11) Location of vessel plans necessary to perform salvage, stability, and hull stress assessments-

(i) The vessel owner or operator should ensure that a copy of these plans is maintained ashore by either the vessel owner or operator or the vessel's recognized classification society, unless the vessel has prearranged for a shore-based damage stability and residual strength calculation program with the vessel's baseline strength and stability characteristics pre-entered. The VRP should indicate the shore location and 24-hour access procedures of the calculation program for the following plans, where available-

(A) General arrangement plan;

(B) Midship section plan;

(C) Lines plan or table of offsets;

(D) Tank tables;

(E) Load line assignment; and

(F) Light ship characteristics; and

(ii) The VRP should identify the shore location and 24-hour access procedures for the computerized, shore-based damage stability and residual structural strength calculation programs, if available; and

(12) Procedures for implementing personnel safety mitigation strategies for all personnel involved. These procedures may contain more, but must address the following-

(i) Assessment and monitoring activities;

(ii) Personnel protection issues;

(iii) Protective equipment;

(iv) Threats to health and safety;

(v) Containment and other response techniques;

(vi) Isolation procedures;

(vii) Decontamination of personnel; and

(viii) Disposal of removed oil and clean-up materials.
