######## Vessel Movement Center (VMC)

means the shore-based facility that operates the vessel tracking system for a Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) area or zone within such an area. The VMC does not necessarily have the capability or qualified personnel to interact with marine traffic, nor does it necessarily respond to traffic situations developing in the area, as does a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS).
