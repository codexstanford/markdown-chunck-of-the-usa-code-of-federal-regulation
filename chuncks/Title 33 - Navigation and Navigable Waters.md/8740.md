##### ยง 203.14 Responsibilities of non-Federal interests.
###### Emergency operations.

(b)During emergency operations, non-Federal interests must commit available resources, to include work force, supplies, equipment, and funds. Requests for Corps emergency operations assistance will be in writing from the appropriate State, tribal, or local official. For flood fight direct assistance and Post Flood Response assistance, non-Federal interests must furnish formal written assurances of local cooperation by entering into Cooperation Agreements (CA's), as detailed in subpart G of this regulation. (For Corps work authorized under Public Law 84-99, the term "Cooperation Agreement" is used to differentiate this agreement from a Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) that addresses the original construction of a project.) Following Flood Response or Post Flood Response assistance, it is a non-Federal responsibility to remove expedient flood control structures and similar works installed by the Corps under Public Law 84-99.
