######## Multi-breasted barge-loading operations

are those in which barges load side by side with the outboard barge's vapor collection system connected to a facility vapor connection through the inboard barge, as opposed to single-breasted operations involving a single barge, and may also be known as "two barge, double-up" loading operations.
