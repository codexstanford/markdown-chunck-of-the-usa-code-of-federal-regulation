With the exception of local, State, and Federal law enforcement entities, all persons, vessels, and other craft are prohibited from entering, transiting, anchoring, or drifting within the restricted area when it is closed, unless they have the permission of the Director, KSC or his/her designee.

(2) Due to the nature of this restricted area, closures may occur with little advance notice. Closure of the area shall be noticed by warning statements displayed on the electronic marquee signs located at the gates of the KSC and on an electronic marquee sign located on the north side of the Port Canaveral ship channel between the Trident and Poseidon wharfs during the duration of the closure. If time permits, additional information will be published in area newspapers and announced on marine radio broadcast.
