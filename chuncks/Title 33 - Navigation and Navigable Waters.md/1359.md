####### Escorting

means ensuring that the escorted individual is continuously accompanied while within a secure area in a manner sufficient to observe whether the escorted individual is engaged in activities other than those for which escorted access was granted. This may be accomplished via having a side-by-side companion or monitoring, depending upon where the escorted individual will be granted access. Individuals without TWICs may not enter restricted areas without having an individual who holds a TWIC as a side-by-side companion, except as provided in §§ 104.267, 105.257, and 106.262 of this subchapter.
