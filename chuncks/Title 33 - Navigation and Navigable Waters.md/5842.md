####### Operating exclusively within a single Captain of the Port zone

refers to vessel movements within the boundaries of a single COTP zone, e.g., from one dock to another, one berth to another, one anchorage to another, or any combination of such transits. Once a vessel has arrived in a port in a COPT zone, it would not be considered as departing from a port or place simply because of its movements within that specific port.
