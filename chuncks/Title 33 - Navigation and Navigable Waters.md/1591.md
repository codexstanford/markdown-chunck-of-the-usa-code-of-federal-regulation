####### Drills.

(b)(1) The FSO must ensure that at least one security drill is conducted every 3 months. Security drills may be held in conjunction with non-security drills, where appropriate.

(2) Drills must test individual elements of the FSP, including response to security threats and incidents. Drills should take into account the types of operations of the facility, facility personnel changes, the type of vessel the facility is serving, and other relevant circumstances. Examples of drills include unauthorized entry to a restricted area, response to alarms, and notification of law enforcement authorities.

(3) If a vessel is moored at the facility on the date the facility has planned to conduct any drills, the facility cannot require the vessel or vessel personnel to be a part of or participate in the facility's scheduled drill.
