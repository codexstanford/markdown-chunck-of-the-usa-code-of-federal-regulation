### PART 336 - FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE EVALUATION OF ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS DREDGING PROJECTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF DREDGED MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE U.S. AND OCEAN WATERS
#### ยง 336.1 Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.
##### Navigation and Federal standard.

(1)The maintenance of a reliable Federal navigation system is essential to the economic well-being and national defense of the country. The district engineer will give full consideration to the impact of the failure to maintain navigation channels on the national and, as appropriate, regional economy. It is the Corps' policy to regulate the discharge of dredged material from its projects to assure that dredged material disposal occurs in the least costly, environmentally acceptable manner, consistent with engineering requirements established for the project. The environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, in conjunction with the section 404(b)(1) guidelines and public notice coordination process, can be used as a guide in formulating environmentally acceptable alternatives. The least costly alternative, consistent with sound engineering practices and selected through the 404(b)(1) guidelines or ocean disposal criteria, will be designated the Federal standard for the proposed project.
