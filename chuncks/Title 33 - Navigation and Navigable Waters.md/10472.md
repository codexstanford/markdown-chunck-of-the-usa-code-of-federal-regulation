If the red streamer is displayed, it will indicate that firing is in progress and that the waters in the danger zone are covered by rifle fire, and the area shall not be entered until the streamer is lowered.

(iii) The Post Commander is hereby authorized by using such agencies and equipment necessary to stop all persons and boats at the boundary of the danger zone and prohibit their crossing the area until convenient to the firing schedule to do so.
