## Chapter II - Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, Department of Defense
### PART 322 - PERMITS FOR STRUCTURES OR WORK IN OR AFFECTING NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
#### ยง 322.5 Special policies.
##### Outer continental shelf.

(f)Artificial islands, installations, and other devices located on the seabed, to the seaward limit of the outer continental shelf, are subject to the standard permit procedures of this regulation. Where the islands, installations and other devices are to be constructed on lands which are under mineral lease from the Mineral Management Service, Department of the Interior, that agency, in cooperation with other federal agencies, fully evaluates the potential effect of the leasing program on the total environment. Accordingly, the decision whether to issue a permit on lands which are under mineral lease from the Department of the Interior will be limited to an evaluation of the impact of the proposed work on navigation and national security. The public notice will so identify the criteria.
