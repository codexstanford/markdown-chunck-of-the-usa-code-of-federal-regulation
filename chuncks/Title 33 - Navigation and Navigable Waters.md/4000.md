####### Financial information.

(g)(1) For the applicant, each affiliate with an ownership interest in the applicant of greater than 3 percent, and affiliates which have a direct contractual relationship with the deepwater port:

(i) Annual financial statements, audited by an independent certified public accountant, for the previous 3 years, including, but not limited to, an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement with footnote disclosures prepared according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; provided, however, that the Commandant (CG-5P), in concurrence with MARAD, may waive this requirement upon finding:

(A) That the affiliate does not, in the normal course of business, produce audited statements; and

(B) That the affiliate is part of a larger corporate group whose audited statement provides sufficient information to support an adequate assessment of the affiliate's relationship with and impact on the applicant; and

(ii) Interim income statements and balance sheets for each quarter that ends at least 30 days before submission of the application, unless it is included in the most recent annual financial statement.

(2) An estimate of construction costs, including:

(i) A phase-by-phase breakdown of costs;

(ii) The estimated completion dates for each phase; and

(iii) A preliminary estimate of the cost of removing all of the deepwater port marine components, including pipelines that lie beneath the seabed. The operator of a deepwater port is responsible for the costs associated with removal of all deepwater port components. Should a license be granted, MARAD will require a bond, guarantee, or other financial instrument to cover the complete cost of decommissioning as a condition of the license.

(3) Annualized projections or estimates, along with the underlying assumptions, for the next 5 years and at reasonable intervals throughout the life of the deepwater port, of each of the following:

(i) Total oil or natural gas throughput, and subtotals showing throughput owned by the applicant and its affiliates and throughput owned by others;

(ii) Projected financial statements, including a balance sheet and income statement; and

(iii) Annual operating expenses, showing separately any payment made to an affiliate for any management duties carried out in connection with the operation of the deepwater port.

(4) A copy of all proposals or agreements concerning the management and financing of the deepwater port, including agreements relating to throughputs, capital contributions, loans, guarantees, commitments, charters, and leases.

(5) The throughput reports for the calendar year preceding the date of the application, for the applicant and each of the applicant's affiliates engaged in producing, refining, or marketing oil or natural gas and natural gas liquids, along with a copy of each existing or proposed throughput agreement. Each throughput report must list the throughput of the following products:

(i) Crude oil; and if crude oil is the only product the port is designed to transport, the throughput report may be limited to reporting crude oil;

(ii) Gasoline;

(iii) Jet aviation fuel;

(iv) Distillate fuel oils;

(v) Other refinery products;

(vi) Natural gas; and

(vii) Natural gas liquids.
