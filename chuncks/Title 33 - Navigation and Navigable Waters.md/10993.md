(5)(i) The area will be open unless the Navy is actually conducting operations. To ensure safe and timely passage through the restricted area vessel operators are required to notify the Facility Control Officer of their expected time of arrival, speed and intentions. For vessels not equipped with radio equipment, the Navy shall signal with flashing beacon lights whether passage is prohibited and when it is safe to pass through the area.
