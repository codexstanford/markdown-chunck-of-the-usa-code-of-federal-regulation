###### Loan or issue of supplies and equipment.

(c)(1) Issuance of Government-owned equipment or materials to non-Federal interests is authorized only after local resources have been fully committed.

(2) Equipment that is lent will be returned to the Corps immediately after the flood operation ceases, in a fully maintained condition, or with funds to pay for such maintenance. The Corps may waive the non-Federal interest's responsibility to pay for or perform maintenance if a Stafford Act Presidential emergency or disaster declaration has already been made for the affected locality, and the waiver is considered feasible and reasonable.

(3) Expendable supplies that are lent, such as sandbags, will be replaced in kind, or paid for by local interests. The Corps may waive the local interest's replacement/payment if a Stafford Act Presidential disaster declaration has been made for the affected locality, and the waiver is considered feasible and reasonable. All unused expendable supplies will be returned to the Corps when the operation is terminated.
