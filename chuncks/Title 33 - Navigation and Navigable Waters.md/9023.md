### PART 207 - NAVIGATION REGULATIONS
#### ยง 207.187 Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, Tex.; special floodgate, lock and navigation regulations.
##### Limited passage.

(2)When the current in either river exceeds 2 miles per hour or the head differential at the Brazos River floodgates is between the limits of 0.7 foot and 1.8 feet, both inclusive, or the head differential at the Colorado River locks is 0.7 foot or greater, passage shall be afforded only for single vessels or towboats with single loaded barges or two empty barges. When two barges are rigidly assembled abreast of each other and the combined width of both together is 55 feet or less, they shall be considered as one barge. Each section of an integrated barge shall be considered as one barge, except when it is necessary to attach a rake section to a single box section to facilitate passage, the two sections shall be considered as one barge. It shall be the responsibility of the master, pilot or other person in charge of a vessel to determine whether a safe passage can be effected, give due consideration to the vessel's power and maneuverability, and prevailing current velocity, head differential, weather and visibility. If conditions are not favorable, passage shall be delayed until conditions improve and a safe crossing is assured.
