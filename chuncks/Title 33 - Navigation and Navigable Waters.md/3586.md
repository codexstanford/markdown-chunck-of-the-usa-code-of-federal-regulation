####### Process upon disapproval of guarantor.

(i)If the Director intends to disapprove or revoke the approval of a guarantor (for example, due to the guarantor's change in financial position), the Director will notify the COFR Operator of the need to establish new evidence of financial responsibility within a specified period.

(1) If the COFR Operator establishes, or causes to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Application if otherwise complete will be approved or the COFR will remain in effect, and the COFR Operator will not have to pay a new Application fee or certification fee.

(2) If the COFR Operator fails to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Director may deny or revoke the COFR and, if revoked, the COFR Operator will have to apply for a new COFR and pay a new certification fee. The COFR Operator's failure to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director may also result in enforcement as provided under ยง 138.170.
