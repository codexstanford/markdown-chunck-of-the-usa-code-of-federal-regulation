### PART 245 - REMOVAL OF WRECKS AND OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS
#### ยง 245.10 General policy.
##### Coordination with Coast Guard.

(a)The Corps of Engineers coordinates its wreck removal program with the Coast Guard through interagency agreement, to insure a coordinated approach to the protection of federal interests in navigation and safety. Disagreements at the field level are resolved by referral to higher authority within each agency, ultimately (within the Corps of Engineers) to the Director of Civil Works, who retains the final authority to make independent determinations where Corps responsibilities and activities are affected.
