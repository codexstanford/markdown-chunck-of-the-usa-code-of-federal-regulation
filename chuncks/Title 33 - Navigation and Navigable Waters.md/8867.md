###### Eligibility under other Federal programs.

(e)The Cooperation Agreement must be worded to allow local interests to accept funding from other Federal programs for meeting the local responsibility. For example, removal of temporary works will be without cost under Corps Public Law 84-99 assistance, but will not be "at no cost to the United States." Use of another Federal agency's funds is contingent upon that agency providing the Corps written assurance that such usage does not violate any existing laws or rules concerning the usage or expenditure of such funds.
