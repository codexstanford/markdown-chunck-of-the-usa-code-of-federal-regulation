#### ยง 222.6 National Program for Inspection of Non-Federal Dams.
##### Assessment of the investigation.,i.e.

(v)(A) The findings of the visual inspection and review of existing engineering data for a dam shall be assessed to determine its general condition. Dams assessed to be in generally good condition should be so described in the inspection report. Deficiencies found in a dam should be described and assessed as to the degree of risk they present. The degree of risk should consider only loss of life and/or property damage resulting from flooding due to dam failure. Loss of project benefits, municipal water supply, etc., should not be considered. If deficiencies are assessed to be of such a nature that, if not corrected, they could result in the failure of the dam with subsequent loss of life and/or substantial property damage, the dam should be assessed as "Unsafe." If the probable failure of an "Unsafe" dam is judged to be imminent and immediate action is required to reduce or eliminate the hazard, the "unsafe" condition of the dam should be considered an "emergency." If the probable failure is judged not to be imminent, the "unsafe" condition should be considered a "non-emergency."
