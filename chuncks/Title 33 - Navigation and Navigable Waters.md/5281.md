####### Dispersants.

(j)(1) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel carrying groups II through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo with a capacity of 2,500 barrels or greater that operates in any area pre-authorized for dispersant use must identify in their VRP, and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, response resources capable of conducting dispersant operations within those areas. Vessel owners or operators must meet 33 CFR 155.1050(k). These nontank vessels must meet Tier 1 for dispersant effective daily application capability.

(2) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel with a capacity less than 2,500 barrels, but greater than or equal to 250 barrels, needs to plan for and identify dispersant response resources in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable "other approved means." See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of "Contract or other approved means."
