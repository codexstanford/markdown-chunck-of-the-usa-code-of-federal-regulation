####### Oil discharge monitoring and control system.

(a)(1) The monitoring system must be capable of effectively monitoring and controlling the discharge of any effluent into the sea through those overboard discharge outlets permitted by ยง 157.11 that are necessary to fulfill the operational requirements of the oil tanker.

(2) The discharge of dirty ballast water or other oil-contaminated water from the cargo tank areas into the sea through outlets, which are not controlled by the monitoring system is prohibited.

(3) The monitoring system must function effectively under all environmental conditions normally encountered by oil tankers, and must be designed and constructed to satisfy the specifications for approval in 46 CFR subpart 162.050. Moreover-

(i) The system must be designed so a discharge of dirty-ballast or other oil-contaminated water from the cargo tank areas cannot take place unless the monitoring system is in the normal operating mode and the relevant sampling point has been selected;

(ii) The system should sample the effluent discharge from a minimum number of discharge outlets and be arranged so that discharge overboard can take place via only one outlet at a time;

(iii) Where it is intended that more than one line be used for simultaneous discharging purposes, one oil content meter, together with a flow meter, must be installed in each discharge line. These instruments must be connected to a common processor; and

(iv) To avoid alarms because of short-term high-oil-concentration signals (spikes) causing indications of high instantaneous rates of discharge, the short-term high ppm signal may be suppressed for a maximum of 10 seconds. Alternatively, the instantaneous rate of discharge may be continuously averaged during the preceding 20 seconds or less as computed from instantaneous ppm values of the oil content meter readings received at intervals not exceeding 5 seconds.

(4) The monitoring system must comprise-

(i) An oil content meter to measure the oil content of the effluent in ppm. The meter must be approved in accordance with the provisions contained in 46 CFR subpart 162.050 and certified to take into account the range of cargoes carried;

(ii) A flow rate indicating system to measure the rate of effluent being discharged into the sea;

(iii) A ship speed indicating device to give the ship's speed in knots;

(iv) A ship position indicating device to give the ship's position-latitude and longitude;

(v) A sampling system to convey a representative sample of the effluent to the oil content meter;

(vi) An overboard discharge control to stop the overboard discharge;

(vii) A starting interlock to prevent the discharge overboard of any effluent unless the monitoring system is fully operational; and

(viii) A control section comprising-

(A) A processor that accepts signals of oil content in the effluent, the effluent flow rate, and the ship's speed, and computes these values into liters of oil discharged per nautical mile and the total quantity of oil discharged;

(B) A means to provide alarms and command signals to the overboard discharge control;

(C) A recording device to provide a record of data required under ยง 157.12d(h)(2);

(D) A data display to exhibit the current operational data required under ยง 157.12d(i);

(E) A manual override system to be used in the event of failure of the monitoring system;

(F) A means to provide signals to the starting interlock to prevent the discharge of any effluent before the monitoring system is fully operational; and

(G) The control section of the monitoring system must be tested in accordance with the vibration testing requirements described in 46 CFR 162.050-37.

(5) Each main component of the monitoring system must be fitted with a name plate, properly identifying the component by assembly drawing number, type or model number, and serial number, as appropriate.

(6) The electrical components of the monitoring system that are to be installed in an explosive atmosphere must be in compliance with 46 CFR 162.050-25.

(7) Each main component of the monitoring system must be designed in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in subchapters F and J.
