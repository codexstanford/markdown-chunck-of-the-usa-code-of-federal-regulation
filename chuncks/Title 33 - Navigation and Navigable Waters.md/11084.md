##### Applicable laws.

(a)Section 404 of the CWA governs the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. Although the Corps does not process and issue permits for its own activities, the Corps authorizes its own discharges of dredged or fill material by applying all applicable substantive legal requirements, including public notice, opportunity for public hearing, and application of the section 404(b)(1) guidelines.

(1) The CWA requires the Corps to seek state water quality certification for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.

(2) Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires that certain activities that a Federal agency conducts or supports be consistent with the Federally-approved state management plan to the maximum extent practicable.
