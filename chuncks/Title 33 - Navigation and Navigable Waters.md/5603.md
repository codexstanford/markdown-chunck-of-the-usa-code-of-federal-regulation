###### Characteristic and Condition Assumption for Calculations.

4.

(a) Account must be taken of any empty or partially filled tanks, the specific gravity of cargoes carried, and any outflow of liquids from damaged compartments.

(b) The permeabilities are assumed as follows:

(c) The buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage is to be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage may be taken into consideration if they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place. Class I doors are allowed in watertight bulkheads in the superstructure.

(d) The free surface effect is to be calculated:

(1) at an angle of heel of 5 degrees for each individual compartment; or

(2) by assessing the shift of liquids by moment of transference calculations.

(e) In calculating the effect of free surfaces of consumable liquids, it is to be assumed that, for each type of liquid, at least one transverse pair or a single centerline tank has a free surface and the tank or combination of tanks to be taken into account is to be those where the effect of free surface is the greatest.
