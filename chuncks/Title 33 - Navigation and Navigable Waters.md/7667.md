######## Precautionary Area Regulations.

(c)(1) A vessel in a precautionary area which is depicted on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nautical charts, except precautionary "RB" (a circular area of 2,500 yards radius centered at 48-26&#x2032;24&#x2033; N., 122-45&#x2032;12&#x2033; W.), must keep the center of the precautionary area to port.

(2) The Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Service (PSVTS) may, upon verbal request, authorize a onetime deviation from paragraph (c)(1) of this section for a voyage, or part of a voyage, if the proposed deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to or beyond that provided by the required procedure. The deviation request must be made well in advance to allow the requesting vessel and the Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) sufficient time to assess the safety of the proposed deviation. Discussions between the requesting vessel and the VTC should include, but are not limited to, information on the vessel handling characteristics, traffic density, radar contacts, and environmental conditions.

(3) In an emergency, the master, pilot, or person directing the movement of the vessel may deviate from paragraph (c)(1) of this section to the extent necessary to avoid endangering persons, property, or the environment, and shall report the deviation to the VTC as soon as possible.
