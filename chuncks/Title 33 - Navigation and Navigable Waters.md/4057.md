####### ยง 148.252 What is the procedure for serving a subpoena?

(a) A party may submit a request for a subpoena to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The request must show the relevance and scope of the evidence sought.

(b) Requests should be submitted sufficiently in advance of the hearing so that exhibits and witnesses can be included in the lists required by ยง 20.601 of this chapter, but may be submitted later and before the end of the hearing, if good cause is shown for the late submission.

(c) A request for a subpoena must be submitted to the ALJ.
