The E-200 North Main Street Bridge, mile 293.15, over the Erie Canal, in Albion, NY will be rehabilitated with under bridge vehicles. The Bridge will remain in the open to navigation position for the duration of the project. Spotters will warn of approaching vessels and move the man lift to allow vessels to pass. Bridge lighting will be temporarily replaced with steady burning yellow lights on the bottom and four-corners of the bridge where they can best be seen by vessels approaching from up river or down river of the bridge.
