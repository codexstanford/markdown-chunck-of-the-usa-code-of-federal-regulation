###### Economic justification.

(d)No flood control work will be rehabilitated unless the work required satisfies Corps criteria for a favorable benefit-to-cost ratio, and the construction cost of the work required exceeds $15,000. Construction costs greater than $15,000 do not preclude the Corps from making a determination that the required work is a maintenance responsibility of the non-Federal sponsor, and not eligible for Corps Rehabilitation Assistance.
