#### ยง 221.1 Investigation and supervision of hydropower projects under the Federal Power Act (ER 1140-2-4).
##### Preliminary permit application.

(4)An application filed by a non-Federal entity with the FERC as a preliminary step in anticipation of filing for a license to construct and operate a hydroelectric project. A preliminary permit does not authorize construction. It merely gives the permittee priority of application for a FERC license over other non-Federal entities for a period of time. The permittee then develops information necessary for inclusion in an application for license to construct and operate a hydroelectric project. Analysis of this information may result in a decision to apply for the license or to withdraw the intent.
