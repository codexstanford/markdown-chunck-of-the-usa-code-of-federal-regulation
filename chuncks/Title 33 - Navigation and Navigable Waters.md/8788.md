##### ยง 203.48 Inspection guidelines for non-Federal flood control works.
###### Intent.

(a)The intent of these guidelines is to facilitate inspections of the design, construction, and maintenance of non-Federal flood control works. The guidelines are not intended to establish design standards for non-Federal flood control works, but to provide uniform procedures within the Corps for conducting required inspections. The results of these inspections determine Active status in the RIP, and thus determine eligibility for Rehabilitation Assistance. The contents of this section are applicable to both IEI's and CEI's.
