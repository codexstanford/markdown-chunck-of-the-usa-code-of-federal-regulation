##### Entrance to an exit from locks.

(6)No vessel or raft shall enter or leave locks before being signaled to do so. While waiting their turn, vessels or rafts must not obstruct navigation and must remain at a safe distance from locks. Before entering a lock they shall take position in the rear of any vessels or rafts that precede them, and there arrange the tow for locking in sections if necessary. Masters and pilots of vessels or persons in charge of rafts shall cause no undue delay in entering or leaving locks upon receiving the proper signal. They shall take such action as will insure that the approaches are not at any time unnecessarily obstructed by parts of a tow awaiting lockage or already passed through. They shall provide sufficient men to move through locks promptly without damage to the structures. Vessels or tows shall enter locks with reasonable promptness after being signaled to do so.
