####### Soil data.

(n)An analysis of the general character and condition of the ocean bottom, sub-bottom, and upland soils throughout the marine site. The applicant may use existing data, so long as it was collected within the last 5 years and continues to provide accurate information about conditions throughout the site. If not, a new survey must be completed to provide supplemental data. The analysis must include an opinion by a registered professional engineer specializing in soil mechanics concerning:

(1) The suitability of the soil to accommodate the anticipated design load of each marine component that will be fixed to or supported on the ocean floor; and

(2) The stability of the seabed when exposed to environmental forces resulting from severe storms or lesser forces that occur over time, including any history of accretion or erosion of the coastline near the marine site.
