####### Inactive vessel

means a vessel that is out of service or laid up and has emptied its tanks of fuel except for the minimum amount of fuel necessary for the maintenance of the vessel's material condition. Such a vessel is considered not to be operating on the navigable waters of the United States for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5), unless the cognizant COTP determines that it poses an unacceptable risk to the marine environment due to the amount of oil carried for maintenance. A vessel would not be considered inactive if it carried oil as a cargo or cargo residue.
