##### § 385.26 Project Implementation Reports.
###### General requirements.

(a)(1) The Project Implementation Report is a document that provides information on plan formulation and evaluation, engineering and design, estimated benefits and costs, environmental effects, and the additional information and analysis necessary for the Secretary of the Army to approve the project for implementation, or for Congress to authorize the project for implementation. The Project Implementation Report bridges the gap between the conceptual level of detail contained in the "Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement," dated April 1, 1999 and the detailed design necessary to prepare plans and specifications required to proceed to construction. Prior to requesting approval or authorization for the implementation of a project, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, complete a Project Implementation Report addressing the project's justification in accordance with section 601(f)(2) of WRDA 2000, and other factors required by section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000. To eliminate duplication with State and local procedures, the Project Implementation Report shall also address the factors of relevant State laws, including sections 373.1501 and 373.470 of the Florida Statutes.

(2) Before completion of the draft Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall provide the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force with information about the alternative plans developed and evaluated for the Project Implementation Report.

(3) The Project Implementation Report shall:

(i) Be consistent with the Plan and applicable law, policy, and regulation, including the Principles and Guidelines of the Water Resources Council, as modified by section 601(f)(2)(A) of WRDA 2000;

(ii) Be based on the best available science;

(iii) Comply with all applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws;

(iv) Contain sufficient information for proceeding to final design of the project, such as: additional plan formulation and evaluation, environmental and/or economic benefits, engineering and design, costs, environmental impacts, real estate requirements, and the preparation of the appropriate National Environmental Policy Act documentation;

(v) Contain the information necessary to determine that the activity is justified by the environmental benefits derived by the South Florida ecosystem in accordance with section 601(f)(2)(A) and/or that the benefits of the project are commensurate with costs, and that the project is cost-effective;

(vi) Comply, in accordance with section 601(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WRDA 2000, with applicable water quality standards and applicable water quality permitting requirements;

(vii) Identify, in accordance with § 385.35, the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system;

(viii) Identify, in accordance with § 385.35, the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system under State law necessary to implement the provisions in paragraphs (a)(3)(vi) and (vii) of this section;

(ix) Identify the quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available for other water-related needs of the region;

(x) Determine, in accordance with § 385.36, if existing legal sources of water are to be eliminated or transferred;

(xi) Determine, in accordance with § 385.37(b) that implementation of the selected alternative will not reduce levels of service for flood protection that:

(A) Were in existence on the date of enactment of section 601 of WRDA 2000; and

(B) Are in accordance with applicable law; and consider, as appropriate, in accordance with § 385.37(c), opportunities to provide additional flood protection;

(xii) Include an assessment of the monetary and non-monetary benefits and costs, optimization and justification, cost-effectiveness, and engineering feasibility of the project;

(xiii) Include a discussion of any significant changes in cost or scope of the project from that presented in the "Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement," dated April 1, 1999;

(xiv) Include an analysis, prepared by RECOVER as described in paragraph (c) of this section, of the project's contributions towards achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan, including, as appropriate, suggestions for improving the performance of the alternative plans;

(xv) Describe how the project contributes to the achievement of interim goals established pursuant to § 385.38 and the interim targets established pursuant to § 385.39;

(xvi) Include, in accordance with § 385.28(c), a draft Project Operating Manual as an appendix; and

(xvii) Include, as appropriate, information necessary for the non-Federal sponsor to address the requirements of Chapter 373 of the Florida Statutes, and other applicable planning and reporting requirements of Florida law.

(4) The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall develop the Project Implementation Report generally in accordance with the process shown in figure 2 in Appendix A of this part.

(5) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall develop a guidance memorandum in accordance with § 385.5 for approval by the Secretary of the Army, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor, that describes the major tasks that are generally needed to prepare a Project Implementation Report and the format and content of a Project Implementation Report.
