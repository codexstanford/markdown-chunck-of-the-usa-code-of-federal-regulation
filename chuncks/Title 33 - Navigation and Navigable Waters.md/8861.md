###### Request for retention of temporary flood control works.

(e)Local interests may ask to retain a temporary structure for protection from future floods. This will not be approved by the Corps unless the works are upgraded to meet all Corps criteria for permanent projects. Public Law 84-99 funds will not be used to upgrade the structure. An upgraded project must comply with permitting, environmental, and other regulatory and legal requirements. Unless upgraded, such projects are not eligible for rehabilitation, and must be removed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Unless upgraded, temporary projects which are not removed by the local sponsor will cause all projects with the same sponsor to lose eligibility for Public Law 84-99 assistance. Local interests must initiate action to upgrade or remove the temporary works within 30 days after the flood threat has passed.
