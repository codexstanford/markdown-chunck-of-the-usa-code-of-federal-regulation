###### Advice and reporting.

(b)Information on the results of CEI inspections will be furnished in writing to non-Federal sponsors, and will be maintained in Corps district offices. Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that a CEI rating of Unacceptable will cause the flood control work to be placed in an Inactive status, and not eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance. Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that maintenance deficiencies found during CEI's may negatively impact on eligibility of future Rehabilitation Assistance, and the degree of local cost-sharing participation in any proposed work. Follow-up inspections can be made by the Corps to monitor progress in correcting deficiencies when warranted.
