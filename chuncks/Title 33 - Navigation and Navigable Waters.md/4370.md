######## Clean ballast

means the ballast in a tank which, since oil was last carried therein, has been so cleaned that effluent therefrom, if it were discharged from a ship that is stationary into clean calm water on a clear day would not produce visible traces of oil on the surface of the water or adjoining shorelines or cause a sludge or emulsion to be deposited beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shorelines. If the ballast is discharged through an oil discharge monitoring and control system approved by the government of the country under whose authority the ship is operating, evidence based on such a system, to the effect that the oil content of the effluent does not exceed 15 parts per million (ppm) is determinative that the ballast is clean.
