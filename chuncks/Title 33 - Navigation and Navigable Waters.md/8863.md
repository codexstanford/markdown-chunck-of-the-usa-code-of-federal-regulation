###### Maintenance deficiencies.

(a)Rehabilitation, Emergency Water, Post Flood Response, and Advance Measures authorities may not be used to correct deferred or deficient maintenance. Such correction must be accomplished by, or at the expense of, local interests. This may include restoring normal levee or dune height after subsidence, replacement of deteriorated components such as outlet structures and pipes, removal of debris, and new construction items such as protection against erosion. This restriction on use of these authorities does not preclude furnishing flood fight assistance during an emergency.
