(g) The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470) created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to advise the President and Congress on matters involving historic preservation. In performing its function the Council is authorized to review and comment upon activities licensed by the Federal Government which will have an effect upon properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or eligible for such listing. The concern of Congress for the preservation of significant historical sites is also expressed in the Preservation of Historical and Archeological Data Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 469), which amends the Act of June 27, 1960. By this Act, whenever a federal construction project or federally licensed project, activity, or program alters any terrain such that significant historical or archeological data is threatened, the Secretary of the Interior may take action necessary to recover and preserve the data prior to the commencement of the project.
