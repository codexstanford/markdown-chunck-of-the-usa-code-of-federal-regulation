### PART 329 - DEFINITION OF NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
#### ยง 329.12 Geographic and jurisdictional limits of oceanic and tidal waters.
##### Bays and estuaries.

(b)Regulatory jurisdiction extends to the entire surface and bed of all waterbodies subject to tidal action. Jurisdiction thus extends to the edge (as determined by paragraph (a)(2) of this section) of all such waterbodies, even though portions of the waterbody may be extremely shallow, or obstructed by shoals, vegetation, or other barriers. Marshlands and similar areas are thus considered "navigable in law," but only so far as the area is subject to inundation by the mean high waters. The relevant test is therefore the presence of the mean high tidal waters, and not the general test described above, which generally applies to inland rivers and lakes.
