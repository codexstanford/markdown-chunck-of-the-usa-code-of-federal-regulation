(h)(1) The passage of bag or sack rafts, or of loose logs, into or through the canal is prohibited.

(3) Rafts shall not be of greater dimensions, either way, than 50 feet wide by 600 feet long, and if longer than 300 feet shall be handled by two tugs.

(4) No raft shall pass through the canal, unless by special permission of the superintendent or his authorized assistants, who will direct a time for passing that will least interfere with other navigation.

They shall keep careful watch when passing aids to navigation, and should any be accidentally displaced, shall report the fact at the earliest possible moment to the superintendent or his authorized assistants.
