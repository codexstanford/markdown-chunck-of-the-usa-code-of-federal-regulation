#### ยง 222.2 Acquisition of lands downstream from spillways for hydrologic safety purposes.
##### Development within floodway.

(4)If development within the floodway downstream from a spillway is not present at the time of project construction, the existence of the reservoir may encourage development. Adverse terrain conditions do not preclude development. Sparse present development is not a basis for lack of real estate acquisition.
