(h) The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (15 U.S.C. 1701) prohibits any developer or agent from selling or leasing any lot in a subdivision (as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1701(3)) unless the purchaser is furnished in advance a printed property report containing information which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, by rules or regulations, require for the protection of purchasers. In the event the lot in question is part of a project that requires DA authorization, the property report is required by Housing and Urban Development regulation to state whether or not a permit for the development has been applied for, issued, or denied by the Corps of Engineers under section 10 or section 404. The property report is also required to state whether or not any enforcement action has been taken as a consequence of non-application for or denial of such permit.
