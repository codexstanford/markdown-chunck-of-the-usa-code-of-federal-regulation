## Chapter II - Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, Department of Defense
### PART 329 - DEFINITION OF NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
#### ยง 329.9 Time at which commerce exists or determination is made.
##### Future or potential use.

(b)Navigability may also be found in a waterbody's susceptibility for use in its ordinary condition or by reasonable improvement to transport interstate commerce. This may be either in its natural or improved condition, and may thus be existent although there has been no actual use to date. Non-use in the past therefore does not prevent recognition of the potential for future use.
