#### ยง 207.750 Puget Sound Area, Wash.
##### Rafts.

(8)(i) No log raft exceeding 700 feet in length or 76 feet in width shall pass through the canal. Boom sticks shall be smooth, with rounded ends, and securely tied together with cables, chains, or log swifters to prevent the raft from spreading while in the lock. Rafts containing logs that do not float above water for their entire length, or are in danger of being submerged when they enter fresh water, shall not be towed in the canal until such logs are securely fastened so as to prevent their escape from the raft.

(ii) Whenever required, log rafts passing in through the lock will be given a number that shall be fastened on one of the logs in the raft. This number will identify the raft and shall not be removed until the logs are used.

(iii) Two floats are maintained in Shilshole Bay near the entrance of the canal channel to facilitate the handling of logs in the canal. Rafts bound for the canal may be moored at one of these floats, only the portion of the raft that is to be taken through at a single lockage being brought into the canal. The remainder of the raft may be left at the float until the first portion has been towed to its destination above the lock.
