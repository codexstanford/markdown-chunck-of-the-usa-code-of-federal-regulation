Prior to, during, or immediately following flood or coastal storm activity, emergency operations may be undertaken to supplement State and local activities. Corps assistance is limited to the preservation of life and property,residential/commercial/industrial developments, and public facilities/services. Direct assistance to individual homeowners, individual property owners, or businesses is not permitted. Assistance will be temporary to meet the immediate threat, and is not intended to provide permanent solutions. All Corps activities will be coordinated with the State Emergency Management Agency or equivalent. Reimbursement of State or local emergency costs is not authorized. The local assurances required for the provision of Corps assistance apply only to the work performed under Public Law 84-99, and will not prevent State or local governments from receiving other Federal assistance for which they are eligible.
