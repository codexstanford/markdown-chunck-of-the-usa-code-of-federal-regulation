#### ยง 207.50 Hudson River Lock at Troy, N.Y.; navigation.
##### Precedence at the lock.

(d)The vessel arriving first at the lock shall be first to lock through; but precedence shall be given to vessels belonging to the United States and to commercial vessels in the order named. Arrival posts or markers may be established ashore above or below the lock. Vessels arriving at or opposite such posts or markers will be considered as having arrived at the lock within the meaning of this paragraph. If the traffic is crowded in both directions; up and down lockages will usually be made alternately, but the lock tender may permit two or more lockages to be made at one time in the same direction when this will not cause unreasonable delay. In case two or more boats or tows are to enter for the same lockage, they shall enter as directed by the lock tender. No boat shall run ahead of another while in the lock. The boat that enters first shall leave first.
