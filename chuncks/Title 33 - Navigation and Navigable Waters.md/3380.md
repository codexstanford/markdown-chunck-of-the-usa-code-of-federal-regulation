####### ยง 127.1205 Emergency shutdown.

(a) Each piping system used to transfer LHG or its vapors to or from a vessel must have a quick-closing shutoff valve to stop the flow of liquid and vapor from the waterfront facility handling LHG if a transfer hose or loading arm fails. This valve may be the isolation valve with a bleed connection required by ยง 127.1101(c).

(b) The valve required by paragraph (a) of this section must be located as near as practicable to the terminal manifold or loading-arm connection and must-

(1) Close on loss of power;

(2) Close from the time of activation in 30 seconds or less;

(3) Be capable of local manual closing and remotely controlled closing; and,

(4) If the piping system is used to transfer a flammable LHG, either have fusible elements that melt at less than 105 &#xB0;C (221 &#xB0;F) and activate the emergency shutdown, or have a sensor that performs the same function.

(c) A remote actuator for each valve must be located in a place accessible in an emergency, at least 15 meters (49.2 feet) from the terminal manifold or loading arm, and conspicuously marked with its designated function. When activated, the actuator must also automatically shut down any terminal pumps or compressors used to transfer LHG, or its vapors, to or from the vessel.
