###### General policy.

(b)(1) It is a non-Federal responsibility for providing an adequate supply of water to local inhabitants. Corps assistance to provide emergency water supplies will only be considered when non-Federal interests have exhausted reasonable means for securing necessary water supplies, including assistance and support from other Federal agencies.

(2) Before Corps assistance is considered under this authority, the applicability of other Federal assistance authorities must be evaluated. If these programs cannot provide the needed assistance, then maximum coordination should be made with appropriate agencies in implementing Corps assistance.
