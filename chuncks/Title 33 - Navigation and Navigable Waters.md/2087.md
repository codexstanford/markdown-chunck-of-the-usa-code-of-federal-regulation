This area is also to be used for quarantine anchorage. Vessels must be so anchored in this area as to leave at all times an open usable channel at least 100 feet wide for passage of ferry and other boats between Portland, Peak Island, and Bay Points. Any vessels anchored in this area shall be ready to move on short notice when ordered to do so by the Captain of the Port.

(2) Anchorage C is intended for use only by small vessels and for temporary anchorage.
