####### Transom

means the surface at the stern of a boat projecting or facing aft. The upper boundary of the transom is the line defined by a series of points of contact, with the boat structure, by straight lines at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical longitudinal plane and which are brought into contact with the stern of the horizontal boat. A boat is horizontal when it is transversely level and when the lowest points at 40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's length behind the most forward point of the boat are level.
