###### Loading Assumptions.

2.For the purpose of calculating subdivision and damage stability for a tank vessel, the operating drafts must reflect actual partial or full load conditions consistent with trim and strength of the vessel. Ballast conditions need not be considered if the tank vessel is not carrying oil in cargo tanks excluding oily residues. Loading condition must reflect the specific gravities of the cargo.
