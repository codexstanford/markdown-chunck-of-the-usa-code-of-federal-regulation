###### Active status.

(c)In order for a flood control work to be eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance, it must be in an Active status at the time of damage from a flood or coastal storm event. To gain an Active status, a non-Federal flood control work must meet certain engineering, maintenance, and qualification criteria, as determined by the Corps during an Initial Eligibility Inspection (IEI). To retain an Active status, Federal and non-Federal flood control works must continue to meet inspection criteria set by the Corps, as determined by the Corps during a Continuing Eligibility Inspection (CEI). All flood control works not in an Active status are considered to be Inactive, regardless of whether or not they have previously received a Corps inspection, or Corps assistance.
