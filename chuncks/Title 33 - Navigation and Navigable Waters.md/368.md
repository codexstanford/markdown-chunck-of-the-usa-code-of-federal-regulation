(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no judgment of conviction by a State court is conclusive in any S&R proceeding under this part concerning any act or offense described in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704, even when an act or offense forming the basis of the charge in the proceeding is the same as in the State conviction. But the judgment is admissible in evidence and constitutes substantial evidence adverse to the respondent.
