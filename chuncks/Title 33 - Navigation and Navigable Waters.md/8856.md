##### ยง 203.82 Requirements of local cooperation.

It is Corps policy that provision of assistance under Public Law 84-99 will, insofar as feasible, require local interests to: provide without cost to the United States all LERRD's necessary for the authorized work; hold and save the United States free from damages due to the authorized work, exclusive of damages due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its contractor; maintain and operate, in a manner satisfactory to the Chief of Engineers, all the works after completion. When assistance includes the construction of temporary protective works, the maintain and operate clause is modified by adding (or substituting, as applicable) the requirement for local interests to remove any temporary works constructed by the Corps under Public Law 84-99. If any permanent works are constructed, then the sponsor is required to operate and maintain the project in accordance with requirements determined by the Corps.
