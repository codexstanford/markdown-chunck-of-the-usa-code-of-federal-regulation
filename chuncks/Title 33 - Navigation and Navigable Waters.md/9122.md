### PART 207 - NAVIGATION REGULATIONS
#### ยง 207.300 Ohio River, Mississippi River above Cairo, Ill., and their tributaries; use, administration, and navigation.
##### Buoys at movable dams.

(x)(1) Whenever the river (guard) wall of the lock and any portion of the dam are awash, and until covered by a depth of water equal to the project depth, the limits of the navigable pass through the dam will be marked by buoys located at the upstream and downstream ends of the river (guard) wall, and by a single buoy over the end or ends of the portion or portions of the dam adjacent to the navigable pass over which project depth is not available. A red nun-type buoy will be used for such structures located on the left-hand side (facing downstream) of the river and a black can-type buoy for such structures located on the right-hand side. Buoys will be lighted, if practicable.

(2) Where powerhouses or other substantial structures projecting considerably above the level of the lock wall are located on the river (guard) wall, a single red light located on top of one of these structures may be used instead of river wall buoys prescribed above until these structures are awash, after which they will be marked by a buoy of appropriate type and color (red nun or black can buoy) until covered by a depth of water equal to the project depth. Buoys will be lighted, if practicable.
