(d) Additional consideration for high cost projects. For any project where the normal non-Federal share exceeds 35 percent, and the per capita non-Federal cost (, normal non-Federal share of total construction costs divided by the population in the sponsor's geographic jurisdiction) exceeds $300, the non-Federal share under the ability to pay provision will be either LERRD's (, no cash requirement) or 35 percent, whichever is greater. If LERRD's exceed 50 percent, the non-Federal share remains at 50 percent. Projects which qualify under the benefits and income tests will receive the reduction under the high cost criteria only if the high cost criteria results in a greater reduction in the non-Federal cost share.
