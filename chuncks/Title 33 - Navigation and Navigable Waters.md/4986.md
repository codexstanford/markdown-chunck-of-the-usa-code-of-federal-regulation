means a discharge of oil on the deck of a vessel during loading, unloading, transfer, or other shipboard operations. An on-deck spill could result from a leaking fitting, an overfill, a bad connection, or similar operational mishap. The termis used to differentiate these operational discharges from those caused by collision or grounding where the hull is punctured and a tank is ruptured, resulting in an uncontrolled discharge of oil into the marine environment.
