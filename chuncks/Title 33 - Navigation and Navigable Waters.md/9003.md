### PART 207 - NAVIGATION REGULATIONS
#### ยง 207.180 All waterways tributary to the Gulf of Mexico (except the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South and Southwest Passes and the Atchafalaya River) from St. Marks, Fla., to the Rio Grande; use, administration, and navigation.
##### Precedence at locks.

(6)The order of precedence for locking is:

(i) U.S. Government vessels, passenger vessels, commercial vessels, rafts, and pleasure craft.

(ii) The vessel arriving first at a lock will be locked through first. When vessels approach simultaneously from opposite directions, the vessel approaching at the same elevation as the water in the lock chamber will be locked through first. In order to achieve the most efficient utilization of the lock, the lockmaster is authorized to depart from the normal order of locking precedence, stated in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, as in his judgment is warranted.

(iii) The lockage of pleasure boats, houseboats, or like craft may be expedited by locking them through with commercial craft (other than vessels carrying dangerous cargoes, as described in 46 CFR part 146). If, after the arrival of such craft, no combined lockage can be made within reasonable time, not to exceed three other lockages, then separate lockage shall be made.
