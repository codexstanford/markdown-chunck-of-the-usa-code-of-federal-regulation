##### Division Review.

b.After review, the division commander will issue a public notice of report issuance and transmit the report to the CEBRH. On Mississippi River and Tributaries projects, the district commander will issue a public notice and submit the report to the CEMRC. For the purpose of this regulation, only the acronym CEBRH will be used since the review functions of CEMRC and CEBRH are similar. The notice will provide a 30-day period for comments to be submitted to CEBRH on the report and EIS. Although the EIS in the report is identified as "final" at this stage of processing, it should be made clear to all those requesting a copy that it is an "Interim Document under Agency Review-Subject to Revision" and will become the agency's final EIS when it is filed after CEBRH review.
