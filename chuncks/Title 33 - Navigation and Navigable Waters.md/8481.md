####### Sheer

means the topmost line in a boat's side. The sheer intersects the vertical centerline plane of the boat at the forward end and intersects the transom (stern) at the aft end. For the purposes of this definition, the topmost line in a boat's side is the line defined by a series of points of contact with the boat structure, by straight lines at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical plane normal to the outside edge of the boat as seen from above and which are brought into contact with the outside of the horizontal boat. A boat is horizontal when it is transversely level and when the lowest points at 40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's length behind the most forward point of the boat are level.
