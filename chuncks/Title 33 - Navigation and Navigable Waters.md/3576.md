###### ยง 138.100 How to calculate a total applicable amount.
####### OPA 90 and CERCLA applicable amounts and limits of liability.

(d)The responsible parties are strictly, jointly and severally liable, for the costs and damages resulting from an incident or a release, but together they need only establish and maintain an amount of financial responsibility equal to the single limit of liability per incident or release. Only that portion of the evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart with respect to-

(1) OPA 90 is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to an incident where there is not also a release; and

(2) CERCLA is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to a release where there is not also an incident. A guarantor (or a self-insurer for whom the exceptions to a limitations of liability are not applicable), therefore, is not required to apply the entire amount of financial responsibility to an incident involving oil alone or a release involving a hazardous substance alone.
