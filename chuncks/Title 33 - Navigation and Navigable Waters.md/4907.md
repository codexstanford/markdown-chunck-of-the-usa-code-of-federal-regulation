###### Certification, Recertification, and Operational Review
####### ยง 154.2022 Certification, recertification, or operational review - certifying entity responsibilities, generally.

Before the initial certification of a facility vapor control system (VCS), the certifying entity must perform each of the tasks specified in this section.

(a) Review all VCS design documentation, including plans, drawings, calculations, specifications, and failure analysis, to ensure that the VCS design meets the requirements of this subpart.

(b) Conduct an initial onsite inspection to ensure that the VCS installation conforms to the VCS plans, drawings, and specifications reviewed.

(c) Conduct onsite reviews and observe tests to ensure the VCS's proper operation in accordance with its design and compliance with applicable regulations and the facility's operations manual and to ensure that-

(1) Each alarm and shutdown shown on the piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) and reviewed in the hazard analysis as part of the system responds properly, through simulation of emergency conditions to activate the alarm or shutdown;

(2) Maximum vacuum cannot be exceeded at the maximum operating conditions of any vapor-moving device, through testing of the vacuum breaker;

(3) VCS shutdown occurs correctly, through the startup of the VCS and tripping of each shutdown loop while the VCS is not connected to a vessel;

(4) VCS startup, normal operation, and shutdown occur properly, through observing the relevant portions of a test loading or unloading of one vessel, or a test cleaning of one tank barge at a tank barge cleaning facility; and that

(5) The automatic liquid block valve successfully stops flow of liquid to the vessel during a system shutdown, through observing the relevant portions of a test loading or test cargo tank cleaning.

(d) Review, for each cargo vapor the VCS will control, the cargo's chemical data and the VCS design to ensure that-

(1) Each vapor-controlled chemical is either specified in writing by the Commandant or listed in 46 CFR 30.25-1, 46 CFR 151.05, or Table 1 or Table 2 of 46 CFR 153;
