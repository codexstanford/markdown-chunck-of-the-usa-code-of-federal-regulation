4.

4.1 Î” P/P-The dimensionless ratio, for any deflagration and detonation test of 14.3, of the maximum pressure increase (the maximum pressure minus the initial pressure), as measured in the piping system on the side of the arrester where ignition begins by the device described in paragraph 14.3.3, to the initial absolute pressure in the piping system. The initial pressure should be greater than or equal to the maximum operating pressure specified in paragraph 11.1.7.

4.2 Deflagration-A combustion wave that propagates subsonically (as measured at the pressure and temperature of the flame front) by the transfer of heat and active chemical species to the unburned gas ahead of the flame front.

4.3 Detonation-A reaction in a combustion wave propagating at sonic or supersonic (as measured at the pressure and temperature of the flame front) velocity. A detonation is stable when it has a velocity equal to the speed of sound in the burnt gas or may be unstable (overdriven) with a higher velocity and pressure.

4.4 Detonation flame arrester-A device which prevents the transmission of a detonation and a deflagration.

4.5 Flame speed-The speed at which a flame propagates along a pipe or other system.

4.6 Flame Passage-The transmission of a flame through a device.

4.7 Gasoline Vapors-A non-leaded petroleum distillate consisting essentially of aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds with a boiling range approximating 65 &#xB0;C/75 &#xB0;C.
