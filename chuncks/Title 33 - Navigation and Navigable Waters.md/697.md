###### ยง 67.15-1 Lights and signals on attendant vessels.

The requirements prescribed by this part apply to structures. The barges, vessels, and other miscellaneous floating plants in attendance must display lights and signals under the International Navigational Rules Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. 1601-1608) that adopted the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), or the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. 2001-2038). When vessels are fixed to or submerged onto the seabed, however, they become structures as described in ยง 67.01-5.
