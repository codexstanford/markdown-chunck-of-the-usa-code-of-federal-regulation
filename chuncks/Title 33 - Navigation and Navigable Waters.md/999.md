## Chapter I - Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security
### Subchapter E - Inland Navigation Rules
#### PART 89 - INLAND NAVIGATION RULES: IMPLEMENTING RULES
##### Subpart A - Certificate of Alternative Compliance
###### § 89.3 General.

Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of the Inland Rules without interfering with their special function may instead meet alternative requirements. The Chief of the Prevention Division in each Coast Guard District Office makes this determination and requires that alternative compliance be as close as possible with the Inland Rules. These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be certified for alternative compliance. The information collection and recordkeeping requirements in §§ 89.5 and 89.18 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control No. 1625-0019.
