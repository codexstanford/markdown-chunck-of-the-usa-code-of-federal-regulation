####### Reporting requirements for self-insurers and financial guarantors.

(e)(1) Each self-insurer and financial guarantor must submit the following reports to the Director with the Application and annually thereafter, within the deadlines specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section:

(i) Submit the self-insurer or financial guarantor's annual, current, and audited non-consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and audited by an independent Certified Public Accountant in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.

(ii) Accompany the financial statements with a declaration from the self-insurer or financial guarantor's chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official, certifying the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets, and the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total assets included in the accompanying balance sheet, which are located in the United States.

(iii) If the financial statements cannot be submitted in non-consolidated form, submit a consolidated statement accompanied by an additional declaration prepared by the same Certified Public Accountant-

(A) Verifying the amount by which the total assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) liabilities, and the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) current liabilities;

(B) Specifically naming the self-insurer or financial guarantor;

(C) Confirming that the amounts so verified relate only to the self-insurer or financial guarantor, apart from any parent or other affiliated entity; and

(D) Identifying the consolidated financial statement to which it applies.

(2) When the self-insurer or financial guarantor's demonstrated net worth is not at least ten times the cumulative total applicable amounts, their chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official must submit to the Director with the Application and semi-annually thereafter, within the deadline specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, an affidavit stating that neither their working capital nor net worth fell during the first 6 months of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current fiscal year, below the cumulative total applicable amounts.

(3) All self-insurers and financial guarantors must-

(i) Submit, upon the Director's request, additional financial information within the time specified; and

(ii) Notify the Director in writing within 5 days following the date the self-insurer or financial guarantor knows, or has reason to know, that its working capital or net worth has fallen below the total applicable amounts.

(4) All required annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 90 days after the close of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's fiscal year. All required semi-annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 30 days after the close of the applicable 6-month period. The Director will grant an extension of the time limits for submissions under this paragraph only as provided in ยง 138.60(e).

(5) A failure by a self-insurer or financial guarantor to timely submit to the Director any statement, data, notification, or other submission required may result in the Director denying or revoking the COFR, and may prompt enforcement action as provided under ยง 138.170.

(6) The Director may waive the working capital requirement for any self-insurer or financial guarantor that-

(i) Is a regulated public utility, a municipal or higher-level governmental entity, or an entity operating solely as a charitable, non-profit organization qualifying under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)), provided that the self-insurer or financial guarantor demonstrates in writing that the waiver would benefit a local public interest; or

(ii) Demonstrates in writing that working capital is not a significant factor in the self-insurer or financial guarantor's financial condition, in which case the self-insurer or financial guarantor's net worth in relation to the required cumulative total applicable amounts, and a history of stable operations, are the major elements considered by the Director.
