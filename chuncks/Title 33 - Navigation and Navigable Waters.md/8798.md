###### Policies.

(b)(1) Rehabilitation of HSPP's is limited to the repair/restoration of the HSPP to a pre-storm condition that allows for the adequate functioning of the project, provided that the damage was caused by an extraordinary storm.

(2) To be eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance, HSPP's must be:

(i) A completed element of a Federally authorized project; or,

(ii) A portion of a Federally authorized project constructed by non-Federal interests when approval of such construction was obtained from the Commander, Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (HQUSACE), or his designated representative; or,

(iii) A portion of a Federally authorized project constructed by non-Federal interests and designated by an Act of Congress as a Federal project; and

(3) Rehabilitation Assistance for sacrificial features will be limited to that necessary to reduce the immediate threat to life and property, or restoration to pre-storm conditions, whichever is less.

(4) To be eligible for rehabilitation, the sacrificial features of an HSPP must be substantially eroded by wind, wave, or water action of an other than ordinary nature. The determination of whether a storm qualifies as extraordinary will be made by the Director of Civil Works, and may be delegated to the Chief, Operations Division, Directorate of Civil Works.

(5) Rehabilitation will not be provided for uncompleted HSPP's. An HSPP (or separable portion thereof) is considered completed when transferred to the non-Federal sponsor for operation and maintenance.
