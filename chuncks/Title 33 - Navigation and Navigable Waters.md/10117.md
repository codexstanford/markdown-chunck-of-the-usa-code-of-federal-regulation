### PART 329 - DEFINITION OF NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
#### ยง 329.11 Geographic and jurisdictional limits of rivers and lakes.
##### Upper limit of navigability.

(b)The character of a river will, at some point along its length, change from navigable to non-navigable. Very often that point will be at a major fall or rapids, or other place where there is a marked decrease in the navigable capacity of the river. The upper limit will therefore often be the same point traditionally recognized as the head of navigation, but may, under some of the tests described above, be at some point yet farther upstream.
