##### Entering locks.

(iv)Masters of vessels shall exercise the greatest care when entering either lock. The forward movement of vessels while taking position in the locks shall be very slow, and boats entering the small lock shall reduce their speed to not more than two and one-half miles per hour when within 200 feet of the outer gate and come to practically a full stop before entering the lock so that in case the engine mechanism fails to operate properly the momentum of the boat may be stopped easily by its lines. The masters of vessels entering either lock from either direction shall be alert to receive and shall immediately comply with instructions by voice or signal from the lock attendants.
