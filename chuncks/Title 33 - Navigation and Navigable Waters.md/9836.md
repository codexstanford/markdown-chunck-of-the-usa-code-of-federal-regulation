(i) The Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531) declares the intention of the Congress to conserve threatened and endangered species and the ecosystems on which those species depend. The Act requires that federal agencies, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, use their authorities in furtherance of its purposes by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered or threatened species, and by taking such action necessary to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by the Agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, as appropriate, to be critical. (See 50 CFR part 17 and 50 CFR part 402.)
