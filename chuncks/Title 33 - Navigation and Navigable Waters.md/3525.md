####### Financial guarantor

is a type of guarantor and means a business entity or other person providing a financial guaranty under ยง 138.110(c). A financial guarantor is distinct from a COFR insurance guarantor, a self-insurer, or a surety. A self-insurer, however, may also serve as a financial guarantor for others.
