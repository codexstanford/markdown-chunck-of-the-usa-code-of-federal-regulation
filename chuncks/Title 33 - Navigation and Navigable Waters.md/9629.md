#### ยง 222.5 Water control management (ER 1110-2-240).
##### Directives and technical instruction manuals.

(h)(1) Directives issued through OCE Engineer Regulations will be used to foster consistency in policies and basic practices. They will be supplemented as needed by other forms of communication.

(2) Engineering Manuals (EM) and Engineer Technical Letters (ETL) are issued by OCE to serve as general guidelines and technical aids in developing water control plans and manuals for individual projects or systems.

(3) EM 1110-2-3600 discusses principles and concepts involved in developing water control plans. Instructions relating to preparation of "Water Control Manuals for specific projects" are included. EM 1110-2-3600 should be used as a general guide to water control activities. The instructions are sufficiently flexible to permit adaptation to specific regions. Supplemental information regarding technical methods is provided in numerous documents distributed to field offices as "hydrologic references."

(4) Special assistance in technical studies is available from the Hydrologic Engineering Center, Corps of Engineers, 609 Second Street, Davis, California 95616 and DAEN-CWE-HW.
