(b) If a void space or segregated ballast tank of a length less thanis located between wing oil tanks,in formula I of this section may be calculated on the basis of volumebeing the actual volume of one such tank (where they are of equal capacity) or the smaller of the two tanks (if they differ in capacity), adjacent to such space, multiplied byas defined below and taking for all other wing tanks involved in such a collision the value of the actual full volume.

(c) Credit is only given in respect to double bottom tanks which are either empty or carrying clean water when cargo is carried in the tanks above.

(1) If the double bottom does not extend for the full length and width of the tank involved, the double bottom is considered nonexistent and the volume of the tanks above the area of the bottom damage must be included in formula II of this section even if the tank is not considered breached because of the installation of such a partial double bottom.
