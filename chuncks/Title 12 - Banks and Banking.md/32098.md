(E)A federally insured credit union that acquires all of the insured shares of another federally insured credit union in the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution shall receive an amount equivalent to what the acquiring federally insured credit union and the selling federally insured credit union would have received but for the consummation of the purchase and assumption transaction provided that the selling federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution. For purposes of calculating the acquiring federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, any insured shares previously reported during that calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution by the selling federally insured credit union on its quarterly Call Reports filed prior to the consummation of the purchase and assumption transaction shall be combined with the insured shares reported on the acquiring federally insured credit union's quarterly Call Reports.
