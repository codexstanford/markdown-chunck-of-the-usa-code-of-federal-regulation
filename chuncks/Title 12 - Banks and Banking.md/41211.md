##### Substantially similar rate when LIBOR becomes unavailable.

3.Under § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(A), the replacement index and replacement margin must produce an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate that was in effect based on the LIBOR index used under the plan when the LIBOR index became unavailable. For this comparison of the rates, a creditor generally must use the value of the replacement index and the LIBOR index on the day that LIBOR becomes unavailable. If the replacement index is not published on the day that the LIBOR index becomes unavailable, the creditor generally must use the previous calendar day that both indices are published as the date for selecting indices values in determining whether the annual percentage rate based on the replacement index is substantially similar to the rate based on the LIBOR index. The one exception is that if the replacement index is the spread-adjusted index based on SOFR recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for consumer products to replace the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year U.S. Dollar LIBOR index, the creditor must use the index value on June 30, 2023, for the LIBOR index and, for the SOFR-based spread-adjusted index for consumer products, must use the index value on the first date that index is published, in determining whether the annual percentage rate based on the replacement index is substantially similar to the rate based on the LIBOR index. The replacement index and replacement margin are not required to produce an annual percentage rate that is substantially similar on the day that the replacement index and replacement margin become effective on the plan. For purposes of § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(A), if a creditor uses the SOFR-based spread-adjusted index recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for consumer products to replace the 1-month, 3-month, or 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR index as the replacement index and uses as the replacement margin the same margin that applied to the variable rate immediately prior to the replacement of the LIBOR index used under the plan, the creditor will be deemed to be in compliance with the condition in § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(A) that the replacement index and replacement margin would have resulted in an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate in effect at the time the LIBOR index became unavailable. The following example illustrates this comment.

i. Assume that the 1-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR index used under a plan becomes unavailable on June 30, 2023, and on that day the LIBOR index value is 2%, the margin is 10%, and the annual percentage rate is 12%. Also, assume that a creditor has selected the prime index published in the Wall Street Journal as the replacement index, and the value of the prime index is 5% on June 30, 2023. The creditor would satisfy the requirement to use a replacement index and replacement margin that will produce an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate that was in effect when the LIBOR index used under the plan became unavailable by selecting a 7% replacement margin. (The prime index value of 5% and the replacement margin of 7% would produce a rate of 12% on June 30, 2023.) Thus, if the creditor provides a change-in-terms notice under § 1026.9(c)(1) on July 1, 2023, disclosing the prime index as the replacement index and a replacement margin of 7%, where these changes will become effective on July 17, 2023, the creditor satisfies the requirement to use a replacement index and replacement margin that will produce an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate that was in effect when the LIBOR index used under the plan became unavailable. This is true even if the prime index value changes after June 30, 2023, and the annual percentage rate calculated using the prime index value and 7% margin on July 17, 2022, is not substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR index value on June 30, 2023.
