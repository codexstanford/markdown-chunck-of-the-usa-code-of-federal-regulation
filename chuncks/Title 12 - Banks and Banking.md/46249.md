##### § 1253.4 New product approval.
###### Temporary approval.

(c)(1) FHFA may approve a new product without first seeking public comments as described in § 1253.4(c) if-

(i) The Enterprise submits a specific request for Temporary Approval that describes the exigent circumstances that make the delay associated with the 30-day public comment period contrary to the public interest and the Director determines that exigent circumstances exist and that delay associated with first seeking public comment would be contrary to the public interest; or

(ii) Notwithstanding the absence of a request by the Enterprise for Temporary Approval, the Director determines on his or her own initiative that there are exigent circumstances that make the delay associated with first seeking public comment contrary to the public interest.

(2) The Director may impose terms, conditions, or limitations on the Temporary Approval to ensure that the new product offering is consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory standards, FHFA policies, public interest, and the safety and soundness of the Enterprise or the mortgage finance system.

(3) If the Director grants Temporary Approval, the Director will notify the Enterprise in writing of the Director's decision, and include the period for which it is effective and any terms, conditions or limitations. Upon granting of Temporary Approval, FHFA will also publish the request for public comment to begin the process for permanent approval.

(4) If the Director denies a request for Temporary Approval, the Director will notify the Enterprise in writing of the Director's decision, and will evaluate the new product in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
