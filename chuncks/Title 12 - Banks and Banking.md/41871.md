#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge that applied before increase.

ii.Although § 1026.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge increased pursuant to § 1026.55(b)(4) to the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied prior to the increase, this provision does not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge consistent with any of the other exceptions in § 1026.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the § 1026.55(b)(4) increase and the temporary rate expired before a reduction in rate pursuant to § 1026.55(b)(4)(ii), the card issuer may apply an increased rate to the extent consistent with § 1026.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the § 1026.55(b)(4) increase, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate to the extent consistent with § 1026.55(b)(2).
