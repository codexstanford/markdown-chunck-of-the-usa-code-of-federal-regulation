#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Seasonal payment.

v.If a loan product includes a seasonal payment feature, § 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E) requires that the creditor disclose the feature. The feature is not, however, required to be disclosed with any preceding time period. Disclosure of the label "Seasonal Payment" without any preceding number of years satisfies this requirement.
