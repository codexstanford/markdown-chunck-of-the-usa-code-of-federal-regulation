#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Meaning of registration of a prepaid card or prepaid account.

1.A prepaid card or prepaid account is registered, such that the 30-day timing requirement required by § 1026.61(c) begins, when the prepaid account issuer successfully completes its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification in accordance with the requirements of applicable Federal and state law. The beginning of the required 30-day timing requirement is triggered by successful completion of collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification, not by the consumer's mere purchase or obtaining of the card. With respect to a prepaid account for which customer identification and verification are completed before the account is opened, the 30-day timing requirement begins on the day the prepaid account is opened.
