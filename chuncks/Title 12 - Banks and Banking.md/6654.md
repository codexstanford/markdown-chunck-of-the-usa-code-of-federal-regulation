###### Termination coincidental with marital status change.

1.When an account holder's marital status changes, a creditor generally may not terminate the account unless it has evidence that the account holder is now unable or unwilling to repay. But the creditor may terminate an account on which both spouses are jointly liable, even if the action coincides with a change in marital status, when one or both spouses:

i. Repudiate responsibility for future charges on the joint account.

ii. Request separate accounts in their own names.

iii. Request that the joint account be closed.
