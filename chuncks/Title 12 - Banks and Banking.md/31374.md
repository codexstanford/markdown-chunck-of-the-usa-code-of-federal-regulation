###### Fees for overdrawing an account.

6.Under ยง 707.4(b)(4) of this part, credit unions must disclose the conditions under which a fee may be imposed. In satisfying this requirement credit unions must specify the categories of transactions for which an overdraft fee may be imposed. An exhaustive list of transactions is not required. It is sufficient for a credit union to state that the fee applies to overdrafts "created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or other electronic means." Disclosing a fee "for overdraft items" would not be sufficient.
