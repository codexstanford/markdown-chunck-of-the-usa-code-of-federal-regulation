#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Payment due date.

2.Whether a payment is more than 30 days late is measured in relation to the contractual due date not accounting for any grace period. For example, if the contractual due date for a non-standard mortgage payment is the first day of every month, but no late fee will be charged as long as the payment is received by the 16th of the month, the payment due date for purposes of § 1026.43(d)(2)(iv) and (v) is the first day of the month, not the 16th day of the month. Thus, a payment due under the contract on October 1st that is paid on November 1st is made more than 30 days after the payment due date.
