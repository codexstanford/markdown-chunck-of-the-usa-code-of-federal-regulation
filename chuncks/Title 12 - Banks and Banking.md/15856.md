The Connecticut statute applies todeposited in accounts. This term encompasses instruments that are not defined asin Regulation CC (ยง 229.2(k)), such as nonnegotiable instruments, and are therefore not subject to Regulation CC's provisions governing funds availability. Those items that are subject to Connecticut law but are not subject to Regulation CC will continue to be covered by the state availability schedules and exceptions.
