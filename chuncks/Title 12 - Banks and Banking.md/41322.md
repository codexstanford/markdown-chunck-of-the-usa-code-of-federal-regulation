#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Person that prepares valuations.

3.For purposes of § 1026.42, the term "valuation" includes an estimate of value regardless of whether it is an appraisal prepared by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser. See comment 42(b)(3)-1. A person that prepares valuations may or may not be a state-licensed or state-certified appraiser. Thus a person violates § 1026.42(c)(1) by engaging in prohibited acts or practices directed towards any person that prepares or may prepare a valuation of the consumer's principal dwelling for a covered transaction. For example, a person violates § 1026.42(c)(1) by seeking to coerce a real estate agent to assign a value to the consumer's principal dwelling based on a factor other than the independent judgment of the real estate agent, in connection with a covered transaction.
