(f)is an acronym for "generally accepted auditing standards" which refers to the standards approved and adopted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants which apply when an "independent, licensed certified public accountant" audits financial statements. Auditing standards differ from auditing procedures in that "procedures" address acts to be performed, whereas "standards" measure the quality of the performance of those acts and the objectives to be achieved by use of the procedures undertaken. In addition, auditing standards address the auditor's professional qualifications as well as the judgment exercised in performing the audit and in preparing the report of the audit.
