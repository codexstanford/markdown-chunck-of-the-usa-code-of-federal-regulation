6.Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine:

ii. Whether any minimum balance to earn dividends is met. (See commentary to appendix A, Part II, which prohibits credit unions from using negative balances in calculating the dividends figure for the annual percentage yield earned.)
