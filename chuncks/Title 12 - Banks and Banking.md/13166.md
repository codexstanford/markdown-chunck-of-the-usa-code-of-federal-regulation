###### Application fees.

1.An application fee that is excluded from the finance charge is a charge to recover the costs associated with processing applications for credit. The fee may cover the costs of services such as credit reports, credit investigations, and appraisals. The creditor is free to impose the fee in only certain of its loan programs, such as mortgage loans. However, if the fee is to be excluded from the finance charge under ยง 226.4(c)(1), it must be charged to all applicants, not just to applicants who are approved or who actually receive credit.
