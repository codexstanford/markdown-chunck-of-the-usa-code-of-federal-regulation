3.This category includes loans fully secured by first lienson 1- to 4-family residential properties, either owner-occupied or rented, or on multifamily residential properties,that meet certain criteria.Loans included in this category must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards;be performing in accordance with their original terms; and not be 90 days or more past due or carried in nonaccrual status. For purposes of this 50 percent risk weight category, a loan modified on a permanent or trial basis solely pursuant to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Home Affordable Mortgage Program will be considered to be performing in accordance with its original terms. The following additional criteria must also be applied to a loan secured by a multifamily residential property that is included in this category: all principal and interest payments on the loan must have been made on time for at least the year preceding placement in this category, or in the case where the existing property owner is refinancing a loan on that property, all principal and interest payments on the loan being refinanced must have been made on time for at least the year preceding placement in this category; amortization of the principal and interest must occur over a period of not more than 30 years and the minimum original maturity for repayment of principal must not be less than 7 years; and the annual net operating income (before debt service) generated by the property during its most recent fiscal year must not be less than 120 percent of the loan's current annual debt service (115 percent if the loan is based on a floating interest rate) or, in the case of a cooperative or other not-for-profit housing project, the property must generate sufficient cash flow to provide comparable protection to the institution. Also included in this category are privately-issued mortgage-backed securities provided that:

(1) The structure of the security meets the criteria described in section III(B)(3) above;

(2) if the security is backed by a pool of conventional mortgages, on 1- to 4-family residential or multifamily residential properties, each underlying mortgage meets the criteria described above in this section for eligibility for the 50 percent risk category at the time the pool is originated;

(3) If the security is backed by privately-issued mortgage-backed securities, each underlying security qualifies for the 50 percent risk category; and

(4) If the security is backed by a pool of multifamily residential mortgages, principal and interest payments on the security are not 30 days or more past due. Privately-issued mortgage-backed securities that do not meet these criteria or that do not qualify for a lower risk weight are generally assigned to the 100 percent risk category.
