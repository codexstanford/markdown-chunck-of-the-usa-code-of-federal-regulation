##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Memorandum of understanding.

1.Section 226.57(d)(2) requires that the report to the Board include, among other items, a copy of any memorandum of understanding between the card issuer and the institution (or affiliated organization) that "directly or indirectly relates to the college credit card agreement or that controls or directs any obligations or distribution of benefits between any such entities." Such a memorandum of understanding includes any document that amends the college credit card agreement, or that constitutes a further agreement between the parties as to the interpretation or administration of the agreement. For example, a memorandum of understanding required to be included in the report would include a document that provides details on the dollar amounts of payments from the card issuer to the university, to supplement the original agreement which only provided for payments in general terms (e.g., as a percentage). A memorandum of understanding for these purposes would not include email (or other) messages that merely discuss matters such as the addresses to which payments should be sent or the names of contact persons for carrying out the agreement.
