###### Disclosure requirements.

1.Although third parties who give applications to consumers for home equity plans must provide the brochure required under ยง 226.5b(e) in all cases, such persons need provide the disclosures required under ยง 226.5b(d) only in certain instances. A third party has no duty to obtain disclosures about a creditor's home equity plan or to create a set of disclosures based on what it knows about a creditor's plan. If, however, a creditor provides the third party with disclosures along with its application form, the third party must give the disclosures to the consumer with the application form. The duties under this section are those of the third party; the creditor is not responsible for ensuring that a third party complies with those obligations. If an intermediary agent or broker takes an application over the telephone or receives an application contained in a magazine or other publication, footnote 10a permits that person to mail the disclosures and brochure within three business days of receipt of the application. (See the commentary to ยง 226.5b(h) about imposition of nonrefundable fees.)
