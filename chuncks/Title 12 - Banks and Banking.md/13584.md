###### Disclosure of periodic interest rates-whether or not actually applied.

1.Except as provided in ยง 226.7(b)(4)(ii), any periodic interest rate that may be used to compute finance charges, expressed as and labeled "Annual Percentage Rate," must be disclosed whether or not it is applied during the billing cycle. For example

i. If the consumer's account has both a purchase feature and a cash advance feature, the creditor must disclose the annual percentage rate for each, even if the consumer only makes purchases on the account during the billing cycle.

ii. If the annual percentage rate varies (such as when it is tied to a particular index), the creditor must disclose each annual percentage rate in effect during the cycle for which the statement was issued.
