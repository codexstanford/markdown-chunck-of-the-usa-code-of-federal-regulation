The Massachusetts statute governs the availability of funds deposited in "any demand deposit, negotiable order of withdrawal account, savings deposit, share account or other asset account." Regulation CC applies only toas defined in ยง 229.2(a). Regulation CC does not affect the Massachusetts statute to the extent that the state law applies to deposits in savings and other accounts (including transaction accounts where the account holder is a bank, foreign bank, or the U.S. Treasury) that are notunder Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under ยง 229.19(e) of Regulation CC,the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined asunder Regulation CC, in certain circumstances.)
