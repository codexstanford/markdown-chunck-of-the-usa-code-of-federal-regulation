8.Management should perform its own investigation and review of compliance with the Designated Laws and Regulations and, if required, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management should maintain records of its determinations and assessments until the next Federal safety and soundness examination, or such later date as specified by the FDIC or the appropriate Federal banking agency. Management should provide in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, or supplementally, sufficient information to enable the accountant to report on its assertions. The management report of an insured branch of a foreign bank should be signed by the branch's managing official if the branch does not have a chief executive officer or a chief accounting or financial officer.
