1.i. The creditor has 2 alternatives in complying with § 1026.18(c):

A. The creditor may inform the consumer, on the segregated disclosures, that a written itemization of the amount financed will be provided on request, furnishing the itemization only if the customer in fact requests it.

B. The creditor may provide an itemization as a matter of course, without notifying the consumer of the right to receive it or waiting for a request.

ii. Whether given as a matter of course or only on request, the itemization must be provided at the same time as the other disclosures required by § 1026.18, although separate from those disclosures.
