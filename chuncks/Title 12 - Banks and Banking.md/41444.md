#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Obtaining records.

2.To conduct verification under § 1026.43(c)(3) and (4), a creditor may obtain records from a third-party service provider, such as a party the consumer's employer uses to respond to income verification requests, as long as the records are reasonably reliable and specific to the individual consumer. A creditor also may obtain third-party records directly from the consumer, likewise as long as the records are reasonably reliable and specific to the individual consumer. For example, a creditor using payroll statements to verify the consumer's income, as allowed under § 1026.43(c)(4)(iii), may obtain the payroll statements from the consumer.
