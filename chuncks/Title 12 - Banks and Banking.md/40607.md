## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Minimum number of loan options.

2.To obtain the safe harbor, § 1026.36(e)(2) requires that the loan originator present loan options that meet the criteria in § 1026.36(e)(3)(i) for each type of transaction in which the consumer expressed an interest. As required by § 1026.36(e)(3)(ii), the loan originator must have a good faith belief that the options presented are loans for which the consumer likely qualifies. If the loan originator is not able to form such a good faith belief for loan options that meet the criteria in § 1026.36(e)(3)(i) for a given type of transaction, the loan originator may satisfy § 1026.36(e)(2) by presenting all loans for which the consumer likely qualifies and that meet the other requirements in § 1026.36(e)(3) for that given type of transaction. A loan originator may present to the consumer any number of loan options, but presenting a consumer more than four loan options for each type of transaction in which the consumer expressed an interest and for which the consumer likely qualifies would not likely help the consumer make a meaningful choice.
