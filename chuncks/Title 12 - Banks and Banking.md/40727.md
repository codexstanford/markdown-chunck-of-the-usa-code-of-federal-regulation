### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Negative amortization.

2.In a loan that contains a negative amortization feature, periodic principal and interest payments or the range of such payments may change for purposes of § 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) at the time the negative amortization period ends under the terms of the legal obligation, meaning the consumer must begin making payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance. The occurrence of an event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments should be based on the assumption that the consumer will make payments as scheduled or, if applicable, elect to make the periodic payments that would extend the negative amortization period to the latest time permitted under the terms of the legal obligation. The occurrence of all subsequent events requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments should be based on this assumption. The table required by § 1026.37(c) should also reflect any balloon payment that would result from such scheduled payments or election. See § 1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A) for special rules regarding disclosure of balloon payments.
