(a) Fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5) shall be assessed for actual copies of records provided to individuals on the following basis, unless the system manager determining access waives the fee because of the inability of the individual to pay or the cost of collecting the fee exceeds the fee:

(1) For copies of documents provided, copy fees as stated in NCUA's current FOIA fee schedule; and

(2) For copying information, if any, maintained in nondocument form, the direct cost to NCUA may be assessed.

(b) If it is determined that access fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25, and the individual has not indicated in advance willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the individual shall be notified of the amount of the anticipated fees before copies are made, and the individual's access request shall not be considered to have been received until receipt by NCUA of written agreement to pay.
