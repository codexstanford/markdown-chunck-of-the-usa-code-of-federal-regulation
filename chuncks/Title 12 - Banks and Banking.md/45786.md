###### § 1240.33 Single-family mortgage exposures.
####### Credit enhancement multiplier.

(2)(i) The credit enhancement multiplier for a single-family mortgage exposure that is subject to a participation agreement is 1.0.

(ii) Subject to paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the credit enhancement multiplier for-

(A) A performing loan, non-modified RPL, or modified RPL that is subject to non-cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 7 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section;

(B) A performing loan or non-modified RPL that is subject to cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 8 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section;

(C) A modified RPL with a 30-year post-modification amortization that is subject to cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 9 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section;

(D) A modified RPL with a 40-year post-modification amortization that is subject to cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 10 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section; and

(E) NPL, whether subject to non-cancelable mortgage insurance or cancelable mortgage insurance, is set forth on Table 11 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (e), for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section:

(A) The OLTV of a single-family mortgage exposure will be deemed to be 80 percent if the single-family mortgage exposure has an OLTV less than or equal to 80 percent.

(B) If the single-family mortgage exposure has an interest-only feature, any cancelable mortgage insurance will be deemed to be non-cancelable mortgage insurance.

(C) If the coverage percent of the mortgage insurance is greater than charter-level coverage and less than guide-level coverage, the credit enhancement multiplier is the amount equal to a linear interpolation between the credit enhancement multiplier of the single-family mortgage exposure for charter-level coverage and the credit enhancement multiplier of the single-family mortgage exposure for guide-level coverage.

(D) If the coverage percent of the mortgage insurance is less than charter-level coverage, the credit enhancement multiplier is the amount equal to the midpoint of a linear interpolation between a credit enhancement multiplier of 1.0 and the credit enhancement multiplier of the single-family mortgage exposure for charter-level coverage.

(E) If the coverage percent of the mortgage insurance is greater than guide-level coverage, the credit enhancement multiplier is determined as if the coverage percent were guide-level coverage.
