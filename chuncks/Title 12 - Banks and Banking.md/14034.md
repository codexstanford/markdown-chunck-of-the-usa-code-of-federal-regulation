###### Graduated payment adjustable rate mortgages.

12.These mortgages involve both a variable interest rate and scheduled variations in payment amounts during the loan term. For example, under these plans, a series of graduated payments may be scheduled before rate adjustments affect payment amounts, or the initial scheduled payment may remain constant for a set period before rate adjustments affect the payment amount. In any case, the initial payment amount may be insufficient to cover the scheduled interest, causing negative amortization from the outset of the transaction. In these transactions, the disclosures should treat these features as follows:

- The finance charge includes the amount of negative amortization based on the assumption that the rate in effect at consummation remains unchanged.

- The amount financed does not include the amount of negative amortization.

- As in any variable-rate transaction, the annual percentage rate is based on the terms in effect at consummation.

- The schedule of payments discloses the amount of any scheduled initial payments followed by an adjusted level of payments based on the initial interest rate. Since some mortgage plans contain limits on the amount of the payment adjustment, the payment schedule may require several different levels of payments, even with the assumption that the original interest rate does not increase.
