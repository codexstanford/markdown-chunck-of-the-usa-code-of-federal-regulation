If the Relevant IBOR referenced in the Protocol Covered Document is LIBOR with no reference to, or indication of, the currency of the relevant LIBOR (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the reference in Section 7.3 () of the 2005 ISDA Commodity Definitions to "the spot offered rate for deposits in the payment currency in the London interbank market as at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time"), then the reference to LIBOR (howsoever defined or described) in the Protocol Covered Document will be deemed to be a reference to LIBOR in the currency of the related payment for which LIBOR is required pursuant to the terms of the Protocol Covered Document and paragraphs 6(a), 6(d) and 6(e) above, and the related definitions below, shall be construed accordingly.

For the purposes of any Protocol Covered Document which does not include a definition of "Calculation Agent", the term "Calculation Agent" shall be deemed to be a reference to a party or parties who would ordinarily be responsible for calculating or determining any rates or amounts payable under the relevant Protocol Covered Document and performing any associated duties.

If the Protocol Covered Document to which this paragraph 6 applies is a Protocol Covered Master Agreement, the Relevant IBOR is defined in the Protocol Covered Master Agreement and that definition is referenced in a Confirmation that supplements, forms part of and is subject to that Protocol Covered Master Agreement, then the reference in the Protocol Covered Master Agreement to the Relevant IBOR as amended by this paragraph 6 will also apply to the reference to the Relevant IBOR in that Confirmation.

For these purposes:
