###### Discounts for payment by other than credit.

1.The discounts to induce payment by other than credit mentioned in ยง 226.4(b)(9) include, for example, the following situation:

i. The seller of land offers individual tracts for $10,000 each. If the purchaser pays cash, the price is $9,000, but if the purchaser finances the tract with the seller the price is $10,000. The $1,000 difference is a finance charge for those who buy the tracts on credit.
