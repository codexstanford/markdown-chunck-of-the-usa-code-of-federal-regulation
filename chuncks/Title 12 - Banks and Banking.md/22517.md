###### Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures
####### § 324.43 Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) and the gross-up approach.
######## Gross-up approach,Applicability.

(e)-(1)An FDIC-supervised institution that is not subject to subpart F of this part may apply the gross-up approach set forth in this section instead of the SSFA to determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures, provided that it applies the gross-up approach to all of its securitization exposures, except as otherwise provided for certain securitization exposures in §§ 324.44 and 324.45.

(2) To use the gross-up approach, an FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the following four inputs:

(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;

(ii) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization resides;

(iii) Exposure amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure calculated under § 324.42(c); and

(iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this subpart.
