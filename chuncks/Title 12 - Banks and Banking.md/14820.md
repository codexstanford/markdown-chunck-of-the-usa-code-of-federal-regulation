###### Coverage.

1.This subpart applies to all private education loans as defined in § 226.46(b)(5). Coverage under this subpart is optional for certain extensions of credit that do not meet the definition of "private education loan" because the credit is not extended, in whole or in part, for "postsecondary educational expenses" defined in § 226.46(b)(3). If a transaction is not covered and a creditor opts to comply with any section of this subpart, the creditor must comply with all applicable sections of this subpart. If a transaction is not covered and a creditor opts not to comply with this subpart, the creditor must comply with all applicable requirements under §§ 226.17 and 226.18. Compliance with this subpart is optional for an extension of credit for expenses incurred after graduation from a law, medical, dental, veterinary, or other graduate school and related to relocation, study for a bar or other examination, participation in an internship or residency program, or similar purposes. However, if any part of such loan is used for postsecondary educational expenses as defined in § 226.46(b)(3), then compliance with Subpart F is mandatory not optional.
