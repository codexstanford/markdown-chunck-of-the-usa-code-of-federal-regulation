### PART 27 - FAIR HOUSING HOME LOAN DATA SYSTEM
#### ยง 27.2 Definitions.
##### Real estate loan

(i)means any loan secured by real estate where the bank relies upon such real estate as the primary security for the loan. Where the bank in its judgment relies substantially upon other factors, such as the general credit standing of the borrower, guaranties, or security other than real estate, the loan does not constitute a real estate loan, although as a matter of prudent banking practice it may also be secured by real estate.

(1) A loan made in reliance upon the security of a mobile home will not be considered a real estate loan, although as a prudent banking practice the security interest is recorded or otherwise perfected as if the mobile home were real estate. For purposes of this part, a loan made in reliance upon the security of a mobile home and the parcel of land to which it is permanently affixed will be considered a real estate loan.

(2) Where the bank relies substantially on the insurance guaranty of a governmental agency in making a loan, it does not constitute a real estate loan except for the purposes of ยง 27.4 of this part (Inquiry/Application Log).
