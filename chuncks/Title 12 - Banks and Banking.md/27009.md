### PART 403 - CLASSIFICATION, DECLASSIFICATION, AND SAFEGUARDING OF NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION
#### ยง 403.3 Classification principles and authority.
##### Classification Principles.

(a)(1) Except as provided in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Order provides the only basis for classifying national security information. Information held by the Bank will be made available to the public to the extent possible consistent with the need to protect the national defense or foreign relations, as required by the interests of the United States and its citizens. Accordingly, security classification shall be applied only to protect the national security.

(2) Before a classification determination is made, each item of information that may require protection shall be identified exactly. This requires identification of that specific information, disclosure of which could affect the national security. When there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify, the information should be safeguarded as if it were confidential until a final determination is made by an authorized classifier as to its classification. The final determination must be made within thirty (30) days.
