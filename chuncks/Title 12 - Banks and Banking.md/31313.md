###### Examples.

2.Examples include:

i. Food, refreshments, and drawings and raffles at annual meetings, member functions, and branch openings.

ii. Travel club benefits.

iii. Prizes offered at annual meetings, such as U.S. Savings Bonds, a deposit of funds into the winner's account, trips, and other gifts. Such prizes are not bonuses because they are offered as an incentive to increase attendance at the annual meeting, and not to entice members to open, maintain, or renew accounts or increase an account balance.

iv. Life savings benefits.
