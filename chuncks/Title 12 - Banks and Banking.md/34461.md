## Chapter Xâ€”Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection

#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### Charges for error resolution.

3.If a billing error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the financial institution may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error-resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation). Since the Act grants the consumer error-resolution rights, the institution should avoid any chilling effect on the good-faith assertion of errors that might result if charges are assessed when no billing error has occurred.
