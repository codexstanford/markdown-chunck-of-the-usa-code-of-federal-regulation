#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Example.

1.Under § 1026.43(f)(1)(ii), if a qualified mortgage provides for a balloon payment, the creditor must determine that the consumer is able to make all scheduled payments under the legal obligation other than the balloon payment. For example, assume a loan in an amount of $200,000 that has a five-year loan term, but is amortized over 30 years. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 6 percent. The loan consummates on March 3, 2014, and the monthly payment of principal and interest scheduled for the first five years is $1,199, with the first monthly payment due on April 1, 2014. The balloon payment of $187,308 is required on the due date of the 60th monthly payment, which is April 1, 2019. The loan can be a qualified mortgage if the creditor underwrites the loan using the scheduled principal and interest payment of $1,199, plus the consumer's monthly payment for all mortgage-related obligations, and satisfies the other criteria set forth in § 1026.43(f).
