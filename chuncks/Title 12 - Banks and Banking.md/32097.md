(D)A federally insured credit union that merges with a federally insured credit union shall receive an equity distribution equivalent to what the continuing federally insured credit union and the merging federally insured credit union would have received separately but for the consummation of the merger provided that the merging federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board declares the distribution. For purposes of calculating the continuing federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, any insured shares previously reported by the merging federally insured credit union on its quarterly Call Reports filed prior to the consummation of the merger during that calendar year for which the Board declares the distribution shall be combined with the insured shares reported on the continuing federally insured credit union's quarterly Call Reports.
