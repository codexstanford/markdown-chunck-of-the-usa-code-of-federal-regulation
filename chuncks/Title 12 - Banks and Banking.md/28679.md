####### Issuance.

(a)The presiding officer or, in the event he or she is unavailable, the Board may issue subpoenas and subpoena duces tecum at the request of any party requiring the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents at a designated place. The person seeking the subpoena may be required, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. Where it appears to the presiding officer that a subpoena may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or delay the proceeding, the presiding officer has discretion to refuse to issue a subpoena or to issue it only upon such conditions as fairness requires.
