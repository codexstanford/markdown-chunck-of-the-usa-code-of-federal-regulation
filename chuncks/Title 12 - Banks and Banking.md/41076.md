## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Appraised property value.

2.The modifications permitted by § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii) do not specifically refer to the label required by § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B) for transactions that do not involve a seller, because the label is required by that section and therefore is not a modification. As required by § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B), a form used for a transaction that does not involve a seller and is modified under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii) must contain the label "Appraised Prop. Value" or "Estimated Prop. Value" where there is no appraisal.
