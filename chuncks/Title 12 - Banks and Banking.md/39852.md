2.The disclosures required by § 1026.19(a)(1)(i) must be delivered or mailed not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application. The general definition of "business day" in § 1026.2(a)(6)-a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for substantially all of its business functions-is used for purposes of § 1026.19(a)(1)(i).comment 2(a)(6)-1. This general definition is consistent with the definition of "business day" in Regulation X-a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions.12 CFR 1024.2. Accordingly, the three-business-day period in § 1026.19(a)(1)(i) for making early disclosures coincides with the time period within which creditors subject to RESPA must provide good faith estimates of settlement costs. If the creditor does not know the precise credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures on the best information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are estimates under § 1026.17(c)(2). If many of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as "all numerical disclosures except the late-payment disclosure are estimates") instead of separately labeling each estimate. In the alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items primarily affected by unknown information. (the commentary to § 1026.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning the estimates and the contingencies that may affect the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to § 1026.17(a)(1).
