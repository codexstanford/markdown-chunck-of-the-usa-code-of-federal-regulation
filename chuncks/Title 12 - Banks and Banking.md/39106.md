#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Range of balances.

1.The range of balances disclosure is inapplicable:

i. If only one periodic rate may be applied to the entire account balance.

ii. If only one periodic rate may be applied to the entire balance for a feature (for example, cash advances), even though the balance for another feature (purchases) may be subject to two rates (a 1.5% monthly periodic rate on purchase balances of $0-$500, and a 1% monthly periodic rate for balances above $500). In this example, the creditor must give a range of balances disclosure for the purchase feature.
