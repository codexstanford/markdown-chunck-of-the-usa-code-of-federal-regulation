(b)Member banks are subject to the same limitations and conditions with respect to purchasing, selling, underwriting, and holding investment securities and stocks as are national banks under 12 U.S.C. 24, &#xB6; 7th. To determine whether an obligation qualifies as an investment security for the purposes of 12 U.S.C. 24, &#xB6; 7th, and to calculate the limits with respect to the purchase of such obligations, a state member bank may look to part 1 of the rules of the Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR part 1) and interpretations thereunder. A state member bank may consult the Board for a determination with respect to the application of 12 U.S.C. 24, &#xB6; 7th, with respect to issues not addressed in 12 CFR part 1. The provisions of 12 CFR part 1 do not provide authority for a state member bank to purchase securities of a type or amount that the bank is not authorized to purchase under applicable state law.
