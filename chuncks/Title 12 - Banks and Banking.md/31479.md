###### Examples of credit unions advertising the payment of overdrafts.

2.A credit union would trigger the periodic statement disclosures if it:

i. Promotes the credit union's policy or practice of paying some overdrafts, unless the service would be subject to 12 CFR part 1026 (Regulation Z), in advertisements using broadcast media, brochures, telephone solicitations ,or electronic mail, or on Internet sites, ATM screens or receipts, billboards, or indoor signs. But see, Sec. 707.11(a)(2) of this part regarding communications about the payment of overdrafts that would not trigger periodic statement disclosures;

ii. Includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of an overdraft limit or the amount of funds available for overdrafts. For example, a credit union that includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of a $500 overdraft limit or that the member has $300 remaining on the overdraft limit, is promoting an overdraft service;

iii. Discloses an overdraft limit or includes the dollar amount of an overdraft limit in a balance disclosed by any means, including on an ATM receipt or on an automated system, such as a telephone response machine, ATM screen, or the credit union's Internet site.
