###### Investments in certain subsidiaries,Unconsolidated banking or finance subsidiaries.

2.- a.The aggregate amount of investments in banking or finance subsidiarieswhose financial statements are not consolidated for accounting or regulatory reporting purposes, regardless of whether the investment is made by the parent bank holding company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries, will be deducted from the consolidated parent banking organization's total capital components.Generally, investments for this purpose are defined as equity and debt capital investments and any other instruments that are deemed to be capital in the particular subsidiary.

Advances (that is, loans, extensions of credit, guarantees, commitments, or any other forms of credit exposure) to the subsidiary that are not deemed to be capital will generally not be deducted from an organization's capital. Rather, such advances generally will be included in the parent banking organization's consolidated assets and be assigned to the 100 percent risk category, unless such obligations are backed by recognized collateral or guarantees, in which case they will be assigned to the risk category appropriate to such collateral or guarantees. These advances may, however, also be deducted from the consolidated parent banking organization's capital if, in the judgment of the Federal Reserve, the risks stemming from such advances are comparable to the risks associated with capital investments or if the advances involve other risk factors that warrant such an adjustment to capital for supervisory purposes. These other factors could include, for example, the absence of collateral support.

Inasmuch as the assets of unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries are not fully reflected in a banking organization's consolidated total assets, such assets may be viewed as the equivalent of off-balance sheet exposures since the operations of an unconsolidated subsidiary could expose the parent organization and its affiliates to considerable risk. For this reason, it is generally appropriate to view the capital resources invested in these unconsolidated entities as primarily supporting the risks inherent in these off-balance sheet assets, and not generally available to support risks or absorb losses elsewhere in the organization.
