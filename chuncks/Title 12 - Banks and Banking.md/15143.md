2.Under ยง 226.58(c)(5), a card issuer is not required to submit any credit card agreements to the Board under ยง 226.58(c)(1) if the card issuer has fewer than 10,000 open credit card accounts as of the last business day of the calendar quarter. For example, a card issuer offers five credit card agreements to the public as of September 30. However, the card issuer has only 2,000 open credit card accounts as of September 30. The card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board by October 31 because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception.
