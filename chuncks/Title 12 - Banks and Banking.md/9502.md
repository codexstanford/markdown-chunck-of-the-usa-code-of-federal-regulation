##### Subpart D-Risk-Weighted Assets-Standardized Approach

####### ยง 217.38 Unsettled transactions.
######## Non-DvP/non-PvP (non-delivery-versus-payment/non-payment-versus-payment) transactions.

(e)(1) A Board-regulated institution must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the Board-regulated institution has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The Board-regulated institution must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the Board-regulated institution has received its corresponding deliverables.

(2) From the business day after the Board-regulated institution has made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the transaction by treating the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the Board-regulated institution as an exposure to the counterparty and using the applicable counterparty risk weight under this subpart D.

(3) If the Board-regulated institution has not received its deliverables by the fifth business day after counterparty delivery was due, the Board-regulated institution must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the Board-regulated institution.
