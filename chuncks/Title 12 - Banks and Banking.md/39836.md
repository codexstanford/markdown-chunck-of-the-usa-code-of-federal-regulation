#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Fully indexed rate.

1.The fully indexed rate is defined in § 1026.18(s)(7) as the index plus the margin at consummation. For purposes of § 1026.18(s)(2)(iii)(C), "at consummation" refers to disclosures delivered at consummation, or three business days before consummation pursuant to § 1026.19(a)(2)(ii); for early disclosures delivered within three business days after receipt of a consumer's application pursuant to § 1026.19(a)(1), the fully indexed rate disclosed under § 1026.18(s)(2)(iii)(C) may be based on the index in effect at the time the disclosures are provided. The index in effect at consummation (or at the time of early disclosures) need not be used if a contract provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value. For example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on the index value in effect 45 days before the change date, creditors may use any index value in effect during the 45 days before consummation (or any earlier date of disclosure) in calculating the fully indexed rate to be disclosed.
