###### Appendix A to Subpart C of Part 210-Commentary
####### et seq.

(4) Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer, any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (15 U.S.C. 1693). A funds transfer from a consumer originator or a funds transfer to a consumer beneficiary could be carried out through the FedNow Service and could potentially be subject to the EFTA and Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) implementing it. If so, the funds transfer continues to also be governed by subpart C, except that, in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of subpart C and the EFTA, the EFTA shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. (See also the commentary to section 210.41 in this appendix, "Payment Order.") For example, a funds transfer may be initiated from a consumer's account at a depository institution, and the depository institution may execute that payment order by sending a conforming payment order to a Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service. If that transfer is subject to the EFTA, then examples of how the provisions of subpart C may govern the transfer include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Where the consumer subsequently gives timely notice that the transfer was an unauthorized electronic fund transfer to its depository institution and exercises the right to obtain a refund under the EFTA, the depository institution would be required to comply with the EFTA and the applicable provisions of the EFTA would govern the institution's obligations to its customer, even if under subpart C the institution does not have a right to receive a refund or reverse the payment order sent to the Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service.

(ii) Where the customer properly asserts an error under the EFTA with respect to the transfer and exercises the right to obtain a refund to correct the error under the EFTA, the depository institution would be required to comply with the EFTA and the applicable provisions of the EFTA would govern the institution's obligations to its customer, even if under subpart C the institution is obliged to pay its payment order sent to the Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service.
