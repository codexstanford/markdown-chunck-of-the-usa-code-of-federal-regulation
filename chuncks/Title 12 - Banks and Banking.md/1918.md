###### Application to include subordinated debt in tier 2 capital.

(ii)A national bank that intends to include subordinated debt in tier 2 capital must submit an application to the OCC for approval, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, before or within ten days after issuing the subordinated debt. Where a national bank's application to issue subordinated debt has been deemed to be approved, in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, and the national bank does not contemporaneously receive approval from the OCC to include the subordinated debt as tier 2 capital, the national bank must submit an application for approval to include subordinated debt in tier 2 capital, pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, after issuance of the subordinated debt. A national bank may not include subordinated debt in tier 2 capital unless the national bank has filed the application with the OCC and received approval from the OCC that the subordinated debt issued by the national bank qualifies as tier 2 capital.
