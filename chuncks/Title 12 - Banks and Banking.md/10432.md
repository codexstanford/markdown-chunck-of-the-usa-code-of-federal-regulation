(d) As the Board has recognized, indirect security can encompass a wide variety of arrangements between lenders and borrowers with respect to margin stock collateral that serve to protect the lenders' interest in assuring that a credit is repaid where the lenders do not have a conventional direct security interest in the collateral.ยง 221.124. However, credit is not "indirectly secured" by margin stock if the lender in good faith has not relied on the margin stock as collateral extending or maintaining credit.ยง 221.2.
