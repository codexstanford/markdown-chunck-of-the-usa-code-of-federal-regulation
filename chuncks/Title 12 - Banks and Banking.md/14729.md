###### Reasonable diligence.

1.A creditor will be deemed to have acted with reasonable diligence under ยง 226.42(e) if the creditor extends credit based on a valuation other than the valuation subject to the restriction in ยง 226.42(e). A creditor need not obtain a second valuation to document that the creditor has acted with reasonable diligence to determine that the valuation does not materially misstate or misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling, however. For example, assume an appraiser notifies a creditor before consummation that a loan originator attempted to cause the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the appraiser's independent judgment, through coercion. If the creditor reasonably determines and documents that the appraisal does not materially misstate or misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling, for purposes of ยง 226.42(e), the creditor may extend credit based on the appraisal.
