###### Prior notice exemption.

(3)The following transactions are not subject to the prior notice requirements of this section but are otherwise subject to this section, including filing a notice and paying the appropriate filing fee, within 90 calendar days after the transaction occurs:

(i) The acquisition of control as a result of acquisition of voting shares of a national bank or Federal savings association through testate or intestate succession;

(ii) The acquisition of control as a result of acquisition of voting shares of a national bank or Federal savings association as a bona fide gift;

(iii) The acquisition of voting shares of a national bank or Federal savings association resulting from a redemption of voting securities;

(iv) The acquisition of control of a national bank or Federal savings association as a result of actions by third parties (including the sale of securities) that are not within the control of the acquiror; and

(v) The acquisition of control as a result of the acquisition of voting shares of a national bank or Federal savings association in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in good faith.

(A) "Good faith" means that a person must either make, renew, or acquire a loan secured by voting securities of a national bank or Federal savings association in advance of any knowledge of a default or of the substantial likelihood that a default is forthcoming. A person who purchases a previously defaulted loan, or a loan for which there is a substantial likelihood of default, secured by voting securities of a national bank or Federal savings association may not rely on this paragraph (c)(3)(v) to foreclose on that loan, seize or purchase the underlying collateral, and acquire control of the national bank or Federal savings association without complying with the prior notice requirements of this section.

(B) To ensure compliance with this section, the acquiror of a defaulted loan secured by a controlling amount of a national bank's or a Federal savings association's voting securities must file a notice prior to the time the loan is acquired unless the acquiror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that the voting securities are not the anticipated source of repayment for the loan.
