#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### General.

1.For loans that permit interest-only payments, the creditor must use the fully indexed rate or introductory rate, whichever is greater, to calculate the substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest that will repay the loan amount over the term of the loan remaining as of the date the loan is recast. For discussion regarding the fully indexed rate, and the meaning of "substantially equal," see comments 43(b)(3)-1 through -5 and 43(c)(5)(i)-4, respectively. Under § 1026.43(c)(5)(ii)(B), the relevant term of the loan is the period of time that remains as of the date the loan is recast to require fully amortizing payments. For a loan on which only interest and no principal has been paid, the loan amount will be the outstanding principal balance at the time of the recast. "Loan amount" and "recast" are defined in § 1026.43(b)(5) and (b)(11), respectively. "Interest-only" and "Interest-only loan" are defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(iv).
