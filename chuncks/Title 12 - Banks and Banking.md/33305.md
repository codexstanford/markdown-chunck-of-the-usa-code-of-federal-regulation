##### Integrated instruments.

3.When a creditor uses an integrated instrument that combines the note and the security agreement, the spouse cannot be asked to sign the integrated instrument if the signature is only needed to grant a security interest. But the spouse could be asked to sign an integrated instrument that makes clear-for example, by a legend placed next to the spouse's signature-that the spouse's signature is only to grant a security interest and that signing the instrument does not impose personal liability.
