###### Fees for returning items unpaid.

4.The total dollar amount for all fees for returning items unpaid must include all fees charged to the account for dishonoring or returning checks or other items drawn on the account. The credit union must disclose separate totals for the statement period and for the calendar year-to-date. Fees imposed when deposited items are returned are not included. Credit unions may use terminology such as "returned item fee" or "NSF fee" to describe fees for returning items unpaid.
