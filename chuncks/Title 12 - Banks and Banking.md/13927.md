###### Material disclosures.

2.Footnote 36 sets forth the material disclosures that must be provided before the rescission period can begin to run. The creditor must provide sufficient information to satisfy the requirements of ยง 226.6 for these disclosures. A creditor may satisfy this requirement by giving an initial disclosure statement that complies with the regulation. Failure to give the other required initial disclosures (such as the billing rights statement) or the information required under section 226.5b. does not prevent the running of the rescission period, although that failure may result in civil liability or administrative sanctions. The payment terms set forth in footnote 36 apply to any repayment phase set forth in the agreement. Thus, the payment terms described in ยง 226.6(e)(2) for any repayment phase as well as for the draw period are "material disclosures."
