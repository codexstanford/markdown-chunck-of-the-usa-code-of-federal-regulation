###### Form of objections stated during the deposition.

(2)An objection at the time of the examination-whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the deposition officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition-must be noted on the record, but the examination may still proceed and the testimony may be taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the hearing officer, or to present a motion to the hearing officer for a limitation on the questioning in the deposition.
