2.i. For purposes of § 1026.16(d)(6), a clear and conspicuous disclosure means that the required information in § 1026.16(d)(6)(ii)(A)-(C) is disclosed with equal prominence and in close proximity to the promotional rate or payment to which it applies. If the information in § 1026.16(d)(6)(ii)(A)-(C) is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the promotional rate or payment to which it applies, without any intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent and in close proximity. Notwithstanding the above, for electronic advertisements that disclose promotional rates or payments, compliance with the requirements of § 1026.16(c) is deemed to satisfy the clear and conspicuous standard.

ii. For purposes of § 1026.16(g)(4) as it applies to written or electronic advertisements only, a clear and conspicuous disclosure means the required information in § 1026.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) must be equally prominent to the promotional rate or promotional fee to which it applies. If the information in § 1026.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) is the same type size as the promotional rate or promotional fee to which it applies, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent. For purposes of § 1026.16(h)(3) as it applies to written or electronic advertisements only, a clear and conspicuous disclosure means the required information in § 1026.16(h)(3) must be equally prominent to each statement of "no interest," "no payments," "deferred interest," "same as cash," or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period. If the information required to be disclosed under § 1026.16(h)(3) is the same type size as the statement of "no interest," "no payments," "deferred interest," "same as cash," or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period, the disclosure would be deemed to be equally prominent.
