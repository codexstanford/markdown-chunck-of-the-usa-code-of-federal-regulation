2.Creditors that choose to disclose an annual percentage rate calculated under § 1026.14(c) and label the figure as "annual percentage rate" must label the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate as the "corresponding APR," "nominal APR," or a similar phrase as provided in comment 7(a)(4)-4. Creditors also comply with the label requirement if the rate calculated under § 1026.14(c) is described as the "effective APR" or something similar. For those creditors, the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate could be labeled "annual percentage rate," consistent with the requirement under § 1026.7(b)(4). If the two rates represent different values, creditors must label the rates differently to meet the clear and conspicuous standard under § 1026.5(a)(1).
