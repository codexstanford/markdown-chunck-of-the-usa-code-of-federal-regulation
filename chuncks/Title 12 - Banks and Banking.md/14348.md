###### Delay beyond rescission period.

4.The creditor must wait until it is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded. For example, the creditor may satisfy itself by doing one of the following:

- Waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the rescission period to allow for delivery of a mailed notice.

- Obtaining a written statement from the consumer that the right has not been exercised.

When more than one consumer has the right to rescind, the creditor cannot reasonably rely on the assurance of only one consumer, because other consumers may exercise the right.
