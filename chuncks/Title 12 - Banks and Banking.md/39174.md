##### Spreader clause.

3.If collateral for preexisting credit with the creditor will secure the plan being opened, the creditor must disclose that fact. (Such security interests may be known as "spreader" or "dragnet" clauses, or as "cross-collateralization" clauses.) The creditor need not specifically identify the collateral; a reminder such as "collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan" is sufficient. At the creditor's option, a more specific description of the property involved may be given.
