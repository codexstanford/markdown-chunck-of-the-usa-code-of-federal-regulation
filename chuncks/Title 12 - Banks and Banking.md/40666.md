### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Interest only.,e.g.,

ii.When disclosing an "Interest Only" feature, as defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(iv), the applicable time period must precede the label "Interest Only." Thus, a fixed rate loan with only interest due for the first five years of the loan term is disclosed as "5 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate." If the interest only feature fails to cover the total interest due, then, as required by § 1026.37(a)(10)(iii), the disclosure must reference the negative amortization feature and not the interest only feature ("5 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate"). See comment app. D-7.ii for an explanation of the disclosure of the time period of an interest only feature for a construction loan or a construction-permanent loan.
