###### Reloadable.

2.A general-use prepaid card is "reloadable" if the terms and conditions of the agreement permit funds to be added to the general-use prepaid card at any time after the initial purchase or issuance. A general-use prepaid card is not "reloadable" merely because the issuer or processor is technically able to add functionality that would otherwise enable the general-use prepaid card to be reloaded.
