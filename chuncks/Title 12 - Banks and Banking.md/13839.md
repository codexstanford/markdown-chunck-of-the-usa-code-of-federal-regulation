##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Holds on accounts.

1."Freezing" or placing a hold on funds in the cardholder's deposit account is the functional equivalent of an offset and would contravene the prohibition in ยง 226.12(d)(1), unless done in the context of one of the exceptions specified in ยง 226.12(d)(2). For example, if the terms of a security agreement permitted the card issuer to place a hold on the funds, the hold would not violate the offset prohibition. Similarly, if an order of a bankruptcy court required the card issuer to turn over deposit account funds to the trustee in bankruptcy, the issuer would not violate the regulation by placing a hold on the funds in order to comply with the court order.
