##### Down payment and funds from borrower calculation.,1,2

1.Under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(), the down payment and funds from borrower amount is calculated as the difference between the sale price of the property disclosed under § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A) and the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.38(b) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv), except as required by § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(). The calculation is independent of any loan program or investor requirements. The "Final" amount disclosed for "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" reflects any change, following delivery of the Loan Estimate, in the amount of down payment and other funds required of the consumer. This change might result, for example, from an increase in the purchase price of the property.
