#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Permissible changes.

1.The changes required or permitted by § 1026.37(o)(5) are permitted for federally related mortgage loans for which the use of form H-24 is required under § 1026.37(o)(3). For non-federally related mortgage loans, the changes required or permitted by § 1026.37(o)(5) do not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure and therefore, are permissible. Any changes to the disclosure not specified in § 1026.37(o)(5) or not permitted by other provisions of § 1026.37 are not permissible for federally related mortgage loans. Creditors in non-federally related mortgage loans making any changes that affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure will lose their protection from civil liability under TILA section 130.
