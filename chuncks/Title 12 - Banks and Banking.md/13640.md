###### Billing cycle where paying the minimum payment due for that billing cycle will pay the outstanding balance on the account for that billing cycle.

1.Under ยง 226.7(b)(12)(v)(C), a card issuer is exempt from the repayment disclosure requirements set forth in ยง 226.7(b)(12) for a particular billing cycle where paying the minimum payment due for that billing cycle will pay the outstanding balance on the account for that billing cycle. For example, if the entire outstanding balance on an account for a particular billing cycle is $20 and the minimum payment is $20, an issuer would not need to comply with the repayment disclosure requirements for that particular billing cycle. In addition, this exemption would apply to a charged-off account where payment of the entire account balance is due immediately.
