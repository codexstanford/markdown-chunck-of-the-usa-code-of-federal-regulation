##### Requirement.

1.Pursuant to § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), good faith is determined by calculating the difference between the estimated charges originally provided pursuant to § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the actual charges paid by or imposed on the consumer. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) provides the exception to this rule. Pursuant to § 1026.19(e)(3)(iv), for purposes of determining good faith under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), the creditor may use a revised estimate of a charge instead of the amount originally disclosed under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the revision is due to one of the reasons set forth in § 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (F).
