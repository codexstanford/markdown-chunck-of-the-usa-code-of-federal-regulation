####### ยง 324.131 Mechanics for calculating total wholesale and retail risk-weighted assets.
######## Phase 4-Calculation of risk-weighted assets,Non-defaulted exposures.

(e)-(1)(i) An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the dollar risk-based capital requirement for each of its wholesale exposures to a non-defaulted obligor (except for eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives that hedge another wholesale exposure, IMM exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions, and exposures to which the FDIC-supervised institution applies the double default treatment in ยง 324.135) and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures by inserting the assigned risk parameters for the wholesale obligor and exposure or retail segment into the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 to ยง 324.131 and multiplying the output of the formula (K) by the EAD of the exposure or segment. Alternatively, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply a 300 percent risk weight to the EAD of an eligible margin loan if the FDIC-supervised institution is not able to meet the FDIC's requirements for estimation of PD and LGD for the margin loan.

(ii) The sum of all the dollar risk-based capital requirements for each wholesale exposure to a non-defaulted obligor and segment of non-defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and in ยง 324.135(e) equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement for those exposures and segments.

(iii) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to non-defaulted obligors and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.
