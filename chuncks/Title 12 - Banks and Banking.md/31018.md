###### United States Government-sponsored agency or corporation

means an agency or corporation originally established or chartered to serve public purposes specified by the United States Congress but whose obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.

Except as provided in Section II(b) of this Appendix, risk-weighted on-balance sheet assets are computed by multiplying the on-balance sheet asset amounts times the appropriate risk-weight categories. The risk-weight categories are:

(1) Zero percent Risk-Weight (Category 1).

(i) Cash, including domestic and foreign currency owned and held in all offices of a corporate credit union or in transit. Any foreign currency held by a corporate credit union must be converted into U.S. dollar equivalents;

(ii) Securities issued by and other direct claims on the U.S. Government or its agencies (to the extent such securities or claims are unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government) or the central government of an OECD country;

(iii) Notes and obligations issued or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government;

(iv) Deposit reserves at, claims on, and balances due from Federal Reserve Banks;

(v) The book value of paid-in Federal Reserve Bank stock;

(vi) That portion of assets directly and unconditionally guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country.

(viii) Claims on, and claims guaranteed by, a qualifying securities firm that are collateralized by cash on deposit in the corporate credit union or by securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country. To be eligible for this risk-weight, the corporate credit union must maintain a positive margin of collateral on the claim on a daily basis, taking into account any change in a corporate credit union's exposure to the obligor or counterparty under the claim in relation to the market value of the collateral held in support of the claim.

(2) 20 percent Risk-Weight (Category 2).

(i) Cash items in the process of collection;

(ii) That portion of assets conditionally guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country;

(iii) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market value of securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country;

(iv) Securities (not including equity securities) issued by and other claims on the U.S. Government or its agencies which are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government;

(v) Securities (not including equity securities) issued by, or other direct claims on, United States Government-sponsored agencies;

(vi) That portion of assets guaranteed by United States Government-sponsored agencies;

(vii) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market value of securities issued or guaranteed by United States Government-sponsored agencies;

(viii) Claims on, and claims guaranteed by, a qualifying securities firm, subject to the following conditions:

(A) A qualifying securities firm must meet the minimum credit quality standards as established by the corporate credit union's board of directors or have at least one issue of long-term unsecured debt that is reasonably determined to present no more than a minimal amount of credit risk, whichever requirement is more stringent. Alternatively, a qualifying securities firm may rely on the creditworthiness of its parent consolidated company, if the parent consolidated company guarantees the claim.

(B) A collateralized claim on a qualifying securities firm does not have to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section of Appendix C if the claim arises under a contract that:
