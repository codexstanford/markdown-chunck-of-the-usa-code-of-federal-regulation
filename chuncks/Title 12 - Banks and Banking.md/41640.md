# Title 12 - Banks and Banking
## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### As applicable.

1.The disclosures required by this subpart need be made only as applicable, unless specifically required otherwise. The creditor need not provide any disclosure that is not applicable to a particular transaction. For example, in a transaction consolidating private education loans, or in transactions under § 1026.46(a) for which compliance with this subpart is optional, the creditor need not disclose the information under §§ 1026.47(a)(6), and (b)(4), and any other information otherwise required to be disclosed under this subpart that is not applicable to the transaction. Similarly, creditors making loans to consumers where the student is not attending an institution of higher education, as defined in § 1026.46(b)(2), need not provide the disclosures regarding the self-certification form in § 1026.47(a)(8).
