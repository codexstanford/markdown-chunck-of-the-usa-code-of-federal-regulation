###### Rate disclosures.

1.In addition to the dividend rate and annual percentage yield, credit unions may disclose a periodic rate corresponding to the dividend rate. No other rate or yield (such as "tax effective yield") is permitted. If the annual percentage yield is the same as the dividend rate, credit unions may disclose a single figure but must use both terms.
