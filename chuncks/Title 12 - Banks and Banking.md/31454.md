###### Conditions not related to share accounts.

8.Credit unions may advertise accounts as "free" for members that meet conditions not related to share accounts, such as the member's age. For example, credit unions may advertise a share draft account as "free for persons over 65 years old," even though a maintenance or activity fee may be assessed on accounts held by members that are 65 or younger.
