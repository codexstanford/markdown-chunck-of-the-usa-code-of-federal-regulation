#### PART 226-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
##### Appendix K to Part 226 - Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations for Reverse Mortgage Transactions
###### Assumption for discretionary cash advances.

(9)If the consumer controls the timing of advances made after consummation (such as in a credit line arrangement), the creditor must use the general formula in paragraph (b)(7) of this appendix. The total annual loan cost rate shall be based on the assumption that 50 percent of the principal loan amount is advanced at closing, or in the case of an open-end transaction, at the time the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. Creditors shall assume the advances are made at the interest rate then in effect and that no further advances are made to, or repayments made by, the consumer during the term of the transaction or plan.
