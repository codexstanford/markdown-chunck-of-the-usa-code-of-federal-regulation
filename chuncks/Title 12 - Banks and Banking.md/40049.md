##### Loan modifications.

2.Under § 1026.20(c), the interest rate adjustment disclosures are required only for interest rate adjustments occurring pursuant to the loan contract. Accordingly, creditors, assignees, and servicers need not provide the disclosures for interest rate adjustments occurring in loan modifications made for loss mitigation purposes. Subsequent interest rate adjustments resulting in a corresponding payment change occurring pursuant to the modified loan contract, however, are subject to the requirements of § 1026.20(c).
