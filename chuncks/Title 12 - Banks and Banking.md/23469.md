The values for Zand Zwill be selected to ensure that, for an assessment period shortly before adoption of a final rule, aggregate assessments for all established small institutions would have been approximately the same under the final rule as they would have been under the assessment rate schedule that-under rules in effect before adoption of the final rule-will automatically go into effect when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent. As an example, using aggregate assessments for all established small institutions for the third quarter of 2013 to determine Zand Z, and assuming thathad equaled 3 basis points andhad equaled 30 basis points, the value of Zwould have been 0.87 and the value of Z-6.36. Hence based on equations 4 and 5,

Therefore from equation 3, it follows that
