###### Authority to decline or rescind a block.

(4)A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block of, adverse items of information resulting from a severe form of trafficking in persons or sex trafficking, in accordance with the timing requirements under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, only where the consumer reporting agency cannot reasonably confirm the appropriate proof of identity under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the consumer, and, if applicable, the consumer's representative, the consumer cannot provide documentation consisting of a victim determination under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, or the consumer reporting agency cannot properly identify the adverse items of information under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. A consumer reporting agency may not, however, decline to block or rescind any block of adverse information identified by the consumer or if applicable, the consumer's representative, based on the validity of the facts or circumstances detailed in the contents of the submitted trafficking documentation as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. A consumer reporting agency may decline or rescind a block only after notifying the consumer using the method of contact specified by the consumer in paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section and attempting to resolve any deficiency in the consumer's submission as required in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
