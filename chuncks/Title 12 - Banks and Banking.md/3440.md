## Chapter I - Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury
### PART 26 - MANAGEMENT OFFICIAL INTERLOCKS
#### ยง 26.8 Enforcement.

Except as provided in this section, the OCC administers and enforces the Interlocks Act with respect to national banks, Federal savings associations, and their affiliates, and may refer any case of a prohibited interlocking relationship involving these entities to the Attorney General of the United States to enforce compliance with the Interlocks Act and this part. If an affiliate of a national bank or Federal savings association is subject to the primary regulation of another Federal depository organization supervisory agency, then the OCC does not administer and enforce the Interlocks Act with respect to that affiliate.
