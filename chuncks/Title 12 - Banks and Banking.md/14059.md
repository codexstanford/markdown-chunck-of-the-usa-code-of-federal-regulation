###### Allocation of points.

5.When a creditor utilizes the special rule in ยง 226.17(c)(6) to disclose credit extensions as multiple transactions, buyers points or similar amounts imposed on the consumer must be allocated for purposes of calculating disclosures. While such amounts should not be taken into account more than once in making calculations, they may be allocated between the transactions in any manner the creditor chooses. For example, if a construction-permanent loan is subject to 5 points imposed on the consumer and the creditor chooses to disclose the 2 phases separately, the 5 points may be allocated entirely to the construction loan, entirely to the permanent loan, or divided in any manner between the two. However, the entire 5 points may not be applied twice, that is, to both the construction and the permanent phases.
