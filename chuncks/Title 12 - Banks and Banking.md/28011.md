(2) The transaction is a "business loan" as defined in ยง 614.4240(e) that:

(ii) Is not dependent on income derived from the sale or cash rental of real estate as the primary source of repayment;

(3) A lien on real property has been taken as collateral in an abundance of caution, and the application, when evaluated on the five basic credit factors, without considering the subject real estate, would support the credit decision that was based on other sources of repayment or collateral;

(4) A lien on real estate is not statutorily required and has been taken for purposes other than the real estate's value;

(5) Subsequent loan transactions (which include but are not limited to loan servicing actions, reamortizations, modifications of loan terms, and partial releases), provided that either:

(i) The transaction does not involve the advancement of new loan funds other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; or

(ii) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the adequacy of the Farm Credit System institution's real estate collateral protection, even with the advancement of new loan funds;

(6) A Farm Credit System institution purchases a loan or an interest in a loan, pool of loans, or interests in real property, including mortgage-backed securities, provided that:

(i) The appraisal prepared for each loan, pooled loan, or real property interest, when originated, met the standards of this subpart, other Federal regulations adopted pursuant to FIRREA, or the requirements of the government-sponsored secondary market intermediaries under whose auspices the interest is sold; and

(ii) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that would threaten the Farm Credit System institution's collateral position, or

(7) A Farm Credit System institution makes or purchases a loan secured by real estate, which loan is guaranteed by an agency of the United States Government and is supported by an appraisal that conforms to the requirements of the guaranteeing agency.

To qualify for exceptions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section from the requirements of this subpart, the institution must have documentation justifying the use of such exceptions in the applicable loan file(s). In addition, the institution must document that the repayment of a "business loan" is not dependent on income derived from the sale or cash rental of real estate.
