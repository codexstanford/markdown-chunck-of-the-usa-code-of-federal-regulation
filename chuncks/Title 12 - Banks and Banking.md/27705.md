####### Disclosure to loan applicants and equity holders after commencement resolution.

(d)Between the date your board of directors adopts the commencement resolution and the termination date, you must give the following information to your loan applicants and equity holders:

(1) For each loan applicant who is not a current stockholder, describe at the time of loan application:

(i) The effect of the proposed termination on the prospective loan; and

(ii) Whether, after the proposed termination, the borrower will continue to have any of the borrower rights provided under the Act and regulations.

(2) For any equity holders who ask to have their equities retired, explain that the retirement would extinguish the holder's right to exchange those equities for an interest in the successor institution. In addition, inform holders of equities entitled to your residual assets in liquidation that retirement before termination would extinguish their right to dissent from the termination and have their equities retired.
