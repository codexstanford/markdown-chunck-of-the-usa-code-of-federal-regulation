###### Subsequent changes in terms.

ii.The fact that an issuer may reserve the right to change a rate subsequent to account opening, pursuant to the notice requirements of ยง 226.9(c) and the limitations in ยง 226.55, does not, by itself, make that rate an introductory rate. For example, assume an issuer discloses an annual percentage rate for purchases of 12.99% but does not specify a time period during which that rate will be in effect. Even if that issuer subsequently increases the annual percentage rate for purchases to 15.99%, pursuant to a change-in-terms notice provided under ยง 226.9(c), the 12.99% is not an introductory rate.
