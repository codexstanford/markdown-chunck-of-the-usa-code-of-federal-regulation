###### Procedure.

(b)An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with the motion for leave. The motion for leave must identify the interest of the movant and state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae is desirable. Except as all parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae must file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position the amicus will support, unless the Director or hearing officer, as appropriate, for good cause shown, grants leave for a later filing. If a later filing is allowed, the order granting leave to file must specify when an opposing party may reply to the brief.
