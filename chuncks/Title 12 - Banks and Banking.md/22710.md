######## Advanced CVA approach.

(6)(i) An FDIC-supervised institution may use the VaR model that it uses to determine specific risk under ยง 324.207(b) or another VaR model that meets the quantitative requirements of ยง 324.205(b) and ยง 324.207(b)(1) to calculate its CVA capital requirement for a counterparty by modeling the impact of changes in the counterparties' credit spreads, together with any recognized CVA hedges, on the CVA for the counterparties, subject to the following requirements:

(A) The VaR model must incorporate only changes in the counterparties' credit spreads, not changes in other risk factors. The VaR model does not need to capture jump-to-default risk;

(B) An FDIC-supervised institution that qualifies to use the advanced CVA approach must include in that approach any immaterial OTC derivative portfolios for which it uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk in paragraph (c) of this section according to paragraph (e)(6)(viii) of this section; and

(C) An FDIC-supervised institution must have the systems capability to calculate the CVA capital requirement for a counterparty on a daily basis (but is not required to calculate the CVA capital requirement on a daily basis).

(ii) Under the advanced CVA approach, the CVA capital requirement, K, is calculated according to the following formulas:

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (e)(6)(ii) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution must use the formulas in paragraphs (e)(6)(iii)(A) or (e)(6)(iii)(B) of this section to calculate credit spread sensitivities if its VaR model is not based on full repricing.

(A) If the VaR model is based on credit spread sensitivities for specific tenors, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate each credit spread sensitivity according to the following formula:

(B) If the VaR model uses credit spread sensitivities to parallel shifts in credit spreads, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate each credit spread sensitivity according to the following formula:
