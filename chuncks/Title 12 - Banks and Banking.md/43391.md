### PART 1081-RULES OF PRACTICE FOR ADJUDICATION PROCEEDINGS
#### Subpart B-Initiation of Proceedings and Prehearing Rules
##### § 1081.208 Subpoenas.
###### Relationship to scheduling of hearing.

(l)The parties must disclose at the scheduling conference required under § 1081.203(e) whether they intend to request the issuance of subpoenas under § 1081.209. A respondent's request for issuance of a subpoena constitutes a request that the hearing not be held until after a reasonable period, determined by the hearing officer, for the completion of discovery. The hearing officer will decide whether to grant such a request. If the request is granted, the hearing officer will set a deadline for the completion of discovery and schedule the specific date of the hearing, in consultation with the parties. This paragraph (l) does not apply to a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of a witness at the hearing or a subpoena to depose a witness unavailable for the hearing.
