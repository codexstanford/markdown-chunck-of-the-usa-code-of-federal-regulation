2.Under § 226.35(b)(3)(v), for "jumbo" loans, the annual percentage rate threshold is 2.5 or more percentage points greater than the average prime offer rate. This threshold applies solely in determining whether a "jumbo" loan is subject to the escrow requirement of § 226.35(b)(3). The determination of whether "jumbo" first-lien loans are subject to the other protections in § 226.35, such as the ability to repay requirements under § 226.35(b)(1) and the restrictions on prepayment penalties under § 226.35(b)(2), is based on the 1.5 percentage point threshold stated in § 226.35(a)(1).
