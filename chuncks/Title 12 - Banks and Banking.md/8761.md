#### PART 213 - CONSUMER LEASING (REGULATION M)
##### ยง 213.2 Definitions.
###### Consumer lease

(e)(1)means a contract in the form of a bailment or lease for the use of personal property by a natural person primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, for a period exceeding four months and for a total contractual obligation not exceeding the applicable threshold amount, whether or not the lessee has the option to purchase or otherwise become the owner of the property at the expiration of the lease. The threshold amount is adjusted annually to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as applicable. See the official staff commentary to this paragraph (e) for the threshold amount applicable to a specific consumer lease. Unless the context indicates otherwise, in this part "lease" means "consumer lease."

(2) The term does not include a lease that meets the definition of a credit sale in Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.2(a)). It also does not include a lease for agricultural, business, or commercial purposes or a lease made to an organization.

(3) This part does not apply to a lease transaction of personal property which is incident to the lease of real property and which provides that:

(i) The lessee has no liability for the value of the personal property at the end of the lease term except for abnormal wear and tear; and

(ii) The lessee has no option to purchase the leased property.
