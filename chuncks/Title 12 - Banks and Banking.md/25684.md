(2) Whether the documentary material was generated or maintained as records in the regular course of the business of the insured depository institution in accordance with its own recordkeeping practices and procedures or pursuant to standards established by its regulators,

(3) Whether the documentary material is needed by the FDIC to carry out its receivership function, and

(4) The expected evidentiary needs of the FDIC.
