##### Estimated amounts.,See

1.Certain amounts are estimated when provided on the disclosure required by § 1026.37. When disclosed as required by § 1026.38, however, many of the corresponding disclosures must be actual amounts rather than estimates in accordance with the requirements of § 1026.19(f), even though the provision of § 1026.38 cross-references a counterpart in § 1026.37. Section 1026.38(t)(2) provides that, if a master heading, heading, subheading, label, or similar designation contains the word "estimated" in form H-25 of appendix H to this part, that heading, label, or similar designation shall contain the word "estimated." Thus, § 1026.38(t)(2) incorporates the "estimated" designations reflected on form H-25 into the requirements of § 1026.38.comment 37(o)(2)-1.
