#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Credit.

1.Under § 1026.61(a)(1), except as provided in § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if the prepaid card can access credit from a covered separate credit feature as described in § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) or if it can access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account as described in § 1026.61(a)(3). When § 1026.61 references credit that can be accessed from a separate credit feature or credit that can be extended through a negative balance on the asset feature, it means credit that can be accessed or can be extended even if, for example:

i. The person that can extend the credit does not agree in writing to extend the credit;

ii. The person retains discretion not to extend the credit, or

iii. The person does not extend the credit once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit.
