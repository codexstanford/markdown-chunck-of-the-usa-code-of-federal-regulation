###### Reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital instruments.

3.Reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital instruments (that is, instruments that qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital) will be deducted from an organization's total capital components for the purpose of determining the numerator of the risk-based capital ratio.

Reciprocal holdings are cross-holdings resulting from formal or informal arrangements in which two or more banking organizations swap, exchange, or otherwise agree to hold each other's capital instruments. Generally, deductions will be limited to intentional cross-holdings. At present, the Board does not intend to require banking organizations to deduct non-reciprocal holdings of such capital instruments.
