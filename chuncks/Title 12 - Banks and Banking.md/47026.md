####### Capital charge reduction in certain other cases.

(4)The credit risk capital charge for a non-mortgage asset hedged with a credit derivative in accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall equal the sum of the credit risk capital charges for the hedged and unhedged portion of the non-mortgage asset provided that:

(i) The remaining maturity for the credit derivative is less than the remaining maturity for the hedged non-mortgage asset and either:

(A) The non-mortgage asset referenced in the credit derivative is identical to the hedged non-mortgage asset; or

(B) The non-mortgage asset referenced in the credit derivative is different from the hedged non-mortgage asset, but only if the asset referenced in the credit derivative and the hedged non-mortgage asset have been issued by the same obligor, the asset referenced in the credit derivative ranks pari passu to, or more junior than, the hedged non-mortgage asset and has the same maturity as the hedged non-mortgage asset, and cross-default clauses apply; and

(ii) The credit risk capital charge for the unhedged portion of the non-mortgage asset equals:

(A) The credit risk capital charge for the non-mortgage asset, calculated as the amortized cost, or fair value, of the non-mortgage asset multiplied by that asset's credit risk percentage requirement assigned pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section where the appropriate credit rating is that for the non-mortgage asset and the appropriate maturity is the remaining maturity of the non-mortgage asset; minus

(B) The credit risk capital charge for the non-mortgage asset, calculated as the amortized cost, or fair value, of the non-mortgage asset multiplied by that asset's credit risk percentage requirement assigned pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section where the appropriate credit rating is that for the non-mortgage asset but the appropriate maturity is deemed to be the remaining maturity of the credit derivative; and

(iii) The credit risk capital charge for the hedged portion of the non-mortgage asset is equal to the credit risk capital charge for the credit derivative, calculated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
