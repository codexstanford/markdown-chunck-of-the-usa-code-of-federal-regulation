######## Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred with retained contractual exposure.

(h)(1) Regardless of any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all the following conditions are met:

(i) The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.

(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the FDIC-supervised institution's reasonably estimated liability under the contractual obligation.

(iii) The small-business obligations are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 et seq.).

(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized, as defined in subpart H of this part. For purposes of determining whether an FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the FDIC-supervised institution's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations under this paragraph (h).

(2) The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by an FDIC-supervised institution on transfers of small-business obligations receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total capital.

(3) If an FDIC-supervised institution ceases to be well capitalized under subpart H of this part or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the capital treatment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with retained contractual exposure that occurred during the time that the FDIC-supervised institution was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.

(4) The risk-based capital ratios of the FDIC-supervised institution must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section for purposes of:

(i) Determining whether an FDIC-supervised institution is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized under subpart H of this part; and

(ii) Reclassifying a well-capitalized FDIC-supervised institution to adequately capitalized and requiring an adequately capitalized FDIC-supervised institution to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the FDIC-supervised institution were in the next lower prompt-corrective-action category.
