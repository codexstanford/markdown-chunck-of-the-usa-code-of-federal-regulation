###### ยง 204.128 Deposits at foreign branches guaranteed by domestic office of a depository institution.

(a) In accepting deposits at branches abroad, some depository institutions may enter into agreements from time to time with depositors that in effect guarantee payment of such deposits in the United States if the foreign branch is precluded from making payment.
