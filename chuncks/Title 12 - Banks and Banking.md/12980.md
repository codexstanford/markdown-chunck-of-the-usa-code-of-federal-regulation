(viii) Payments are credited either on the last day of the month or the last day of the billing cycle.

(xi) When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the assumed payments, current balance and interest charges for each month may be rounded to the nearest cent, as shown in Appendix M2 to this part.
