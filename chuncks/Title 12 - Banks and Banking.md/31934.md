###### Decision on application.

(c)In determining whether an activity is authorized as an appropriate exercise of a federal credit union's incidental powers, the Board will consider:

(1) Whether the activity is convenient or useful in carrying out the mission or business of credit unions consistent with the Act;

(2) Whether the activity is the functional equivalent or logical outgrowth of activities that are part of the mission or business of credit unions; and

(3) Whether the activity involves risks similar in nature to those already assumed as part of the business of credit unions.
