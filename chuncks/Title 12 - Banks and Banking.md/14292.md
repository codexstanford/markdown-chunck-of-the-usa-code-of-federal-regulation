###### Timing of adjustment notices.

1.This section requires a creditor (or a subsequent holder) to provide certain disclosures in cases where an adjustment to the interest rate is made in a variable-rate transaction subject to ยง 226.19(b). There are two timing rules, depending on whether payment changes accompany interest rate changes. A creditor is required to provide at least one notice each year during which interest rate adjustments have occurred without accompanying payment adjustments. For payment adjustments, a creditor must deliver or place in the mail notices to borrowers at least 25, but not more than 120, calendar days before a payment at a new level is due. The timing rules also apply to the notice required to be given in connection with the adjustment to the rate and payment that follows conversion of a transaction subject to ยง 226.19(b) to a fixed-rate transaction. (In cases where an open-end account is converted to a closed-end transaction subject to ยง 226.19(b), the requirements of this section do not apply until adjustments are made following conversion.)
