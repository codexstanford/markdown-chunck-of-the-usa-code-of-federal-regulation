####### Adjustments.

(c)(1) We will review your account balances, transactions over the 3 years before the date of the termination resolution under ยง 611.1220, and any subsequent transactions. Our review will include, but not be limited to, the following:

(i) Additions to or subtractions from any allowance for losses;

(ii) Additions to assets or liabilities, or subtractions from assets or liabilities, due to transactions that are outside your ordinary course of business;

(iii) Dividends or patronage refunds exceeding your usual practices;

(iv) Changes in the institution's capital plan, or in implementing the plan, that increased or decreased the level of borrower investment;

(v) Contingent liabilities, such as loss-sharing obligations, that can be reasonably quantified; and

(vi) Assets, including real property and servicing rights, that may be overvalued, undervalued, or not recorded on your books.

(2) If we determine the account balances do not accurately show the value of your assets and liabilities (whether the assets and liabilities were booked before or during the 3-year look-back adjustment period), we will make any adjustments we deem necessary.

(3) We may require you to reverse the effect of a transaction if we determine that:

(i) You have retired capital outside the ordinary course of business;

(ii) You have taken any other actions unrelated to your core business that have the effect of changing the exit fee; or

(iii) You incurred expenses related to termination prior to the 12-month average daily balance period on which the exit fee calculation is based.

(4) We may require you to make these adjustments to the preliminary exit fee estimate that is disclosed in the information statement, the final exit fee calculation, and the calculations of the value of equities held by dissenting stockholders, Farm Credit institutions that choose to have their equities retired at termination, and reaffiliating associations.
