###### Examples of credit unions promoting the payment of overdrafts.

1.A credit union must include the advertising disclosures in ยง 707.11(b)(1) of this part if the credit union:

i. Promotes the credit union's policy or practice of paying overdrafts, unless the service would be subject to 12 CFR part 1026 (Regulation Z). This includes advertisements using print media such as newspapers or brochures, telephone solicitations, electronic mail, or messages posted on an Internet site. But see, ยง 707.11(b)(2) of this part for communications that are not subject to the additional advertising disclosures;

ii. Includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of an overdraft limit or the amount of funds available for overdrafts. For example, a credit union that includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of a $500 overdraft limit or that the member has $300 remaining on the overdraft limit, is promoting an overdraft service.

iii. Discloses an overdraft limit or includes the dollar amount of an overdraft limit in a balance disclosed on an automated system, such as a telephone response machine, ATM screen, or the credit union's Internet site. See, however, ยง 707.11(b)(3) of this part.
