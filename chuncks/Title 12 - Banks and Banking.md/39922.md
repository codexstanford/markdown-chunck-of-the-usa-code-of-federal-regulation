For example, if an application is received on Monday, the creditor satisfies this requirement by either hand delivering the disclosures on or before Thursday, or placing them in the mail on or before Thursday, assuming each weekday is a business day. For purposes of § 1026.19(e)(1)(iii)(A), the term "business day" means a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying out substantially all of its business functions.§ 1026.2(a)(6).
