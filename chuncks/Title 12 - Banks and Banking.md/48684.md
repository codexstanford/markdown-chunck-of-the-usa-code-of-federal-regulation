###### Over-income tenants.

(g)(1) CMF-financed or assisted units continue to qualify as Affordable Housing despite a temporary noncompliance caused by increases in the incomes of existing tenants if actions satisfactory to the CDFI Fund are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled in accordance with this section until the noncompliance is corrected.

(2) Tenants whose incomes no longer qualify must pay rent no greater than the lesser of the amount payable by the tenant under State or local law or 30 percent of the Family's annual income, except if the gross rent of a unit is subject to the restrictions in IRC section 42(g)(2) or the restrictions in an extended low-income housing commitment under IRC section 42(h)(6), then the tenants of that unit must pay rent governed by those restrictions. Tenants who no longer qualify as Eligible-Income are not required to pay rent in excess of the market rent for comparable, unassisted units in the neighborhood.

(3) If the income of a tenant of a CMF-financed or assisted unit no longer qualifies, the Recipient may designate another unit, within the CMF-financed or assisted Project, as a replacement unit that meets the affordability qualifications for the same income category as the original unit, as further set forth in the Recipient's Assistance Agreement. If there is not an available replacement unit, the Recipient must fill the first available vacancy with a tenant that meets the affordability qualifications for the same income category of the original unit as necessary to maintain compliance with the CMF requirements and the Assistance Agreement.
