###### Deferred-tax assets.

4.a. The amount of deferred-tax assets that is dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for deferred-tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a bank holding company's capital may not exceed the lesser of:

i. The amount of these deferred-tax assets that the bank holding company is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,or

ii. 10 percent of tier 1 capital.

b. The reported amount of deferred-tax assets, net of any valuation allowance for deferred-tax assets, in excess of the lesser of these two amounts is to be deducted from a banking organization's core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating the 10 percent limitation, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements, net of goodwill and net of all identifiable intangible assets other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships, but prior to the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os, any disallowed deferred-tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments. There generally is no limit in tier 1 capital on the amount of deferred-tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carry-back years or from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.
