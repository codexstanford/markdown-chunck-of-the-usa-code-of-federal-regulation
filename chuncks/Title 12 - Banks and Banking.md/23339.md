####### Use of prepaid assessments.

(e)Prepaid assessments shall only be used to offset regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments payable under this subpart A. The FDIC will begin offsetting regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments against prepaid assessments on March 30, 2010. The FDIC will continue to make such offsets until the earlier of the exhaustion of the institution's prepaid assessment or June 30, 2013. Any prepaid assessment remaining after collection of the amount due on June 30, 2013, shall be returned to the institution. If the FDIC, in its discretion, determines that its liquidity needs allow, it may return any remaining prepaid assessment to the institution prior to June 30, 2013.
