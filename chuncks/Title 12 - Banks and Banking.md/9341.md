##### Subpart B-Capital Ratio Requirements and Buffers
###### ยง 217.11 Capital conservation buffer, countercyclical capital buffer amount, and GSIB surcharge.
####### Weighting.

(iii)The weight assigned to a jurisdiction's countercyclical capital buffer amount is calculated by dividing the total risk-weighted assets for the Board-regulated institution's private sector credit exposures located in the jurisdiction by the total risk-weighted assets for all of the Board-regulated institution's private sector credit exposures. The methodology a Board-regulated institution uses for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of this paragraph (b) must be the methodology that determines its risk-based capital ratios under ยง 217.10. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the risk-weighted asset amount for a private sector credit exposure that is a covered position under subpart F of this part is its specific risk add-on as determined under ยง 217.210 multiplied by 12.5.
