(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the principal amount of all debt instruments and the market value of all other interests that are functionally equivalent to equity that are controlled by the first company are added to the sum under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and the principal amount of all debt instruments and the market value of all other interests that are functionally equivalent to equity that are outstanding are added to Issuer Shareholders' Equity.

(3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a debt instrument issued by the second company may be considered functionally equivalent to equity if it has equity-like characteristics, such as:

(i) Extremely long-dated maturity;

(ii) Subordination to other debt instruments issued by the second company;

(ii) Qualification as regulatory capital under any regulatory capital rules applicable to the second company;

(iii) Qualification as equity under applicable tax law;
