### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Renewal.

1.This exception applies both to obligations with a single payment of principal and interest and to obligations with periodic payments of interest and a final payment of principal. In determining whether a new obligation replacing an old one is a renewal of the original terms or a refinancing, the creditor may consider it a renewal even if:

i. Accrued unpaid interest is added to the principal balance.

ii. Changes are made in the terms of renewal resulting from the factors listed in § 1026.17(c)(3).

iii. The principal at renewal is reduced by a curtailment of the obligation.
