## Chapter I - Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury
### PART 3 - CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS
#### Subpart D - Risk-Weighted Assets - Standardized Approach
##### Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures
###### § 3.43 Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) and the gross-up approach.
####### Gross-up approach,Applicability.

(e)-(1)A national bank or Federal savings association that is not subject to subpart F of this part may apply the gross-up approach set forth in this section instead of the SSFA to determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures, provided that it applies the gross-up approach to all of its securitization exposures, except as otherwise provided for certain securitization exposures in §§ 3.44 and 3.45.

(2) To use the gross-up approach, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the following four inputs:

(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;

(ii) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization resides;

(iii) Exposure amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure calculated under § 3.42(c); and

(iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this subpart.
