#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Unit-period.

4.Section 1026.37(o)(5)(i) provides that wherever form H-24 or § 1026.37 uses "monthly" to describe the frequency of any payments or uses "month" to describe the applicable unit-period, the creditor is required to substitute the appropriate term to reflect the fact that the transaction's terms provide for other than monthly periodic payments, such as bi-weekly or quarterly payments. For purposes of § 1026.37, the term "unit-period" has the same meaning as in appendix J to Regulation Z.
