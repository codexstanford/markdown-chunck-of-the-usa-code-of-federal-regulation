######## Protection purchaser,First-to-default credit derivatives.

(4)-(i)A System institution that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of ยง 628.36(b) must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the System institution synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. A System institution must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to ยง 628.34 for a first-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of ยง 628.36(b).
