###### Consumer asset account.

1.The term consumer asset account includes:

i. Club accounts, such as vacation clubs. In many cases, however, these accounts are exempt from the regulation under ยง 205.3(c)(5) because all electronic transfers to or from the account have been preauthorized by the consumer and involve another account of the consumer at the same institution.

ii. A retail repurchase agreement (repo), which is a loan made to a financial institution by a consumer that is collateralized by government or government-insured securities.
