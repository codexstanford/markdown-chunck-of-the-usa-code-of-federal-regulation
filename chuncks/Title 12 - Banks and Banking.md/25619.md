###### Purpose and scope.

(a)This section is intended to allow the deposit and other operations of a large insured depository institution (defined as a "Covered Institution") to continue functioning on the day following failure. It also is intended to permit the FDIC to fulfill its legal mandates regarding the resolution of failed insured institutions to provide liquidity to depositors promptly, enhance market discipline, ensure equitable treatment of depositors at different institutions and reduce the FDIC's costs by preserving the franchise value of a failed institution.
