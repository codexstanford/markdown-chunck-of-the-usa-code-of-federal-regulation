####### Operational criteria for credit risk transfers.

(c)For credit risk transfers, an Enterprise may recognize for risk-based capital purposes, the use of a credit risk transfer only if each condition in this paragraph (c) is satisfied (or, for a credit risk transfer entered into before February 16, 2021, only if each condition in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section is satisfied). An Enterprise that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the credit risk transfer. An Enterprise that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk transfer for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been subject to the credit risk transfer. The conditions are:

(1) The credit risk transfer is any of the following-

(i) An eligible funded synthetic risk transfer;

(ii) An eligible reinsurance risk transfer;

(iii) An eligible single-family lender risk share;

(iv) An eligible multifamily lender risk share; or

(v) An eligible senior-subordinated structure.

(2) The credit risk transfer has been approved by FHFA as effective in transferring the credit risk of one or more mortgage exposures to another party, taking into account any counterparty, recourse, or other risk to the Enterprise and any capital, liquidity, or other requirements applicable to counterparties;

(3) The Enterprise transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk transfer employed do not include provisions that:

(i) Allow for the termination of the credit risk transfer due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

(ii) Require the Enterprise to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

(iii) Increase the Enterprise's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the Enterprise in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or

(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the Enterprise after the inception of the credit risk transfer;

(4) The Enterprise obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk transfer in all relevant jurisdictions;

(5) Any clean-up calls relating to the credit risk transfer are eligible clean-up calls; and

(6) The Enterprise includes in its periodic disclosures under the Federal securities laws, or in other appropriate public disclosures, a reasonably detailed description of-

(i) The material recourse or other risks that might reduce the effectiveness of the credit risk transfer in transferring the credit risk on the underlying exposures to third parties; and

(ii) Each condition under paragraph (a) of this section (governing traditional securitizations) or paragraph (b) of this section (governing synthetic securitizations) that is not satisfied by the credit risk transfer and the reasons that each such condition is not satisfied.
