An exception is made, however, for State laws that allow the consumer to inquire about an account and require the creditor to respond to such inquiries beyond the time limits in the Federal law. Such a State law is not preempted with respect to the extra time period.

If a State law allows the consumer 90 days to submit a notice, the State law remains in effect to provide the extra 30 days. Any State law disclosures concerning this extended state time limit must reflect the qualifications and conform to the format specified in § 226.28(a)(2)(i). Examples of laws that would be preempted include:
