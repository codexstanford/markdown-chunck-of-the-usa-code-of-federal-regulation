## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### General rule.

1.Under § 1026.24(d)(1), whenever certain triggering terms appear in credit advertisements, the additional credit terms enumerated in § 1026.24(d)(2) must also appear. These provisions apply even if the triggering term is not stated explicitly but may be readily determined from the advertisement. For example, an advertisement may state "80 percent financing available," which is in fact indicating that a 20 percent downpayment is required.
