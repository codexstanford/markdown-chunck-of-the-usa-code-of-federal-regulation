###### Preemption determination-South Carolina.

12.Effective October 1, 1984, the Board has determined that the following provision in the State law of South Carolina is preempted by the Federal law.

- Section 37-10-102(c)-Disclosure of due-on-sale clause. This provision is preempted, but only to the extent that the creditor is required to include the disclosure with the segregated Federal disclosures. If the creditor may comply with the State law by placing the due-on-sale notice apart from the Federal disclosures, the state law is not preempted.
