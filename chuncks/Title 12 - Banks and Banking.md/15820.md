###### 1. Models C-12 through C-25 generally.

Models C-12 through C-25 provide models of the various notices required by the regulation. A bank that cashes a check and places a hold on funds in an account of the customer (see ยง 229.19(e)) should modify the model hold notice accordingly. For example, the bank could replace the word "deposit" with the word "transaction" and could add the phrase "or cashed" after the word "deposited."
