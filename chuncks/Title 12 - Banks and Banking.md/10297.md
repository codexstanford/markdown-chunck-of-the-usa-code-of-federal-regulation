###### ยง 220.128 Treatment of simultaneous long and short positions in the same margin account when put or call options or combinations thereof on such stock are also outstanding in the account.
####### contra

(g) A situation was also described in which a customer has purported to establish simultaneous offsetting long and short positions by executing a "cross" or wash sale of the security on the same day. In this situation, no change in the beneficial ownership of stock has taken place. Since there is no actual "" party to either transaction, and no stock has been borrowed or delivered to accomplish the short sale, such fictitious positions would have no value for purposes of the Board's margin regulations. Indeed, the adoption of such a scheme in connection with an overall strategy involving the issuance, endorsement, or guarantee of put or call options or combinations thereof appears to be manipulative and may have been employed for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of the regulations.
