###### Rent limitation.

(a)The gross rent limits for Affordable Housing are determined under the provisions in IRC section 42(g)(2). In this determination, if this part imposes an income restriction on a unit that is greater than 60 percent of area median income, adjusted for Family size, then the provisions of IRC section 42(g)(2) are applied as if that income restriction on the unit satisfied IRC section 42(g)(1). The maximum rent is a rent that does not exceed:

(1) For an Eligible-Income Family, 30 percent of the annual income of a Family whose annual income equals 120 percent of the area median income, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the unit, as set forth in IRC section 42(g)(2).
