###### Differences between fixed-rate and variable-rate accounts.

2.All accounts must either be fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts. Classifying an account as variable-rate affects credit unions three ways:

i. Additional account disclosures are required (ยง 707.4(b)(1)(ii));

ii. Rate decreases are exempted from change-in-terms requirements (ยง 707.5(a)(2)(i)); and

iii. Advertising notice required (ยง 707.8(c)(1)).

Fixed-rate accounts require a contract term obligating the credit union to a 30-day advance, written notice to members before decreasing the dividend rate on the account. Term changes adversely affecting the member and rate decreases cannot take effect until 30 days after such fixed-rate change-in-terms notices are mailed or delivered to members (ยง 707.5(a)).
