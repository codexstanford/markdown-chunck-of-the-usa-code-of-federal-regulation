The California law and regulations govern the availability of funds to "demand deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal draft accounts, savings deposits subject to automatic transfers, share draft accounts, and all savings deposits and share accounts, other than time deposits." (California Financial Code section 886(b)) The federal preemption of state funds availability laws only applies tosubject to Regulation CC, which generally includes transaction accounts. Thus, the California funds availability regulations continue to apply to deposits in savings and other accounts (such as accounts in which the account-holder is another bank) that are nounder Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under ยง 229.19(e) of Regulation CC,the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined asunder Regulation CC in certain circumstances.)
