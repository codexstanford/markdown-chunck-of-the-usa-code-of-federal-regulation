##### ยง 713.2 What are the responsibilities of a federally insured credit union's board of directors under this section?

(a) The board of directors of each federally insured credit union must at least annually review its fidelity and other insurance coverage to ensure that it is adequate in relation to the potential risks facing the federally insured credit union and the minimum requirements set by the NCUA Board; and

(b) The board of directors of each federally insured credit union must review all applications for purchase or renewal of its fidelity bond coverage.
