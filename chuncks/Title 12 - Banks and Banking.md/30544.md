###### Calculation.

(2)To use the gross-up approach, a credit union must calculate the following four inputs:

(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the credit union's exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;

(ii) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the credit union's securitization resides;

(iii) Exposure amount, which is the amortized cost for investments classified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale, and the fair value for trading securities; and

(iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this appendix.
