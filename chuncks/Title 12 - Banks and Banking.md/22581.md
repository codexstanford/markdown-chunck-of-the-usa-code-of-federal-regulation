######## Phase 1-Categorization.

(b)The FDIC-supervised institution must determine which of its exposures are wholesale exposures, retail exposures, securitization exposures, or equity exposures. The FDIC-supervised institution must categorize each retail exposure as a residential mortgage exposure, a QRE, or an other retail exposure. The FDIC-supervised institution must identify which wholesale exposures are HVCRE exposures, sovereign exposures, OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, eligible purchased wholesale exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions to which ยง 324.136 applies, and eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives that are used as credit risk mitigants. The FDIC-supervised institution must identify any on-balance sheet asset that does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, equity, or securitization exposure, as well as any non-material portfolio of exposures described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
