###### Model C-16 Case-by-case hold notice.

6.This model satisfies the notice required under ยง 229.16(c)(2) when a bank with a case-by-case hold policy imposes a hold on a deposit. This notice does not require a statement of the specific reason for the hold, as is the case when a ยง 229.13 exception hold is placed. A bank may specify the actual date when funds will be available for withdrawal rather than the number of the business day following the day of deposit when funds will be available. A bank must incorporate in the notice the material set out in brackets if it imposes overdraft fees after invoking a case-by-case hold.
