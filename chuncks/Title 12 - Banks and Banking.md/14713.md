###### Specific value or predetermined threshold.

2.As used in the examples of actions prohibited under ยง 226.42(c)(1), a "specific value" and a "predetermined threshold" include a predetermined minimum, maximum, or range of values. Further, although the examples assume a covered person's prohibited actions are designed to cause the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to equal or exceed a certain amount, the rule applies equally to cases where a covered person's prohibited actions are designed to cause the value assigned to the dwelling to be below a certain amount.
