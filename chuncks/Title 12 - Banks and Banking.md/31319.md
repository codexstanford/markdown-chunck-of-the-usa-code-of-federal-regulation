3.Within its sole discretion, the board of directors of a credit union may provide TISA disclosures to nonmembers who are ineligible for membership or to hold an account at the credit union. If disclosures are made to such nonmembers, it is the position of the Board that no civil liability can accrue to the credit union for any errors in such disclosures.
