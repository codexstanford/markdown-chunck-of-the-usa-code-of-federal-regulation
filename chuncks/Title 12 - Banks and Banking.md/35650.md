"A person with legal title to property generally has the right to own, use and enjoy the property. A contract to buy a lot may give you possession but doesn't give you legal title.

"Here we will discuss the sales contract you will sign and the deed you will receive. We will also provide you with information about any land use restrictions and encumbrances, mortgages, or liens affecting your lot and some important facts about payments, recording, and title insurance."

"The release provisions for the (indicate all or particular lots) have not been recorded. Therefore, they may not be honored by subsequent holders of the mortgage. If they are not honored, you may not be able to obtain clear title to a lot covered by this mortgage until we have paid the mortgage in full, even if you have paid the full purchase price of the lot. If we should default on the mortgage prior to obtaining a release of your lot, you may lose your lot and all monies paid."

"The (state type of encumbrance) on (indicate all or particular lots) in this subdivision does not contain any provisions for the release of an individual lot when the full purchase price of the lot has been paid. Therefore, if your lot is subject to this (state type of encumbrance), you may not be able to obtain clear title to your lot until we have paid the (state type of encumbrance) in full, even though you may have received a deed and paid the full purchase price of the lot. If we should default on the (state type of encumbrance) prior to obtaining a release, you may lose your lot and all monies paid."

"Unless your contract or deed is recorded you may lose your lot through the claims of subsequent purchasers or subsequent creditors of anyone having an interest in the land".

"You may lose your (indicate deposit, down payment and/or installment payments) on your lot if we fail to deliver legal title to you as called for in the contract, because (they are/it is) not held in an escrow account which fully protects you."

In addition to the purchase price of your lot, there are other expenditures which must be made.
