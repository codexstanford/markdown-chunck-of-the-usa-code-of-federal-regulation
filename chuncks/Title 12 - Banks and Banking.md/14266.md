###### Adjustment notices.

1.A creditor must disclose to the consumer the type of information that will be contained in subsequent notices of adjustments and when such notices will be provided. (See the commentary to ยง 226.20(c) regarding notices of adjustments.) For example, the disclosure might state, "You will be notified at least 25, but no more than 120, days before the due date of a payment at a new level. This notice will contain information about the index and interest rates, payment amount, and loan balance." In transactions where there may be interest rate adjustments without accompanying payment adjustments in a year, the disclosure might read, "You will be notified once each year during which interest rate adjustments, but no payment adjustments, have been made to your loan. This notice will contain information about the index and interest rates, payment amount, and loan balance."
