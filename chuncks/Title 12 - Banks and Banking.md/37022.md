##### Unreasonable basis.

2.For purposes of § 1024.35(b)(5), a servicer lacks a reasonable basis to impose fees that are not bona fide, such as:

i. A late fee for a payment that was not late;

ii. A charge imposed by a service provider for a service that was not actually rendered;

iii. A default property management fee for borrowers that are not in a delinquency status that would justify the charge; or

iv. A charge for force-placed insurance in a circumstance not permitted by § 1024.37.
