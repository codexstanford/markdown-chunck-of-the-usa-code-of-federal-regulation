######## Currency mismatch.

(f)(1) If an FDIC-supervised institution recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative that is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the following formula to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative: P= Px (1-H), where:

(i) Pequals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for currency mismatch (and maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable);

(ii) Pequals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable); and

(iii) Hequals haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch between the credit risk mitigant and the hedged exposure.

(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must set Hequal to 8 percent unless it qualifies for the use of and uses its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility based on a ten-business-day holding period and daily marking-to-market and remargining. An FDIC-supervised institution qualifies for the use of its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility if it qualifies for:

(i) The own-estimates haircuts in ยง 324.132(b)(2)(iii);

(ii) The simple VaR methodology in ยง 324.132(b)(3); or

(iii) The internal models methodology in ยง 324.132(d).
