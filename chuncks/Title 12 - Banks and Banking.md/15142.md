##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Relationship to other exceptions.

1.The de minimis exception is distinct from the private label credit card exception under ยง 226.58(c)(6) and the product testing exception under ยง 226.58(c)(7). The de minimis exception provides that a card issuer with fewer than 10,000 open credit card accounts is not required to submit any agreements to the Board, regardless of whether those agreements qualify for the private label credit card exception or the product testing exception. In contrast, the private label credit card exception and the product testing exception provide that a card issuer is not required to submit to the Board agreements offered solely in connection with certain types of credit card plans with fewer than 10,000 open accounts, regardless of the card issuer's total number of open accounts.
