17.This sample illustrates a mortgage with a demand feature. The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. The 15 days of interim interest ($294.34) is collected as a prepaid finance charge at the time of consummation of the loan (April 15, 1981). In calculating the disclosure amounts, the minor irregularities provision in § 1026.17(c)(4) has been used. The property insurance premiums are not included in the payment schedule. This disclosure statement could be used for notes with the 7-year call option required by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) in states where due-on-sale clauses are prohibited.
