### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Signature lines.

4.Section 1026.38(t) does not restrict the addition of signature lines to the disclosure required by § 1026.38, provided any signature lines for confirmations of receipt of the disclosure appear only under the "Confirm Receipt" heading required by § 1026.38(s) as illustrated by form H-25 of appendix H to this part. If the number of signatures requested by the creditor for confirming receipt of the disclosure requires space for signature lines in excess of that provided on form H-25, an additional page may be added to accommodate the additional signature lines with an appropriate reference to the additional page. Such additional page should also contain the heading and statement required by § 1026.38(s) in the format provided on form H-25. Signatures for a purpose other than confirming receipt of the form may be obtained on a separate page, and consistent with § 1026.38(t)(1)(i), not on the same page as the information required by § 1026.38.
