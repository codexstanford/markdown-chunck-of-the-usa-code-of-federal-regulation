(3)A Federal credit union must determine its indirect exposure by calculating its proportional ownership share of each exposure held in a fund, or similar indirect investment. The Federal credit union's exposure to the fund is equal to the exposure held by the fund as if they were held directly by the Federal credit union, multiplied by the Federal credit union's proportional ownership share of the fund.
