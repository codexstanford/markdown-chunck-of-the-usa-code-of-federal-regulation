###### Clients Added to an Agent Protocol Covered Document after the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter from the later of the Agent and the other Adhering Party to adhere.

(h)

(i) Subject to subparagraph 3(h)(ii) below, in respect of any Client added to an Agent Protocol Covered Document between an Agent and an Adhering Party after the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the Agent and the other Adhering Party to adhere (a New Client), the Agent and such Adhering Party agree that the terms of such Agent Protocol Covered Document as between such Adhering Party and any New Client will be subject to the amendments effected by this Protocol and as between the Adhering Party and the New Client the Implementation Date shall be the date on which the New Client is added to the Agent Protocol Covered Document, unless otherwise agreed between such Agent and such Adhering Party (which agreement may, if the Agent adheres to this Protocol using the approach in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above, be reached by the Agent communicating to the other Adhering Party through a Platform, at the time the New Client is added to the Agent Protocol Covered Document, that the New Client is excluded from adherence).

(ii) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol using the approach described in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B) above and therefore specifically names or identifies one or more Clients on whose behalf it is adhering, then in order for the terms of an Agent Protocol Covered Document as between an Adhering Party and any New Client to be subject to the amendments effected by this Protocol, the Agent shall communicate the identity of each New Client (including the legal entity identifier (LEI)) to the other Adhering Party which is a party to the Agent Protocol Covered Document to which the New Client is added through a Platform and, as between the other Adhering Party and that New Client, the Implementation Date shall be the date shown on the Platform as the date on which the Agent communicates the identity of that New Client to the other Adhering Party through that Platform.
