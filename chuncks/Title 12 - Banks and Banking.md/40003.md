#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Example-loan product changes.

ii.Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the disclosures provided under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) disclose a product required to be disclosed as a "Fixed Rate" that contains no features that may change the periodic payment.

A. On Thursday, June 11, the loan product required to be disclosed changes to a "5/1 Adjustable Rate." The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures and delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and any other changed terms, at least three business days before consummation. If, after the corrected disclosures in this example are provided, the loan product subsequently changes before consummation to a "3/1 Adjustable Rate," the creditor is required to provide additional corrected disclosures and again delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and any other changed terms, at least three business days before consummation.

B. On Thursday, June 11, the loan product required to be disclosed has changed to a "Fixed Rate" with a "Negative Amortization" feature. The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures and delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and any other changed terms, at least three business days before consummation.
