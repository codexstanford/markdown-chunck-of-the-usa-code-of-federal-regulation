###### Application date.

1.An application is deemed received when it reaches the creditor in any of the ways applications are normally transmitted. (See ยง 226.19(a).) For example, if a borrower applies for a 10-year loan on September 30 and the creditor counteroffers with a 7-year loan on October 10, the application is deemed received in September and the creditor must measure the annual percentage rate against the appropriate Treasury security yield as of August 15. An application transmitted through an intermediary agent or broker is received when it reaches the creditor, rather than when it reaches the agent or broker. (See comment 19(b)-3 to determine whether a transaction involves an intermediary agent or broker.)
