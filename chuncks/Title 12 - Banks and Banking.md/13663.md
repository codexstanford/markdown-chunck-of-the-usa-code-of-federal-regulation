##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Grace period.

1.A creditor may not disclose under ยง 226.9(b)(3)(i)(D) the limitations on the imposition of finance charges as a result of a loss of a grace period in ยง 226.54, or the impact of payment allocation on whether interest is charged on transactions as a result of a loss of a grace period. Some creditors may offer a grace period on credit extended by the use of an access check under which interest will not be charged on the check transactions if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement for one or more billing cycles. In these circumstances, ยง 226.9(b)(3)(i)(D) requires that the creditor disclose the grace period using the following language, or substantially similar language, as applicable: "Your due date is [at least] ____ days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on check transactions if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month." However, other creditors may offer a grace period on check transactions under which interest may be charged on check transactions even if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances, ยง 226.9(b)(3)(i)(D) requires the creditor to amend the above disclosure language to describe accurately the conditions on the applicability of the grace period. Creditors may use the following language to describe that no grace period on check transactions is offered, as applicable: "We will begin charging interest on these checks on the transaction date."
