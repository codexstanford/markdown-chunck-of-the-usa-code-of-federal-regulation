4.Credit unions may not require members to maintain both a minimum daily balance and a minimum average daily balance to earn dividends, such as by requiring the member to maintain a $500 daily balance and a prescribed average daily balance (whether higher or lower). But a credit union could offer a minimum balance to earn dividends that includes an additional method that is "unequivocally beneficial" to the member such as the following:

i. A credit union using the daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $500 minimum daily balance could choose to pay dividends on the account (for those days the minimum balance is not met) as long as the member maintained an average daily balance throughout the month of $400.

ii. A credit union using the average daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $400 minimum average daily balance could choose to pay dividends on the account as long as the member maintained a daily balance of $500 for at least half of the days in the period.

iii. A credit union using either the daily balance method or average daily balance method to calculate dividends that requires: (A) a $500 daily balance; or (B) a $400 average daily balance to pay dividends on the account.
