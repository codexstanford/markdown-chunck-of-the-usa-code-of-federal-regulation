#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Current and new interest rates.

1.The current interest rate is the interest rate that applies on the date of the disclosure. The new interest rate is the interest rate used to calculate the new payment and may be an estimate pursuant to § 1026.20(d)(2). The new payment, if calculated from an estimated new interest rate, will also be an estimate. The "new interest rate" has the same meaning as the "adjusted interest rate." The requirements of § 1026.20(d)(2)(iii)(A) do not preclude creditors, assignees, and servicers from rounding the interest rate, pursuant to the requirements of the ARM contract.
