### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Agreements amended but no longer offered to the public.

3.A card issuer should submit an amended agreement to the Bureau under § 1026.58(c)(3) only if the issuer offered the amended agreement to the public as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the amendment became effective. Agreements that are not offered to the public as of the last day of the calendar quarter should not be submitted to the Bureau. For example, on December 31 a card issuer offers two agreements, Agreement A and Agreement B. The issuer submits these agreements to the Bureau by January 31 as required by § 1026.58. On February 15, the issuer amends both Agreement A and Agreement B. On February 28, the issuer stops offering Agreement A to the public. On March 15, the issuer amends Agreement B a second time. As a result, on March 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter, the issuer offers to the public one agreement-Agreement B as amended on March 15. By the April 30 quarterly submission deadline, the issuer must (i) notify the Bureau that it is withdrawing Agreement A because Agreement A is no longer offered to the public; and (ii) submit to the Bureau Agreement B as amended on March 15. The issuer should not submit to the Bureau either Agreement A as amended on February 15 or the earlier version of Agreement B (as amended on February 15), as neither was offered to the public on March 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter.
