#### ยง 403.4 Derivative classification.
##### Use of derivative classification.

(a)(1) Unlike original classification which is an initial determination, derivative classification is an incorporation, paraphrasing, restatement, or generation in new form of information that is already classified. Derivative classification is the responsibility of those who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide. Original classification authority is not required for derivative classification.

(2) Persons who apply such derivative classification markings shall:

(i) Respect original classification decisions;

(ii) Verify the information's current level of classification so far as practicable before applying the markings; and

(iii) Carry forward to any newly created documents the assigned dates or events for declassification or review. The latest date for declassification should be entered in the case of multiple source documents.
