###### Events causing inaccuracies.

1.Inaccuracies in disclosures are not violations if attributable to events occurring after the disclosures are made. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the collateral insured and the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make the original disclosures inaccurate. The creditor may, however, be required to make new disclosures under ยง 226.17(f) or ยง 226.19 if the events occurred between disclosure and consummation or under ยง 226.20 if the events occurred after consummation.
