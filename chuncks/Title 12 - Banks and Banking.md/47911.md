##### Liquidity of the company's assets.

The second factor under the asset liquidation transmission channel is an analysis of the company's assets that the company could rapidly liquidate, if necessary, to satisfy its obligations. In particular, the Council expects that this assessment will focus on the size and liquidity characteristics of the company's investment portfolio. The Council will assess the company's assets, grouped into categories such as highly liquid (for example, cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities) and less-liquid (for example, corporate bonds, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, and mortgages and other loans) to determine if it holds cash instruments or readily marketable securities that could reasonably be expected to have a liquid market in times of broader market stress. To the extent that the company's assets are encumbered, those assets would generally not be considered to be available to satisfy short-term obligations.
