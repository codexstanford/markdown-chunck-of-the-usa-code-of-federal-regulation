###### Change in type of rate.

ii.If the rate increase subject to ยง 226.59 involves a change from a variable rate to a non-variable rate or from a non-variable rate to a variable rate, ยง 226.59 does not require that the issuer reinstate the same type of rate that applied prior to the change. However, the amount of any rate decrease that is required must be determined based upon the card issuer's reasonable policies and procedures under ยง 226.59(b) for consideration of factors described in ยง 226.59(a) and (d).
