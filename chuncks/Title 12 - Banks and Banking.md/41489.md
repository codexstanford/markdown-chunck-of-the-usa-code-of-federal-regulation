1.Under § 1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(A), a "standard mortgage" must provide for regular periodic payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (comment 43(e)(2)(i)-2), or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the loan amount over the loan term. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an explanation of the term "substantially equal," see comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not a "standard mortgage" because it does not require "regular periodic payments."comment 43(e)(2)(i)-1.
