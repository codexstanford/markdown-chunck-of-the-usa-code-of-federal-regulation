####### Failure of a QCCP to satisfy the rule's requirements.

(f)If an Enterprise determines that a CCP ceases to be a QCCP due to the failure of the CCP to satisfy one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (iii) of the definition of a "QCCP" in § 1240.2, the Enterprise may continue to treat the CCP as a QCCP for up to three months following the determination.
