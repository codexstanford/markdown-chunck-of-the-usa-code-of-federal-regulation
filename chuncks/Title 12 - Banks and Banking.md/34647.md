#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### Disclosures for prepaid accounts acquired by telephone.

1.Unless it provides disclosures in written form prior to acquisition pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), a financial institution must disclose the information required by § 1005.18(b)(2) and (5) orally before a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone pursuant to the exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii). A financial institution may, for example, provide these disclosures by using an interactive voice response or similar system or by using a customer service agent, after the consumer has initiated the purchase of a prepaid account by telephone, but before the consumer acquires the prepaid account. In addition, a financial institution must provide the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7, as modified by § 1005.18(f)(1), before the first electronic fund transfer is made involving the prepaid account.
