####### § 324.153 Internal models approach (IMA).
######## Risk-weighted assets calculation for an FDIC-supervised institution using the IMA only for publicly traded equity exposures.

(d)If an FDIC-supervised institution models only publicly traded equity exposures, the FDIC-supervised institution's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of:

(1) The risk-weighted asset amount of each equity exposure that qualifies for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under §§ 324.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i) (as determined under § 324.152), each equity exposure that qualifies for a 400 percent risk weight under § 324.152(b)(5) or a 600 percent risk weight under § 324.152(b)(6) (as determined under § 324.152), and each equity exposure to an investment fund (as determined under § 324.154); and

(2) The greater of:

(i) The estimate of potential losses on the FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposures (other than equity exposures referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) generated by the FDIC-supervised institution's internal equity exposure model multiplied by 12.5; or

(ii) The sum of:

(A) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the FDIC-supervised institution's publicly traded equity exposures that do not belong to a hedge pair, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under § 324.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund; and

(B) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate ineffective portion of all hedge pairs.
