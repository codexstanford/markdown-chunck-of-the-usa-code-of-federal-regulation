###### ยง 324.208 Incremental risk.
####### General requirement.

(a)An FDIC-supervised institution that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under ยง 324.207(b) using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the FDIC-supervised institution's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the FDIC, an FDIC-supervised institution may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the FDIC-supervised institution internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position. An FDIC-supervised institution may not include correlation trading positions or securitization positions in its incremental risk measure.
