###### § 1240.41 Operational requirements for CRT and other securitization exposures.
####### Due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.

(d)(1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to § 1240.42(h), if an Enterprise is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of FHFA a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the Enterprise must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent. The Enterprise's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.

(2) An Enterprise must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:

(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:

(A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the exposure, and deal-specific definitions of default;

(B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);

(C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spread, most recent sales price and historic price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and

(D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and

(ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure.
