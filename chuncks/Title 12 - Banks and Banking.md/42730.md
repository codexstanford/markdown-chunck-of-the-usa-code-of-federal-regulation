##### Initiating a transfer of money from a consumer's account.

1.A lender or service provider obtains the ability to initiate a transfer of money when that person can collect payment, or otherwise withdraw funds, from a consumer's account, either on a single occasion or on a recurring basis, without the consumer taking further action. Generally, when a lender or service provider has the ability to "pull" funds or initiate a transfer from the consumer's account, that person has a leveraged payment mechanism. However, a "push" transaction from the consumer to the lender or service provider does not in itself give the lender or service provider a leveraged payment mechanism.
