i. Under a closed-end commitment, the creditor might agree to lend a total of $10,000 in a series of advances as needed by the consumer. When a consumer has borrowed the full $10,000, no more is advanced under that particular agreement, even if there has been repayment of a portion of the debt. (§ 1026.2(a)(17)(iv) for disclosure requirements when a credit card is used to obtain the advances.)
