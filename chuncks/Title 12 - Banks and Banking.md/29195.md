###### Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures
####### ยง 628.41 Operational requirements for securitization exposures.
######## Operational criteria for traditional securitizations.

(a)A System institution that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each condition in this section is satisfied. A System institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization. A System institution that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from CET1 capital, pursuant to ยง 628.22, any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:

(1) The exposures are not reported on the System institution's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;

(2) The System institution has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;

(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and

(4) The securitization does not:

(i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and

(ii) Contain an early amortization provision.
