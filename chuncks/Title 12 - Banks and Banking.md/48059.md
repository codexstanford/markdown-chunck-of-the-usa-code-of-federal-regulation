##### Nonaccrual loan

(g)(1)means any loan where-

(i) Any amount of outstanding principal and all past and future interest accruals, considered over the full term of the asset, are determined to be uncollectible for any reason; or,

(ii) It has been classified "loss" as a result of a periodic credit evaluation and has not been charged off; or,

(iii) The loan is severely past due and is not adequately secured, in process of collection, and fully collectible with respect to all principal and interest.

(2) For the purposes of determining whether a loan is considered as accrual or nonaccrual under this part, all loans on which a borrowing entity, or a component of a borrowing entity, is primarily obligated to the institution shall be considered as one loan unless a review of all pertinent facts supports a reasonable determination that a particular loan constitutes an independent credit risk and such determination is adequately documented in the loan file.
