####### 2020 CECL transition provision.

(d)Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a Board-regulated institution that adopts CECL for accounting purposes under GAAP as of the first day of a fiscal year that begins during the 2020 calendar year may elect to use the transitional amounts and modified transitional amounts in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with the 2020 CECL transition provision calculation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to adjust its calculation of regulatory capital ratios during each quarter of the transition period in which a Board-regulated institution uses CECL for purposes of its Call Report or FR Y-9C. A Board-regulated institution may use the transition provision in this paragraph (d) if it has a positive modified CECL transitional amount during any quarter ending in 2020, and makes the election in the Call Report or FR Y-9C filed for the same quarter. A Board-regulated institution that does not calculate a positive modified CECL transitional amount in any quarter is not required to apply the adjustments in its calculation of regulatory capital ratios in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in that quarter.
