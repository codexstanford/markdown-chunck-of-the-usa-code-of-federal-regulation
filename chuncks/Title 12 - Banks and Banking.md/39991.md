##### Timeshares.

3.For transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan described in 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) requires a creditor to ensure that the consumer receives the disclosures required under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later than consummation. Timeshare transactions covered by § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) may be consummated at the time or any time after the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) are received by the consumer. For example, if a consumer provides the creditor with an application, as defined by § 1026.2(a)(3), for a mortgage loan secured by a timeshare on Monday, June 1, and consummation of the timeshare transaction is scheduled for Friday, June 5, the creditor complies with § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) by ensuring that the consumer receives the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later than consummation on Friday, June 5. If a consumer provides the creditor with an application for a mortgage loan secured by a timeshare on Monday, June 1 and consummation of the timeshare transaction is scheduled for Tuesday, June 2, then the creditor complies with § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) by ensuring that the consumer receives the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later than consummation on Tuesday, June 2. In some cases, a Loan Estimate must be provided under § 1026.19(e) before provision of the Closing Disclosure. See comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-4 for guidance on providing the Loan Estimate for transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan.
