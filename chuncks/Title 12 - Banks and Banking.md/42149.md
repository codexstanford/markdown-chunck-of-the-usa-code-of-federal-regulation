2.For the exception in § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D) to apply, under § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D)(), the prepaid account issuer must not vary the terms, conditions, and features on the consumer's prepaid account depending on whether the consumer has authorized linking the prepaid card to the credit card account as described in § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D)(). For example, a prepaid account issuer would not satisfy this condition of § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D)() if it provides on a consumer's prepaid account rewards points or cash back on purchases with the prepaid card where the consumer has authorized a link to the credit card account as discussed above while not providing such rewards points or cash back on the consumer's account if the consumer has not authorized such a linkage.
