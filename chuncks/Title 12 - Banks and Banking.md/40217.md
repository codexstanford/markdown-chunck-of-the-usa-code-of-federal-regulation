## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Rules for other fair credit billing provisions.

6.The second part of the criteria for fair credit billing relates to the other rules implementing chapter 4 of the Act (addressed in §§ 1026.4(c)(8), 1026.5(b)(2)(ii), 1026.6(a)(5) and (b)(5)(iii), 1026.7(a)(9) and (b)(9), 1026.9(a), 1026.10, 1026.11, 1026.12(c) through (f), 1026.13, and 1026.21). Section 1026.28(a)(2)(ii) provides that the test of inconsistency is whether the creditor can comply with state law without violating Federal law. For example:

i. A state law that allows the card issuer to offset the consumer's credit-card indebtedness against funds held by the card issuer would be preempted, since § 1026.12(d) prohibits such action.

ii. A state law that requires periodic statements to be sent more than 14 days before the end of a free-ride period would not be preempted.

iii. A state law that permits consumers to assert claims and defenses against the card issuer without regard to the $50 and 100-mile limitations of § 1026.12(c)(3)(ii) would not be preempted.

iv. In paragraphs ii. and iii. of this comment, compliance with state law would involve no violation of the Federal law.
