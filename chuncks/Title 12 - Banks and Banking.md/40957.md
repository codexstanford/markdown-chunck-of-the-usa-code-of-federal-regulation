### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Statements and references regarding the total loan costs and total other costs.

1.Under § 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), the statements under the subheading "Did this change?" that the consumer should see the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under § 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5) is made only if and to the extent the difference in the "Total Closing Costs" is attributable to differences in itemized charges that are included in either or both of such subtotals.

i. For example, if an increase in the "Total Closing Costs" is attributable only to an increase in the appraisal fee (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading "Services Borrower Did Not Shop For," itself under the heading "Loan Costs"), then a statement is given under the subheading "Did this change?" that the consumer should see the total loan costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under § 1026.38(f)(4). If the increase in "Total Closing Costs" is attributable only to an increase in recording fees (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading "Taxes and Other Government Fees," itself under the heading "Other Costs"), then a statement is given under the subheading "Did this change?" that the consumer should see the total other costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under § 1026.38(g)(5). If, however, the increase is attributable in part to an increase in the appraisal fee and in part to an increase in the recording fee, then a statement is given under the subheading "Did this change?" that the consumer should see the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under § 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5).

ii. For guidance regarding the requirement that this statement be accompanied by a reference to the disclosures of the total loan costs and total other costs under § 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5), see comment 38(i)-1. For an example of such reference, see form H-25 of appendix H to this part.
