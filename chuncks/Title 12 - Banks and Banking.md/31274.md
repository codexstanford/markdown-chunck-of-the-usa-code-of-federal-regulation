2.Examples of accountssubject to the regulation are:

i. Mortgage escrow accounts for collecting taxes and property insurance premiums.

ii. Accounts established to make periodic disbursements on construction loans.

iii. Trust accounts opened by a trustee pursuant to a formal written trust agreement (not merely declarations of trust on a signature card such as a "Totten trust," or an IRA or SEP account).

iv. Accounts opened by an executor in the name of decedent's estate.

v. Accounts of individuals operating businesses as sole proprietors.

vi. Certificates of indebtedness. Some credit unions borrow funds from their members through a certificate of indebtedness that sets forth the terms and conditions of the repayment of the borrowing, such as federal credit unions do through 12 CFR 701.38. Such an account does not represent an account in a credit union and is not covered by part 707.

vii. Unincorporated nonbusiness association accounts.
