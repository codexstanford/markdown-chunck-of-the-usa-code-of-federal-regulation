###### Composite Financial Institution Rating System (FIRS) rating

(c)means the composite numerical assessment of the financial condition of an institution assigned to the institution by the FCA based on its most recent examination of the institution.

The composite FIRS rating ranges from 1 to 5, with a lower number indicating a better financial condition than a higher number.
