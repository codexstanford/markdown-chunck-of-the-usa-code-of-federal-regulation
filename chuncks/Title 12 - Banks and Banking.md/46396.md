(a)(1) When a vacancy occurs on the board of directors of any Bank, the board of directors of the Bank shall elect, by a majority vote of the remaining Bank directors sitting as a board, an individual to fill the unexpired term of office of the vacant directorship, regardless of whether the remaining Bank directors constitute a quorum of the Bank's board of directors.

(2) The board of directors of the Bank may fill an anticipated vacancy prior to the effective date of the vacancy, provided the board does so no sooner than the date of the regularly scheduled board meeting that occurs immediately prior to the effective date of the vacancy.

(3) The board of directors shall elect only an individual who satisfies all the eligibility requirements in the Bank Act and in this subpart that applied to his or her predecessor and, for independent directorships, also satisfies any of the qualifications in the Bank Act or this subpart. If a Bank does not have at least two sitting public interest independent directors, the board of directors of the Bank shall designate the directorship as a public interest directorship and shall elect an individual who satisfies a public interest independent directorship qualification in the Bank Act or in this subpart.
