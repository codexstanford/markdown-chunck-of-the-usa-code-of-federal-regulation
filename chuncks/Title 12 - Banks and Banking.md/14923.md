###### Rounding to nearest whole dollar.

2.A card issuer may round any fee that complies with ยง 226.52(b) to the nearest whole dollar. For example, if ยง 226.52(b) permits a card issuer to impose a late payment fee of $21.50, the card issuer may round that amount up to the nearest whole dollar and impose a late payment fee of $22. However, if the late payment fee permitted by ยง 226.52(b) were $21.49, the card issuer would not be permitted to round that amount up to $22, although the card issuer could round that amount down and impose a late payment fee of $21.
