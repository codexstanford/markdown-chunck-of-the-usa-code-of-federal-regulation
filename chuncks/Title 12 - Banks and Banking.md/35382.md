##### For Compensation or Gain.

(c)(1) An individual acts "for compensation or gain" within the meaning of § 1008.103(c)(2)(ii) if the individual receives or expects to receive in connection with the individual's activities anything of value, including, but not limited to, payment of a salary, bonus, or commission. The concept "anything of value" is interpreted broadly and is not limited only to payments that are contingent upon the closing of a loan.

(2) An individual does not act "for compensation or gain" if the individual acts as a volunteer without receiving or expecting to receive anything of value in connection with the individual's activities.
