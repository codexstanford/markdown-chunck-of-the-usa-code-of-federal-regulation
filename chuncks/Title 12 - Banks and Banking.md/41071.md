3.The modification permitted by § 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(B) allows the information required by § 1026.38(f) through (h) to be disclosed over two pages, numbered as "2a" and "2b." For an example of such a modification, see form H-25(H) of appendix H to this part. Under this modification, the information required by § 1026.38(h) must remain on the same page as the information required by § 1026.38(g). Accordingly, the Loan Costs section of form H-25 may appear on its own page "2a," but the Other Costs section must appear on the same page as the Total Closing Costs section on page "2b." The modifications permitted by § 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) may be used in conjunction to ensure disclosure of § 1026.38(f) on one page and § 1026.38(g) and (h) on a separate page.
