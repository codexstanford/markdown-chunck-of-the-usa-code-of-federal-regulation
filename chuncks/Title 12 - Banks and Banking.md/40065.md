### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Timing and form of initial rate adjustment.

3.The requirement that § 1026.20(d) disclosures be provided in writing, separate and distinct from all other correspondence, means that the initial ARM interest rate adjustment notice must be provided to consumers as a separate document but may, in the case of mailing the disclosure, be in the same envelope with other material and, in the case of emailing the disclosure, be a separate attachment from other attachments in the same email. The requirement that the disclosures be provided to consumers between 210 and 240 days "before the first payment at the adjusted level is due" means the creditor, assignee, or servicer must deliver the notice or place it in the mail between 210 and 240 days prior to the due date, excluding any grace or courtesy periods, of the first payment calculated using the adjusted interest rate.
