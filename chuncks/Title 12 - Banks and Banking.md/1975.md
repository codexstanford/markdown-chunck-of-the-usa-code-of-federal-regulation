###### Voting securities

(14)means:

(i) Shares of stock, if the shares or interests, by statute, charter, or in any manner, allow the holder to vote for or select directors (or persons exercising similar functions) of the issuing national bank or Federal savings association, or to vote on or to direct the conduct of the operations or other significant policies of the issuing national bank or Federal savings association. However, preferred stock or similar interests are not voting securities if:

(A) Any voting rights associated with the shares or interests are limited solely to voting rights customarily provided by statute regarding matters that would significantly affect the rights or preference of the security or other interest. This includes the issuance of additional amounts of classes of senior securities, the modification of the terms of the security or interest, the dissolution of the issuing national bank, or the payment of dividends by the issuing national bank or Federal savings association when preferred dividends are in arrears;

(B) The shares or interests are a passive investment or financing device and do not otherwise provide the holder with control over the issuing national bank or Federal savings association; and

(C) The shares or interests do not allow the holder by statute, charter, or in any manner, to select or to vote for the selection of directors (or persons exercising similar functions) of the issuing national bank or Federal savings association.

(ii) Securities, other instruments, or similar interests that are immediately convertible, at the option of the owner or holder thereof, into voting securities.
