##### Disclosures in programs combining debt cancellation and debt suspension features.

4.If the consumer's debt can be cancelled under certain circumstances, the disclosure may be modified to reflect that fact. The disclosure could, for example, state (in addition to the language required by § 1026.4(d)(3)(iii)) that "In some circumstances, my debt may be cancelled." However, the disclosure would not be permitted to list the specific events that would result in debt cancellation.
