(b) The debt arises under a contract as set forth inv.995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993); or

(c) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets, the Bureau first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity to review. When prior notice and an opportunity to review are omitted, the Director shall give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to be due to the U.S. Government.
