###### Regular periodic payments.,see

1.Under ยง 226.43(b)(7)(ii), the regular periodic payments on the refinance loan must not: result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization); allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (12 CFR 1026.43 and the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment 43(e)(2)(i)-2); or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the loan amount over the loan term. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an explanation of the term "substantially equal," see 12 CFR 1026.43 and the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not a refinancing meeting the requirements of ยง 226.43(b)(7) because it does not require "regular periodic payments."
