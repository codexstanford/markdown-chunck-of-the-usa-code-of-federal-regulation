###### Offering products with off-tenor maturities.

(e)If an institution seeks to offer a product with an off-tenor maturity for which the FDIC does not publish the national rate cap or that is not offered by another institution within its local market area, then the institution will be required to use the rate offered on the next lower on-tenor maturity for that product when determining its applicable national or local rate cap, respectively. For example, an institution seeking to offer a 26-month certificate of deposit must use the rate offered for a 24-month certificate of deposit to determine the institution's applicable national or local rate cap. There is no off-tenor maturity for nonmaturity products such as an interest checking account, savings account, or money market deposit account.
