###### Length of the period.

6.Credit unions must disclose the length of both the dividend period (or average daily balance calculation period) and the statement period. For example, a statement could disclose a statement period of April 16 through May 15 and further state that "the dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned are based on your dividend period (or average daily balance) for the period April 1 through April 30."
