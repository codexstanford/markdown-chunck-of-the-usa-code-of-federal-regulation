#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Fixed-rate conversion loans.

i.If a loan program permits consumers to convert their variable-rate loans to fixed rate loans, the creditor need not assume that the fixed-rate conversion option, by itself, means that more than one simple annual rate of interest will apply to the loan under § 1026.24(f)(2) and need not disclose as a separate payment under § 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A) the payment that would apply if the consumer exercised the fixed-rate conversion option.
