## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Credits from any party other than the seller or creditor.

1.Section 1026.38(j)(2)(vi) requires disclosure of a description and the amount of items paid by or on behalf of the consumer and not disclosed elsewhere under § 1026.38(j)(2). For example, credits a consumer receives from a real estate agent or other third party, other than a seller or creditor, are disclosed pursuant to § 1026.38(j)(2)(vi). However, if the credit is attributable to a specific closing cost listed in the Closing Cost Details tables under § 1026.38(f) or (g), that amount should be reflected in the paid by others column on the Closing Cost Details tables and not in the disclosure required under § 1026.38(j)(2)(vi). Similarly, if a real estate agent rebates a portion of the agent's commission to the consumer, the rebate should be listed as a credit along with a description of the rebate, which must include the name of the party giving the credit.
