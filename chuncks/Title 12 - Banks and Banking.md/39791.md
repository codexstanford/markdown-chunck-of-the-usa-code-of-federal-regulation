#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Relationship to payment schedule disclosures.

3.As provided in § 1026.18(g)(1), in demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the creditor need only disclose the due dates or payment periods of any scheduled interest payments for the first year. If the demand obligation states an alternate maturity, however, the disclosed payment schedule must reflect that stated term; the special rule in § 1026.18(g)(1) is not available.
