(l)--(1)An FDIC-supervised institution must determine a risk weight using the supervisory formula approach (SFA) pursuant to ยง 324.143 or the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) pursuant to ยง 324.144 for an nth-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (l). In the case of credit protection sold, an FDIC-supervised institution must determine its exposure in the n-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.

(2) For purposes of determining the risk weight for an n-to-default credit derivative using the SFA or the SSFA, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:

(i) The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of using the SFA to calculate the risk weight for its exposure in an n-to-default credit derivative, parameter A must be set equal to the credit enhancement level (L) input to the SFA formula. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) risk-weighted asset amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure.

(ii) The detachment point (parameter D) equals the sum of parameter A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure in the n-to-default credit derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of the SFA, parameter D must be set to equal L plus the thickness of tranche T input to the SFA formula.

(3) An FDIC-supervised institution that does not use the SFA or the SSFA to determine a risk weight for its exposure in an n-to-default credit derivative must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.
