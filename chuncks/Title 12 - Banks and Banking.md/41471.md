##### Higher-priced covered transaction with a balloon payment.

5.Where a loan with a balloon payment is a higher-priced covered transaction, the creditor must determine the consumer's repayment ability based on the loan's payment schedule, including any balloon payment. For example (all amounts are rounded): Assume a higher-priced covered transaction with a fixed interest rate of 7 percent. The loan amount is $200,000 and the loan has a ten year loan term, but is amortized over 30 years. The monthly payment scheduled for the first ten years is $1,331, with a balloon payment of $172,955. For purposes of § 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must consider the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on the payment schedule that fully repays the loan amount, including the balloon payment of $172,955.
