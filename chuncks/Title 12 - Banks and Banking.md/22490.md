######## Non-DvP/non-PvP (non-delivery-versus-payment/non-payment-versus-payment) transactions.

(e)(1) An FDIC-supervised institution must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the FDIC-supervised institution has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The FDIC-supervised institution must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the FDIC-supervised institution has received its corresponding deliverables.

(2) From the business day after the FDIC-supervised institution has made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the transaction by treating the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the FDIC-supervised institution as an exposure to the counterparty and using the applicable counterparty risk weight under this subpart D.

(3) If the FDIC-supervised institution has not received its deliverables by the fifth business day after counterparty delivery was due, the FDIC-supervised institution must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the FDIC-supervised institution.
