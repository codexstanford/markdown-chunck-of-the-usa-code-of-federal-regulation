If a transaction structured as a closed-end reverse mortgage transaction allows recourse against the consumer, and the annual percentage rate or the points and fees exceed those specified under ยง 226.32(a)(1), the transaction is subject to all the requirements of ยง 226.32, including the limitations concerning balloon payments and negative amortization.
