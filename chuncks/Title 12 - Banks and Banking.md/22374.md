(e)(1) An FDIC-supervised institution must receive FDIC prior approval to include a capital element (as listed in this section) in its common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital unless the element:

(i) Was included in an FDIC-supervised institution's tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010, in accordance with the FDIC's risk-based capital rules that were effective as of that date and the underlying instrument may continue to be included under the criteria set forth in this section; or

(ii) Is equivalent, in terms of capital quality and ability to absorb losses with respect to all material terms, to a regulatory capital element the FDIC determined may be included in regulatory capital pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

(2) When considering whether an FDIC-supervised institution may include a regulatory capital element in its common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, the FDIC will consult with the OCC and the Federal Reserve.

(3) After determining that a regulatory capital element may be included in an FDIC-supervised institution's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, the FDIC will make its decision publicly available, including a brief description of the material terms of the regulatory capital element and the rationale for the determination.
