##### Business days.

1.For purposes of providing reverse mortgage disclosures, "business day" has the same meaning as in comment 31(c)(1)-1-all calendar days except Sundays and the Federal legal holidays listed in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). This means if disclosures are provided on a Friday, consummation could occur any time on Tuesday, the third business day following receipt of the disclosures.
