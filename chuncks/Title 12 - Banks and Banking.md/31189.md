###### Third tier.

The credit union will pay $1,183.61 in dividends on a $20,000 account balance. Thus, using the simple formula, the annual percentage yield for the third tier is 5.92%:

Under this method, a credit union pays the stated dividend rate only on that portion of the balance within the specified tier. For example, if a member deposits $8,000, the credit union pays 5.25% on only $2,500 and 5.50% on $5,500 (the difference between $8,000 and the first tier cutoff of $2,500). This is also known as a "pure" tiered rate account.
