#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### General.

1.For purposes of § 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), a creditor must determine the consumer's ability to repay the covered transaction using the payment calculation methods set forth in § 1026.43(c)(5). The payment calculation methods differ depending on the type of credit extended. The payment calculation method set forth in § 1026.43(c)(5)(i) applies to any covered transaction that does not have a balloon payment, or that is not an interest-only or negative amortization loan, whether such covered transaction is a fixed-rate, adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage. The terms "fixed-rate mortgage," "adjustable-rate mortgage," "step-rate mortgage," "interest-only loan" and "negative amortization loan" are defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(iii), (i), (ii), (iv) and (v), respectively. For the meaning of the term "balloon payment," see § 1026.18(s)(5)(i). The payment calculation methods set forth in § 1026.43(c)(5)(ii) apply to any covered transaction that is a loan with a balloon payment, interest-only loan, or negative amortization loan. See comment 43(c)(5)(i)-5 and the commentary to § 1026.43(c)(5)(ii), which provide examples for calculating the monthly payment for purposes of the repayment ability determination required under § 1026.43(c)(2)(iii).
