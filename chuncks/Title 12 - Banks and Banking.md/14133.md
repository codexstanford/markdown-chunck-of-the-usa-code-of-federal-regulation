###### Relationship to payment schedule disclosures.

3.As provided in ยง 226.18(g)(1), in demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the creditor need only disclose the due dates or payment periods of any scheduled interest payments for the first year. If the demand obligation states an alternate maturity, however, the disclosed payment schedule must reflect that stated term; the special rule in ยง 226.18(g)(1) is not available.
