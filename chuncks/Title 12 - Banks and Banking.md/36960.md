##### Your credit or charge (points) for the specific interest rate chosen.

Block 2, ""-For transactions involving mortgage brokers, the mortgage broker must indicate through check boxes whether there is a credit to the borrower for the interest rate chosen on the loan, the interest rate, and the amount of the credit, or whether there is an additional charge (points) to the borrower for the interest rate chosen on the loan, the interest rate, and the amount of that charge. Only one of the boxes may be checked; a credit and charge cannot occur together in the same transaction.

For transactions without a mortgage broker, the lender may choose not to separately disclose in this block any credit or charge for the interest rate chosen on the loan; however, if this block does not include any positive or negative figure, the lender must check the first box to indicate that "The credit or charge for the interest rate you have chosen" is included in "Our origination charge" above (see Block 1 instructions above), must insert the interest rate, and must also insert "0" in Block 2. Only one of the boxes may be checked; a credit and charge cannot occur together in the same transaction.
