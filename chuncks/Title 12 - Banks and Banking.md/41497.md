#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Non-standard mortgage loan made in accordance with ability-to-repay or qualified mortgage requirements.

1.For non-standard mortgages that are consummated on or after January 10, 2014, § 1026.43(d)(2)(vi) provides that the refinancing provisions set forth in § 1026.43(d) apply only if the non-standard mortgage was made in accordance with the requirements of § 1026.43(c) or (e), as applicable. For example, if a creditor originated a non-standard mortgage on or after January 10, 2014 that did not comply with the requirements of § 1026.43(c) and was not a qualified mortgage pursuant to § 1026.43(e), § 1026.43(d) would not apply to the refinancing of the non-standard mortgage loan into a standard mortgage loan. However, § 1026.43(d) applies to the refinancing of a non-standard mortgage loan into a standard mortgage loan, regardless of whether the non-standard mortgage loan was made in compliance with § 1026.43(c) or (e), if the non-standard mortgage loan was consummated prior to January 10, 2014.
