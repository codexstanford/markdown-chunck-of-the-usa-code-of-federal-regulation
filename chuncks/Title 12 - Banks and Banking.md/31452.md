###### Specific account services.

6.Credit unions may advertise a specific account service or feature as free as long as no fee is imposed for that service or feature. For example, credit unions offering an account that is free of deposit or withdrawal fees could advertise that fact, as long as the advertisement does not mislead members by implying that the account is free and that no other fee (a monthly service fee, for example) may be charged.
