##### Comparisons in advertisements.

1.The requirements of § 1026.24(i)(2) apply to all advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling, including radio and television advertisements. A comparison includes a claim about the amount a consumer may save under the advertised product. For example, a statement such as "save $300 per month on a $300,000 loan" constitutes an implied comparison between the advertised product's payment and a consumer's current payment.
