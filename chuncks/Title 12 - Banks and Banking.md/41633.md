## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Form of disclosures-relation to other sections.

1.Creditors must make the disclosures required under this subpart in accordance with § 1026.46(c). Section 1026.46(c)(2) requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else. In complying with this requirement, creditors may follow the rules in § 1026.17, except where specifically provided otherwise. For example, although § 1026.17(b) requires creditors to provide only one set of disclosures before consummation of the transaction, §§ 1026.47(b) and (c) require that the creditor provide the disclosures under § 1026.18 both upon approval and after the consumer accepts the loan.
