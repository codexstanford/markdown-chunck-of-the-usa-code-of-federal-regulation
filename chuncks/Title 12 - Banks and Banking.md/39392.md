##### Determination.

1.Whether a substantial decrease in coverage will result from the change in provider is determined by the two-part test in § 1026.9(f)(3): First, whether the decrease is in a significant term of coverage; and second, whether the decrease might reasonably be expected to affect a cardholder's decision to continue the insurance. If both conditions are met, the decrease must be disclosed in the notice.
