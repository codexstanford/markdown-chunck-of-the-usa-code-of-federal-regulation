###### Examples.

i.This section covers open-end credit plans under which rate changes are specifically set forth in the account agreement and are tied to an index or formula. A creditor would use variable-rate disclosures for plans involving rate changes such as the following:

A. Rate changes that are tied to the rate the creditor pays on its six-month certificates of deposit.

B. Rate changes that are tied to Treasury bill rates.

C. Rate changes that are tied to changes in the creditor's commercial lending rate.

ii. An open-end credit plan in which the employee receives a lower rate contingent upon employment (that is, with the rate to be increased upon termination of employment) is not a variable-rate plan.
