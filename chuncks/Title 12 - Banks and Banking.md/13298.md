###### Rate based on another rate on the account.,See

7.In some cases, one rate may be based on another rate on the account. For example, assume that a penalty rate as described in ยง 226.5a(b)(1)(iv)(A) is determined by adding 5 percentage points to the current purchase rate, which is 10 percent. In this example, the card issuer in disclosing the penalty rate must disclose 15 percent as the current penalty rate. If the purchase rate is a variable rate, then the penalty rate also is a variable rate. In that case, the card issuer also must disclose the fact that the penalty rate may vary and how the rate is determined, such as "This APR may vary with the market based on the Prime Rate." In describing the penalty rate, the issuer shall not disclose in the table the amount of the margin or spread added to the current purchase rate to determine the penalty rate, such as describing that the penalty rate is determined by adding 5 percentage points to the purchase rate. (ยง 226.5a(b)(1)(i) and comment 5a(b)(1)-2 for further guidance on describing a variable rate.)
