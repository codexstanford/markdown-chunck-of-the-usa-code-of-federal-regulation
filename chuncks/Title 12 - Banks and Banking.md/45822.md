###### § 1240.34 Multifamily mortgage exposures.
####### Loan groups.

(3)If a multifamily property that secures a multifamily mortgage exposure also secures one or more supplemental mortgage exposures:

(i) A multifamily mortgage exposure-specific base risk weight must be determined under paragraph (c) of this section using for each of these multifamily mortgage exposures a single DSCR and single LTV, both calculated as if all of the multifamily mortgage exposures secured by the multifamily property were consolidated into a single multifamily mortgage exposure; and

(ii) A multifamily mortgage exposure-specific combined risk multiplier must be determined under paragraph (d) of this section based on the risk characteristics of the multifamily mortgage exposure (except with respect to the loan size multiplier, which would be determined using the aggregate unpaid principal balance of these multifamily mortgage exposures).
