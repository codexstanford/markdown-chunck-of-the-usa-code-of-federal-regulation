(b)If an advertisement states a rate of return, it shall state the rate as an "annual percentage yield," using that term. (The abbreviation "APY" may be used provided the term "annual percentage yield" is stated at least once in the advertisement.) The advertisement shall not state any other rate, except that the "dividend rate," using that term, may be stated in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the annual percentage yield to which it relates.
