#### PART 229 - AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND COLLECTION OF CHECKS (REGULATION CC)
##### Appendix F to Part 229 - Official Board Interpretations; Preemption Determinations
###### Temporary schedule.

The time periods for the availability of in-state nonlocal checks, contained in part 34.4 (a)(2) and (b)(2), are shorter that the seventh business day availability required for nonlocal checks under ยง 229.11(c) of Regulation CC, although they are not necessarily shorter than the schedules for nonlocal checks set forth in ยง 229.11(c)(2) and appendix B-1 of Regulation CC. Thus, these state schedules supersede the federal schedule to the extent that they apply to an item payable by a New York bank or savings institution that is defined as a nonlocal checks under Regulation CC and the applicable state schedule is less than the applicable schedule specified in ยง 229.11(c) and appendix B-1.
