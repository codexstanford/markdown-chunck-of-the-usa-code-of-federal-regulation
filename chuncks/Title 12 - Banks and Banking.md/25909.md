20.The notice of termination required by § 363.3(c) should state whether the independent public accountant agrees with the assertions contained in any notice filed by the institution under § 363.4(d), and whether the institution's notice discloses all relevant reasons for the accountant's termination. Subject to the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1) regarding compliance with the audited financial statements requirement at the holding company level, the independent public accountant for an insured depository institution that is a public company and files reports with its appropriate Federal banking agency, or is a subsidiary of a public company that files reports with the SEC, may submit the letter it furnished to management to be filed with the institution's or the holding company's current report (SEC Form 8-K) concerning a change in accountant to satisfy the notice requirements of § 363.3(c). Alternatively, if the independent public accountant confirms that management has filed a current report (SEC Form 8-K) concerning a change in accountant that satisfies the notice requirements of § 363.4(d) and includes an independent public accountant's letter that satisfies the requirements of § 363.3(c), the independent public accountant may rely on the current report (SEC Form 8-K) filed with the FDIC by management concerning a change in accountant to satisfy the notice requirements of § 363.3(c).
