#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Rate limitations.

5.Limitations on both periodic and maximum rates must be reflected in the historical example. If ranges of rate limitations are provided under § 1026.40(d)(12)(ix), the highest rates provided in those ranges must be used in the example. Rate limitations that may apply more often than annually should be treated as if they were annual limitations. For example, if a creditor imposes a 1% cap every six months, this should be reflected in the example as if it were a 2% annual cap.
