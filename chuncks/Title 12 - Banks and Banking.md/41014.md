##### Consumer satisfaction of outstanding subordinate loans.

2.If the consumer is satisfying existing liens which will not be deducted from the sales price, the amount of the outstanding balance of the loan must be disclosed under § 1026.38(k)(2)(viii). For example, the amount of any second lien which will be paid as part of the real estate closing that is not deducted from the seller's proceeds under § 1026.38(k)(2)(iv), is disclosed under § 1026.38(k)(2)(viii). For payments to the subordinate lien holder, any amounts paid must be disclosed, and other amounts paid by or on behalf of the seller must be disclosed as paid outside of closing funds under § 1026.38(j)(2)(vi). For additional discussion, see comment 38(j)(2)(vi)-2.
