###### Bond Loans to Eligible CDFIs.

(c)The Qualified Issuer will use Bond Proceeds to make Bond Loans to Eligible CDFIs for Eligible Purposes, as those terms are defined in section 1808.102. The CDFI Fund will evaluate each Eligible CDFI using standard Bond Loan Requirements to assess their creditworthiness and capacity to receive a Bond Loan. Each Eligible CDFI may borrow a Bond Loan in an amount that is at least $10,000,000. The Bond Loan Rate shall be the same as the Bond Rate on the particular advance of funds under the Bond that funds the Bond Loan. The aggregate of the principal amounts of the Bond Loans must not exceed the maximum principal amount of the corresponding Bond Issue. The Qualified Issuer must execute Bond Loan documents for 100 percent of the principal amount of each Bond on the Bond Issue Date. Bond Loan proceeds may not be drawn down from the Qualified Issuer until the Eligible CDFI has an immediate use for the Bond Loan proceeds. Five percent, or such other amount that is determined by the CDFI Fund in its sole discretion, of Bond Loan proceeds may be used by an Eligible CDFI to capitalize Loan Loss Reserves.
