######## Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk-weighted assets,In general.

(e)-(1)With respect to its OTC derivative contracts, an FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a CVA risk-weighted asset amount for its portfolio of OTC derivative transactions that are subject to the CVA capital requirement using the simple CVA approach described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section or, with prior written approval of the FDIC, the advanced CVA approach described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. An FDIC-supervised institution that receives prior FDIC approval to calculate its CVA risk-weighted asset amounts for a class of counterparties using the advanced CVA approach must continue to use that approach for that class of counterparties until it notifies the FDIC in writing that the FDIC-supervised institution expects to begin calculating its CVA risk-weighted asset amount using the simple CVA approach. Such notice must include an explanation of the FDIC-supervised institution's rationale and the date upon which the FDIC-supervised institution will begin to calculate its CVA risk-weighted asset amount using the simple CVA approach.
