###### Brief identification.

1.The statement identifying warranties may be brief and need not describe or list all warranties applicable to specific parts such as for air conditioning, radio, or tires in an automobile. For example, manufacturer's warranties may be identified simply by a reference to the standard manufacturer's warranty. If a lessor provides a comprehensive list of warranties that may not all apply, to comply with ยง 213.4(p) the lessor must indicate which warranties apply or, alternatively, which warranties do not apply.
