####### Additional tier 1 capital.

(c)Additional tier 1 capital is the sum of additional tier 1 capital elements and any related surplus, minus the regulatory adjustments and deductions in ยง 324.22. Additional tier 1 capital elements are:

(1) Instruments (plus any related surplus) that meet the following criteria:

(i) The instrument is issued and paid-in;

(ii) The instrument is subordinated to depositors, general creditors, and subordinated debt holders of the FDIC-supervised institution in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

(iii) The instrument is not secured, not covered by a guarantee of the FDIC-supervised institution or of an affiliate of the FDIC-supervised institution, and not subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the instrument;

(iv) The instrument has no maturity date and does not contain a dividend step-up or any other term or feature that creates an incentive to redeem; and

(v) If callable by its terms, the instrument may be called by the FDIC-supervised institution only after a minimum of five years following issuance, except that the terms of the instrument may allow it to be called earlier than five years upon the occurrence of a regulatory event that precludes the instrument from being included in additional tier 1 capital, a tax event, or if the issuing entity is required to register as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act. In addition:

(A) The FDIC-supervised institution must receive prior approval from the FDIC to exercise a call option on the instrument.

(B) The FDIC-supervised institution does not create at issuance of the instrument, through any action or communication, an expectation that the call option will be exercised.

(C) Prior to exercising the call option, or immediately thereafter, the FDIC-supervised institution must either: Replace the instrument to be called with an equal amount of instruments that meet the criteria under paragraph (b) of this section or this paragraph (c);or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC that following redemption, the FDIC-supervised institution will continue to hold capital commensurate with its risk.

(vi) Redemption or repurchase of the instrument requires prior approval from the FDIC.

(vii) The FDIC-supervised institution has full discretion at all times to cancel dividends or other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of other restrictions on the FDIC-supervised institution except in relation to any distributions to holders of common stock or instruments that are pari passu with the instrument.

(viii) Any cash dividend payments on the instrument are paid out of the FDIC-supervised institution's net income or retained earnings. An FDIC-supervised institution must obtain prior FDIC approval for any dividend payment involving a reduction or retirement of capital stock in accordance with 12 CFR 303.241.

(ix) The instrument does not have a credit-sensitive feature, such as a dividend rate that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the FDIC-supervised institution's credit quality, but may have a dividend rate that is adjusted periodically independent of the FDIC-supervised institution's credit quality, in relation to general market interest rates or similar adjustments.

(x) The paid-in amount is classified as equity under GAAP.

(xi) The FDIC-supervised institution, or an entity that the FDIC-supervised institution controls, did not purchase or directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument.

(xii) The instrument does not have any features that would limit or discourage additional issuance of capital by the FDIC-supervised institution, such as provisions that require the FDIC-supervised institution to compensate holders of the instrument if a new instrument is issued at a lower price during a specified time frame.

(xiii) If the instrument is not issued directly by the FDIC-supervised institution or by a subsidiary of the FDIC-supervised institution that is an operating entity, the only asset of the issuing entity is its investment in the capital of the FDIC-supervised institution, and proceeds must be immediately available without limitation to the FDIC-supervised institution or to the FDIC-supervised institution's top-tier holding company in a form which meets or exceeds all of the other criteria for additional tier 1 capital instruments.

(xiv) For an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution, the governing agreement, offering circular, or prospectus of an instrument issued after the date upon which the FDIC-supervised institution becomes subject to this part as set forth in ยง 324.1(f) must disclose that the holders of the instrument may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the FDIC-supervised institution enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.

(2) Tier 1 minority interest, subject to the limitations in ยง 324.21, that is not included in the FDIC-supervised institution's common equity tier 1 capital.

(3)(i) Any and all instruments that qualified as tier 1 capital under the FDIC's general risk-based capital rules under 12 CFR part 325, appendix A (state nonmember banks) and 12 CFR part 390, subpart Z (state savings associations) as then in effect, that were issued under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010or prior to October 4, 2010, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

(ii) Any preferred stock instruments issued under the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Emergency Capital Investment Program pursuant to section 104A of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.

(4) Notwithstanding the criteria for additional tier 1 capital instruments referenced above:

(i) An instrument issued by an FDIC-supervised institution and held in trust for the benefit of its employees as part of an employee stock ownership plan does not violate any of the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, provided that any repurchase is required solely by virtue of ERISA for an instrument of an FDIC-supervised institution that is not publicly-traded. In addition, an instrument issued by an FDIC-supervised institution to its employee stock ownership plan does not violate the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(v) or paragraph (c)(1)(xi) of this section; and

(ii) An instrument with terms that provide that the instrument may be called earlier than five years upon the occurrence of a rating agency event does not violate the criterion in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section provided that the instrument was issued and included in an FDIC-supervised institution's tier 1 capital prior to the January 1, 2014, and that such instrument satisfies all other criteria under this paragraph (c).
