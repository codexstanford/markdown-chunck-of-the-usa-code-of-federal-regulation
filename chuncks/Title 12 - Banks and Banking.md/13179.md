###### Timing of disclosures.

2.If disclosures are given early, for example under ยง 226.17(f) or ยง 226.19(a), the creditor need not redisclose if the actual premium is different at the time of consummation. If insurance disclosures are not given at the time of early disclosure and insurance is in fact written in connection with the transaction, the disclosures under ยง 226.4(d) must be made in order to exclude the premiums from the finance charge.
