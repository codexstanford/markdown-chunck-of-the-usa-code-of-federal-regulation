1.A loan for the purchase of a home that has yet to be constructed, or a loan to purchase a home under construction (construction is currently underway), is a construction loan to build a home for the purposes of § 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(F). However, if a use and occupancy permit has been issued for the home prior to the issuance of the disclosures required under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the home is not considered to be under construction and the transaction would not be a construction loan to build a home for the purposes of § 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(F).
