##### Itemization on a separate page.

3.Section 1006.34(c)(2)(viii) provides that a debt collector may disclose the itemization of the current amount of the debt on a separate page provided in the same communication with a validation notice if the debt collector includes on the validation notice, where the itemization would have appeared, a statement referring to that separate page. A debt collector may comply with the requirement to refer to the separate page by, for example, including on the validation notice the statement, "See the enclosed separate page for an itemization of the debt," situated next to the information about the current amount of the debt required by § 1006.34(c)(2)(ix).
