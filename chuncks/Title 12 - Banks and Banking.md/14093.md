1.The creditor has 2 alternatives in complying with ยง 226.18(c):

- The creditor may inform the consumer, on the segregated disclosures, that a written itemization of the amount financed will be provided on request, furnishing the itemization only if the customer in fact requests it.

- The creditor may provide an itemization as a matter of course, without notifying the consumer of the right to receive it or waiting for a request.

Whether given as a matter of course or only on request, the itemization must be provided at the same time as the other disclosures required by ยง 226.18, although separate from those disclosures.
