###### Pre-consummation waiting period.

1.A creditor must furnish § 226.32 disclosures at least three business days prior to consummation. Under § 226.32, "business day" has the same meaning as the rescission rule in comment 2(a)(6)-2-all calendar days except Sundays and the federal legal holidays listed in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). However, while the disclosure rule under §§ 226.15 and 226.23 extends to midnight of the third business day, the rule under § 226.32 does not. For example, under § 226.32, if disclosures were provided on a Friday, consummation could occur any time on Tuesday, the third business day following receipt of the disclosures. If the timing of the rescission rule were to be used, consummation could not occur until after midnight on Tuesday.
