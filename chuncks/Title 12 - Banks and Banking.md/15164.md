Because the card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Board under ยง 226.58(c)(1), the card issuer is required to post and maintain the agreement on the card issuer's publicly available Web site under ยง 226.58(d). However, because the agreement is offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, the card issuer may comply with ยง 226.58(d) in either of two ways. First, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's own publicly available Web site. Alternatively, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the publicly available Web site of Merchant Athe publicly available Web site of at least one of Merchants B, C and D. It would not be sufficient for the card issuer to post the agreement on Merchant A's Web site alone because ยง 226.58(d) requires the card issuer to post the agreement on the publicly available Web site of "at least one of the merchants at which cards issued underprivate label credit card plan may be used" (emphasis added).

In contrast, assume that a card issuer has 100,000 open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 5,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 95,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates, Merchants C and D. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for both of these types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of account.
