#### Supplement I to Part 1013-Official Interpretations
##### Basis of estimates.

2.Estimates must be made on the basis of the best information reasonably available at the time disclosures are made. The "reasonably available" standard requires that the lessor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. The lessor may rely on the representations of other parties. For example, the lessor might look to the consumer to determine the purpose for which leased property will be used, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to an automobile manufacturer or dealer for the date of delivery. See commentary to § 1013.4(n) for estimating official fees and taxes.
