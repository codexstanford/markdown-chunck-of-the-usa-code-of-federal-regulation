#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Same identification number as Loan Estimate.

1.The loan identification number disclosed pursuant to § 1026.38(a)(5)(v) must be one that enables the creditor, consumer, and other parties to identify the transaction as the same transaction disclosed on the Loan Estimate. The loan identification number may contain any alpha-numeric characters. If a creditor uses the same loan identification number on several revised Loan Estimates to the consumer, but adds after such number a hyphen and a number to denote the number of revised Loan Estimates in sequence, the creditor must disclose the loan identification number before such hyphen on the Closing Disclosure to identify the transaction as the same for which the initial and revised Loan Estimates were provided.
