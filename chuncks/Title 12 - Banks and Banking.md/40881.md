##### Translation.

6.Section 1026.37(o)(5)(ii) permits the translation of form H-24 into languages other than English, consistent with § 1026.27. Pursuant to § 1026.37(o)(5)(ii) creditors may modify form H-24 to the extent that translation prevents the headings, labels, designations, and required disclosure items under § 1026.37 from fitting in the space provided on form H-24. For example, if the translation of a required label does not fit within the line provided for such label in form H-24, the label may be disclosed over two lines. See form H-28 of appendix H to this part for Spanish translations of form H-24.
