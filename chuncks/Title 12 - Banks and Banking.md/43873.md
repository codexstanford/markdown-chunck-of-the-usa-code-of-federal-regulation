##### § 1102.309 Confidential treatment procedures.
###### Form of request.

(b)A request for confidential treatment shall be submitted in a separate letter or memorandum conspicuously entitled, "Request for Confidential Treatment." Each request shall state in reasonable detail the facts and arguments supporting the request and its legal justification. If the submitter had been required by the ASC to provide the particular information, conclusory statements that the information would be useful to competitors or would impair sales or similar statements generally will not be considered sufficient to justify confidential treatment. When the submitter had voluntarily provided the particular information to the ASC, the submitter must specifically identify the documents or information which are of a kind the submitter would not customarily make available to the public.
