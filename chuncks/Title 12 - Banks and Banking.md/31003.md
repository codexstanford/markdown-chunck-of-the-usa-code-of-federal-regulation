###### i.e.,

(8) The builder must incur a significant percentage of direct costs (the actual costs of land, labor, and material) before any drawdown on the loan;

(9) If at any time during the life of the construction loan any of the criteria of this rule are no longer satisfied, the corporate must immediately recategorize the loan at a 100 percent risk-weight and must accurately report the loan in the corporate's next quarterly call report;

(10) The home purchaser must intend that the home will be owner-occupied;

(11) The home purchaser(s) must be an individual(s), not a partnership, joint venture, trust corporation, or any other entity (including an entity acting as a sole proprietorship) that is purchasing the home(s) for speculative purposes; and

(12) The loan must be performing and not more than 90 days past due.

The NCUA retains the discretion to determine that any loans not meeting sound lending principles must be placed in a higher risk-weight category. The NCUA also reserves the discretion to modify these criteria on a case-by-case basis provided that any such modifications are not inconsistent with the safety and soundness objectives of this definition.
