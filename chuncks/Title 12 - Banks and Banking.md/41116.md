##### Format of disclosure.

1.Section 1026.39(d)(5) requires disclosure of the partial payment policy of covered persons for closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling or real property, other than a reverse mortgage transaction subject to § 1026.33. A covered person may utilize the format of the disclosure illustrated by form H-25 of appendix H to this part for the information required to be disclosed by § 1026.38(l)(5). For example, the statement required § 1026.39(d)(5)(iii) that a new covered person may have a different partial payment policy may be disclosed using the language illustrated by form H-25, which states "If this loan is sold, your new lender may have a different policy." The text illustrated by form H-25 may be modified to suit the format of the covered person's disclosure under § 1026.39. For example, the format illustrated by form H-25 begins with the text, "Your lender may" or "Your lender does not," which may not be suitable to the format of the covered person's other disclosures under § 1026.39. This text may be modified to suit the format of the covered person's integrated disclosure, using a phrase such as "We will" or "We are your new lender and have a different Partial Payment Policy than your previous lender. Under our policy we will." Any modifications must be appropriate and not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.
