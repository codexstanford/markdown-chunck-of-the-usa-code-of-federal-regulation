####### Potential impact on capital.

(c)In conducting stress tests under this subpart, the credit union, or the NCUA if it elects to conduct the stress test under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will estimate the following for each scenario during each quarter of the planning horizon:

(1) Losses, pre-provision net revenues, loan and lease loss provisions, and net income; and

(2) The potential impact on the stress test capital ratio, incorporating the effects of any capital action over the planning horizon and maintenance of an allowance for loan losses appropriate for credit exposures throughout the horizon. The credit union, or the NCUA if it elects to conduct the stress test under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will conduct the stress tests without assuming any risk mitigation actions on the part of the credit union, except those existing and identified as part of the credit union's balance sheet, or off-balance sheet positions, such as derivative positions, on the date of the stress test.
