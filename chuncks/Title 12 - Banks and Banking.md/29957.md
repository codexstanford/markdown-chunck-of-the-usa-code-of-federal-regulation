When, as the result of an initial Concentration of Facilities ratio calculation, a proposed area does not qualify as "underserved by other depository institutions," NCUA will exclude non- depository banks (trust companies) and non-community credit unions (those institutions unable to serve the general public) from the computation. For the purposes of this analysis, a multiple common bond credit union already serving the area as an underserved area is considered able to serve the general public and thus would not be excluded. With both of these exclusions, NCUA will recalculate the concentration of facilities ratio to determine whether, as a result, the proposed area qualifies as "underserved by other depository institutions."
