#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Disclosure required.

1.The creditor must give a definitive statement of whether or not a prepayment penalty will be imposed or a prepayment rebate will be given.

i. The fact that no prepayment penalty will be imposed may not simply be inferred from the absence of a prepayment penalty disclosure; the creditor must indicate that prepayment will not result in a prepayment penalty.

ii. If a prepayment penalty or prepayment rebate is possible for one type of prepayment, even though not for all, a positive disclosure is required. This applies to any type of prepayment, whether voluntary or involuntary as in the case of prepayments resulting from acceleration.

iii. Any difference in prepayment rebate or prepayment penalty policy, depending on whether prepayment is voluntary or not, must not be disclosed with the segregated disclosures.
