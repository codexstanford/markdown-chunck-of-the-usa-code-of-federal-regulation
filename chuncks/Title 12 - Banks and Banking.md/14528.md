2.Section 226.32(b)(1)(iii) defines "points and fees" to include all items listed in ยง 226.4(c)(7), other than amounts held for the future payment of taxes. An item listed in ยง 226.4(c)(7) may be excluded from the "points and fees" calculation, however, if the charge is reasonable, the creditor receives no direct or indirect compensation from the charge, and the charge is not paid to an affiliate of the creditor. For example, a reasonable fee paid by the consumer to an independent, third-party appraiser may be excluded from the "points and fees" calculation (assuming no compensation is paid to the creditor). A fee paid by the consumer for an appraisal performed by the creditor must be included in the calculation, even though the fee may be excluded from the finance charge if it is bona fide and reasonable in amount.
