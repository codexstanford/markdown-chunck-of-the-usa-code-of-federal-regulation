###### Collateral.

(5)If it requires collateral to manage its or its participants' credit exposure, the designated financial market utility accepts collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks and sets and enforces conservative haircuts and concentration limits, in order to ensure the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation and that the collateral can be used in a timely manner. In this regard, the designated financial market utility-

(i) Establishes prudent valuation practices and develops haircuts that are tested regularly and take into account stressed market conditions;

(ii) Establishes haircuts that are calibrated to include relevant periods of stressed market conditions to reduce the need for procyclical adjustments;

(iii) Provides for annual validation of its haircut procedures, as part of its risk-management model validation under paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section;

(iv) Avoids concentrated holdings of any particular type of asset where the concentration could significantly impair the ability to liquidate such assets quickly without significant adverse price effects;

(v) Uses a collateral management system that is well-designed and operationally flexible such that it, among other things,-

(A) Accommodates changes in the ongoing monitoring and management of collateral; and

(B) Allows for the timely valuation of collateral and execution of any collateral or margin calls.
