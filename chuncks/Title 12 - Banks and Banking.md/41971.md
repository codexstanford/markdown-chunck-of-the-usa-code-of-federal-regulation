## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Private label credit card exception.

1.i. Under § 1026.58(c)(6)(i), a card issuer is not required to submit to the Bureau a credit card agreement if, as of the last business day of the calendar quarter, the agreement (A) is offered for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans each of which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts; and (B) is not offered to the public other than for accounts under such a plan. For example, a card issuer offers to the public a credit card agreement offered solely for private label credit card accounts with credit cards that can be used only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 8,000 open accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer is not required to submit this agreement to the Bureau under § 1026.58(c)(1) because the agreement is offered for a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts, and the credit card agreement is not offered to the public other than for accounts under that private label credit card plan.
