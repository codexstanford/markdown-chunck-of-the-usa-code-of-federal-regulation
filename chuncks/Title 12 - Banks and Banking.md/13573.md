###### Balances subject to periodic rates.

ii.Under ยง 226.7(b)(5), creditors must disclose the balances subject to interest during a billing cycle. The deferred interest balance ($500 in this example) is not subject to interest for billing cycles between the date of purchase and July 31 in this example. Periodic statements sent for those billing cycles should not include the deferred interest balance in the balance disclosed under ยง 226.7(b)(5). This amount must be separately disclosed on periodic statements and identified by a term other than the term used to identify the balance disclosed under ยง 226.7(b)(5) (such as "deferred interest balance"). During any billing cycle in which an interest charge on the deferred interest balance is debited to the account, the balance disclosed under ยง 226.7(b)(5) should include the deferred interest balance for that billing cycle.
