###### Insurance written in connection with a transaction.

2.Credit insurance sold before or after an open-end (not home-secured) plan is opened is considered "written in connection with a credit transaction." Insurance sold after consummation in closed-end credit transactions or after the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of ยง 226.5b is not considered "written in connection with" the credit transaction if the insurance is written because of the consumer's default (for example, by failing to obtain or maintain required property insurance) or because the consumer requests insurance after consummation or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of ยง 226.5b (although credit-sale disclosures may be required for the insurance sold after consummation if it is financed).
