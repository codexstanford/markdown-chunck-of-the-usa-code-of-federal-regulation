(b)In the event the hearing officer presiding over the proceeding determines that it will not be possible to issue preliminary findings and conclusions within the time periods specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the hearing officer will submit a written request to the Director for an extension of the time period for filing the preliminary findings and conclusions. This request must be filed no later than 28 days prior to the expiration of the time for issuance of preliminary findings and conclusions. The request will be served on all parties in the proceeding, who may file with the Director briefs in support of or in opposition to the request. Any such briefs must be filed within seven days of service of the hearing officer's request and may not exceed five pages. If the Director determines that additional time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Director will issue an order extending the time period for filing preliminary findings and conclusions.
