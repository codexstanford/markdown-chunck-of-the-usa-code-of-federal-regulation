## Chapter I - Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury
### PART 9 - FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL BANKS
#### Interpretations
##### ยง 9.101 Providing investment advice for a fee.
###### In general.

(a)The term "fiduciary capacity" at ยง 9.2(e) is defined to include "investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice." In other words, if a bank is providing investment advice for a fee, then it is acting in a fiduciary capacity. For purposes of that definition, "investment adviser" generally means a national bank that provides advice or recommendations concerning the purchase or sale of specific securities, such as a national bank engaged in portfolio advisory and management activities (including acting as investment adviser to a mutual fund). Additionally, the qualifying phrase "if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice" excludes those activities in which the investment advice is merely incidental to other services.
