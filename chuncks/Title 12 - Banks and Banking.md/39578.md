#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Daily rate with specific transaction charge.

2.Section 1026.14(c)(3) sets forth an acceptable method for calculating the annual percentage rate if the finance charge results from a charge relating to a specific transaction and the application of a daily periodic rate. This section includes the requirement that the creditor follow the rules in appendix F to part 1026 in calculating the annual percentage rate, especially the provision in the introductory section of appendix F which addresses the daily rate/transaction charge situation by providing that the "average of daily balances" shall be used instead of the "sum of the balances."
