###### i. Special meeting requirements:

To remove a director under section 3 of this Article requires a majority vote of members present at a special meeting called for the purpose of voting on removal. The bylaw requires that the affected director have the "opportunity to be heard." NCUA interprets this provision as requiring the vote to occur at an in-person meeting rather than by mail ballot. At an in-person meeting, the director subject to the removal vote can make his or her case before the members. The director removal provisions derive from provisions of the Act, as follows:

- The bylaws govern the conduct of special meetings;

- Members must have the opportunity to vote, at a meeting, on the Supervisory Committee's suspension of a director;and

- FCU members may be expelled by vote of members present at a meeting called for that purpose.
