###### Quotient method.

1.Section 226.14(d) addresses use of a daily periodic rate(s) to determine some or all of the finance charge and use of the quotient method to determine the annual percentage rate. Since the quotient formula in ยง 226.14(c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) cannot be used when a daily rate is being applied to a series of daily balances, ยง 226.14(d) provides two alternative ways to calculate the annual percentage rate-either of which satisfies the provisions of ยง 226.7(a)(7).
