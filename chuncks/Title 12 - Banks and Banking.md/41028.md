1.Section 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)() requires disclosure of the amount the consumer will be required to pay into the escrow account with each periodic payment during the first year after consummation. Section 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)() requires a disclosure, labeled "Escrowed Property Costs over Year 1," calculated as the amount disclosed under § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)() multiplied by the number of periodic payments scheduled to be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation. For example, creditors may base such disclosures on less than 12 payments if, based on the payment schedule dictated by the legal obligation, fewer than 12 periodic payments will be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation. Alternatively, § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)() permits the creditor to base the disclosures required by § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)() and () on amounts derived from the escrow account analysis required under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, even if those disclosures differ from what would otherwise be disclosed under § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)() and ()-as, for example, when there are fewer than 12 periodic payments scheduled to be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation.
