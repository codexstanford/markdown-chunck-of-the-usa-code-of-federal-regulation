##### Minimum interest rate.

1.The minimum interest rate required to be disclosed by § 1026.37(j)(4) is the minimum interest rate that may occur at any time during the term of the transaction, after any introductory or "teaser" interest rate expires, under the terms of the legal obligation, such as an interest rate "floor." If the terms of the legal obligation do not state a minimum interest rate, the minimum interest rate that applies to the transaction under applicable law must be disclosed. If the terms of the legal obligation do not state a minimum interest rate, and no other minimum interest rate applies to the transaction under applicable law, the amount of the margin is disclosed.
