###### New accounts.

1.New account disclosures must be provided when:

i. A term share account that does not automatically rollover is renewed by a member.

ii. A member changes the term for a renewable term share account (from a one-year term share account to a six-month term share account, for instance) (see comment 5(b)-5 regarding disclosure alternatives).

iii. A credit union transfers funds from an account to open a new account not at the member's request, unless the credit union previously gave account disclosures and any change-in-terms notices for the new account (e.g., funds in a money market share account are transferred by a credit union to open a new account for the member, such as a share draft account, because the member exceeded transaction limitations on the money market share account).

iv. A credit union accepts a deposit from a member to an account that the credit union had previously deemed to be "closed," under applicable federal or state law, for the purpose of treating accrued, but uncredited, dividends as forfeited dividends. New account numbers are not required by this requirement.
