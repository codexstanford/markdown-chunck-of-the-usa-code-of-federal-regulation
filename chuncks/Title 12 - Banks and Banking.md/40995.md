### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Subordinate financing proceeds on first-lien Closing Disclosure.

2.Any financing arrangements or other new loans not otherwise disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iii) or (iv) must be disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(vi) on the first-lien Closing Disclosure. For example, if the consumer is using a second mortgage loan to finance part of the purchase price, whether from the same creditor, another creditor, or the seller, the principal amount of the second loan must be disclosed with a brief explanation on the first-lien Closing Disclosure. In this example, the principal amount of the subordinate financing is disclosed on the summaries of transactions table for the borrower's transaction either on line 04 under the subheading "L. Paid Already by or on Behalf of Borrower at Closing," or under the subheading "Other Credits." If the net proceeds of the subordinate financing are less than the principal amount of the subordinate financing, the net proceeds must also be listed, and may be listed on the same line as the principal amount of the subordinate financing on the first-lien Closing Disclosure. For an example, see form H-25(C) of appendix H to this part.
