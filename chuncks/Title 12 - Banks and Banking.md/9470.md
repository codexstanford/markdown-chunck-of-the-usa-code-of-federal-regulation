() For repo-style transactions, when applying § 217.37(c)(2), the Board-regulated institution must use the methodology in § 217.37(c)(3);

(B) VM= any collateral posted by clearing member i to the QCCP that it is entitled to receive from the QCCP, but has not yet received, and any collateral that the QCCP has actually received from clearing member i;

(C) IM= the collateral posted as initial margin by clearing member i to the QCCP;

(D) DF= the funded portion of clearing member i's default fund contribution that will be applied to reduce the QCCP's loss upon a default by clearing member i;

(E) RW = 20 percent, except when the Board has determined that a higher risk weight is more appropriate based on the specific characteristics of the QCCP and its clearing members; and

(F) Where a QCCP has provided its K, a Board-regulated institution must rely on such disclosed figure instead of calculating Kunder this paragraph (d), unless the Board-regulated institution determines that a more conservative figure is appropriate based on the nature, structure, or characteristics of the QCCP.

(ii) For a Board-regulated institution that is a clearing member of a QCCP with a default fund supported by funded commitments, Kequals:

Subscripts 1 and 2 denote the clearing members with the two largest Avalues. For purposes of this paragraph (d), for derivatives Ais defined in § 217.34(a)(2)(ii) and for repo-style transactions, Ameans the exposure amount as defined in § 217.37(c)(2) using the methodology in § 217.37(c)(3);

(B) N = the number of clearing members in the QCCP;

(C) DF= the QCCP's own funds and other financial resources that would be used to cover its losses before clearing members' default fund contributions are used to cover losses;

(D) DF= funded default fund contributions from all clearing members and any other clearing member contributed financial resources that are available to absorb mutualized QCCP losses;

(E) DF = DF+ DF(that is, the total funded default fund contribution);
