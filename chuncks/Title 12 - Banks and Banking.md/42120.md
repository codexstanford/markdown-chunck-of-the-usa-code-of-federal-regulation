#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Prepaid card that can access multiple separate credit features.

6.i. Even if a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature, it is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to any non-covered separate credit features.

ii. For example, assume that a prepaid card can access "Separate Credit Feature A" where the card can be used from time to time to access credit from a separate credit feature that is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. In addition, assume that the prepaid card can also access "Separate Credit Feature B" but that credit feature is being offered by an unrelated third-party creditor that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to Separate Credit Feature A because it is a covered separate credit feature. The prepaid card, however, is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to Separate Credit Feature B because it is a non-covered separate credit feature.
