###### Model C-4 Holds to statutory limits on all deposits.

5.A bank may use this model when its policy is to impose delays to the full extent allowed under ยง 229.12 and to reserve the right to invoke the ยง 229.13 exceptions. In disclosing that a longer delay may apply, a bank may disclose when funds will generally be available based on when the funds would be available if the deposit were of a nonlocal check. Model C-4 uses a chart to show the bank's availability policy for local and nonlocal checks and Model C-5 uses a narrative description.
