###### Interpretations
####### ยง 211.604 Data processing activities.
######## Introduction.

(a)As a result of a recent proposal by a bank holding company to engage in data processing activities abroad, the Board has considered the scope of permissible data processing activities under Regulation K (12 CFR part 211). This question has arisen as a result of the fact that ยง 211.5(d)(10) of Regulation K does not specifically indicate the scope of data processing as a permissible activity abroad.
