###### Definition.

1.This paragraph requires a disclosure only if charges are added to individual delinquent installments by a creditor who otherwise considers the transaction ongoing on its original terms. Late payment charges do not include:

- The right of acceleration.

- Fees imposed for actual collection costs, such as repossession charges or attorney's fees.

- Deferral and extension charges.

- The continued accrual of simple interest at the contract rate after the payment due date. However, an increase in the interest rate is a late payment charge to the extent of the increase.
