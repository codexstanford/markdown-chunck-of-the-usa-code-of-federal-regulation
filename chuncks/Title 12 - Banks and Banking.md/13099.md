###### Business-purpose credit cards-extensions of credit for consumer purposes.

i.If a business-purpose credit card is issued to a person, the provisions of the regulation do not apply, other than as provided in §§ 226.12(a) and 226.12(b), even if extensions of credit for consumer purposes are occasionally made using that business-purpose credit card. For example, the billing error provisions set forth in § 226.13 do not apply to consumer-purpose extensions of credit using a business-purpose credit card.
