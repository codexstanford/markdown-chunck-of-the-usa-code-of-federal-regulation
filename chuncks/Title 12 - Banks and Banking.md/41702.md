##### Mandatory fees.

3.For purposes of estimating required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in § 1026.51(a)(2)(ii), mandatory fees that must be assumed to be charged include those fees the card issuer knows the consumer will be required to pay under the terms of the account if the account is opened, such as an annual fee. If a mandatory fee is a promotional fee (as defined in § 1026.16(g)), the issuer must use the post-promotional fee amount for purposes of § 1026.51(a)(2)(ii).
