ii. The Bureau has determined that effective April 1, 2022, the spread-adjusted indices based on SOFR recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for consumer products to replace the 1-month, 3-month, or 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR indices have historical fluctuations that are substantially similar to those of the 1-month, 3-month, or 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR indices respectively. In order to use this SOFR-based spread-adjusted index for consumer products as the replacement index for the applicable LIBOR index, the creditor also must comply with the condition in § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(B) that the SOFR-based spread-adjusted index for consumer products and replacement margin will produce an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR index and the margin that applied to the variable rate immediately prior to the replacement of the LIBOR index used under the plan. Because of the exception in § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(B), the creditor must use the index value on June 30, 2023, for the LIBOR index and, for the SOFR-based spread-adjusted index for consumer products, must use the index value on the first date that index is published, in determining whether the annual percentage rate based on the replacement index is substantially similar to the rate based on the LIBOR index.comments 40(f)(3)(ii)(B)-2 and -3.
