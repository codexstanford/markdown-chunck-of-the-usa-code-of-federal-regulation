#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Accrued finance charges allocated from payments.

3.Some plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and therefore reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the new balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.
