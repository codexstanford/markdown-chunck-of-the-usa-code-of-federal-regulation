####### Broker-dealer segregated account inflow amount.

(g)A FDIC-supervised institution's broker-dealer segregated account inflow amount is the fair value of all assets released from broker-dealer segregated accounts maintained in accordance with statutory or regulatory requirements for the protection of customer trading assets, provided that the calculation of the broker-dealer segregated account inflow amount, for any transaction affecting the calculation of the segregated balance (as required by applicable law), shall be consistent with the following:

(1) In calculating the broker-dealer segregated account inflow amount, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the fair value of the required balance of the customer reserve account as of 30 calendar days from the calculation date by assuming that customer cash and collateral positions have changed consistent with the outflow and inflow calculations required under §§ 329.32 and 329.33.

(2) If the fair value of the required balance of the customer reserve account as of 30 calendar days from the calculation date, as calculated consistent with the outflow and inflow calculations required under §§ 329.32 and 329.33, is less than the fair value of the required balance as of the calculation date, the difference is the segregated account inflow amount.

(3) If the fair value of the required balance of the customer reserve account as of 30 calendar days from the calculation date, as calculated consistent with the outflow and inflow calculations required under §§ 329.32 and 329.33, is more than the fair value of the required balance as of the calculation date, the segregated account inflow amount is zero.
