###### Persons who advertise accounts.

2.Persons who advertise accounts are subject to the advertising rules. This includes agent and agented accounts, such as a member who subdivides interests in a jumbo term share certificate account for sale to other parties or among members who form a certificate account investment club. For example, if an agent places an advertisement that offers members an interest in an account at a credit union, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement, whether the account is held by the agent or directly by the member.
