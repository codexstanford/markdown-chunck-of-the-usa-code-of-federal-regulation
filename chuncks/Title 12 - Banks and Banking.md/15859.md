Regulation CC preempts state disclosure requirements concerning funds availability that relate tothat are inconsistent with the federal requirements. The state requriements are different from, and therefore inconsistent with, the federal disclosure rules. (ยง 229.20(c)(2)). Thus, the Connecticut statute is preempted by Regulation CC to the extent that these disclosure provisions apply toas defined by Regulation CC. The Connecticut disclosure rules would continue to apply to accounts, such as savings and time accounts, not governed by the Regulation CC disclosure requirements.

The Board has been requested, in accordance with ยง 229.20(d) of Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229), to determine whether the Expedited Funds Availability Act and subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A, of Regulation CC, preempt provisions of Illinois law relating to the availability of funds. Section 4-213(5) of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in Illinois (Illinois Revised Statutes Chapter 26, paragraph 4-213(5), enacted July 26, 1988) provides that:

Time periods after which deposits must be available for withdrawal shall be determined by the provisions of the federal Expedited Funds Availability Act (Title VI of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987) and the regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board for the implementation of that Act.

Section 4-213(5) of the Illinois law does not supersede Regulation CC; and, because this provision of Illinois law does not permit funds to be made available for withdrawal in a longer period of time than required under the Act and Regulation, it is not preempted by Regulation CC.

The Board has been requested, in accordance with ยง 229.20(d) of Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229), to determine whether the Expedited Funds Availability Act (the "Act") and subpart B (and in connection therewith, subpart A) of Regulation CC, preempt the provisions of Maine law concerning the availability of funds. This preemption determination addresses the relation of the Act and Regulation CC to the Maine funds availability law. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4-213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.)

In 1985, Maine adopted a statute governing funds availability (Title 9-B MRSA section 241(5)), which requires Maine financial institutions to make funds deposited in a transaction account, savings account, or time account available for withdrawal within a reasonable period. The Maine statute gives the Superintendent of Banking for the State of Maine the authority to promulgate rules setting forth time limitations and disclosure requirements governing funds availability.

The Superintendent of Banking issued regulations implementing the Maine funds availability statute, effective July 1, 1987 (Regulation 18(IV)), and adopted amendments to this regulation, effective September 1, 1988. Under the revised regulation, funds deposited to any deposit account in a Maine financial institution must be made available for withdrawal in accordance with the Act and Regulation CC (Regulation 18-IV(A)(1)). The state regulation provides that an institution's funds availability policies for accounts subject to Regulation CC be disclosed in a manner consistent with the Regulation CC requirements. Funds availability policies for accounts not subject to Regulation CC must be disclosed in accordance with the state regulation (Regulation 18-IV(A)(2)).
