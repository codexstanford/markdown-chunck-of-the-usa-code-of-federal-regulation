###### Generally accepted auditing standards

(GAAS) means the standards approved and adopted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants which apply when an independent, licensed certified public accountant audits private company financial statements in the United States of America. Auditing standards differ from auditing procedures in that procedures address acts to be performed, whereas standards measure the quality of the performance of those acts and the objectives to be achieved by use of the procedures undertaken. In addition, auditing standards address the auditor's professional qualifications as well as the judgment exercised in performing the audit and in preparing the report of the audit.
