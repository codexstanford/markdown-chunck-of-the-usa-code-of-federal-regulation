##### ยง 253.4 Board-selected benchmark replacements.
###### see

(A) The benchmark replacement shall be the "Fallback Rate (SOFR)" in the ISDA protocol (appendix A to this part) for each day on which LIBOR would ordinarily be observed occurring on or after the LIBOR replacement date. For clarity, the reference to "spread relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR" in the definition of "Fallback Rate (SOFR)" in the ISDA protocol is equal to the applicable tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(B) The benchmark replacement used to calculate the payment due for the relevant calculation period shall be determined on the derivative transaction fallback observation day in respect of the day that, under the LIBOR contract, would have been used to determine the LIBOR-based rate that is being replaced or, if the Board-selected benchmark replacement in respect of that day is not available on the derivative transaction fallback observation day, the most recently available publication on the derivative transaction fallback observation day shall be used.

(4) For a LIBOR contract that is a FFELP ABS-

(i) In place of one-month LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be 30-day Average SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

(ii) In place of three-month LIBOR, the benchmark shall be 90-day Average SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

(iii) In place of six- or 12-month tenors of LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be 30-day Average SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(4) or (5) of this section, as applicable.
