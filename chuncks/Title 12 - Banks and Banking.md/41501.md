##### Fully indexed rate.

2.The term "fully indexed rate" in § 1026.43(d)(5)(i)(A) for calculating the payment for a non-standard mortgage is generally defined in § 1026.43(b)(3) and associated commentary. Under § 1026.43(b)(3) the fully indexed rate is calculated at the time of consummation. For purposes of § 1026.43(d)(5)(i), however, the fully indexed rate is calculated within a reasonable period of time before or after the date the creditor receives the consumer's written application for the standard mortgage. Thirty days is generally considered "a reasonable period of time."
