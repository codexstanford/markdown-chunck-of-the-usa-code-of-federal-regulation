###### Mortgage broker fees.

1.In determining "points and fees" for purposes of this section, compensation paid by a consumer to a mortgage broker (directly or through the creditor for delivery to the broker) is included in the calculation whether or not the amount is disclosed as a finance charge. Mortgage broker fees that are not paid by the consumer are not included. Mortgage broker fees already included in the calculation as finance charges under ยง 226.32(b)(1)(i) need not be counted again under ยง 226.32(b)(1)(ii).
