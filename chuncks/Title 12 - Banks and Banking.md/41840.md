#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Deferred interest and similar promotional programs.,Application of § 1026.55.

3.i.The general prohibition in § 1026.55(a) applies to the imposition of accrued interest upon the expiration of a deferred interest or similar promotional program under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time. However, the exception in § 1026.55(b)(1) also applies to these programs, provided that the specified period is six months or longer and that, prior to the commencement of the period, the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the rate at which interest will accrue on the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar program if that balance is not paid in full prior to expiration of the period. See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-9. For purposes of § 1026.55, "deferred interest" has the same meaning as in § 1026.16(h)(2) and associated commentary.
