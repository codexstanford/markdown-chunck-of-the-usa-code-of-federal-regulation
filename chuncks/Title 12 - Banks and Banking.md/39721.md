### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Multiple creditors.

1.If a credit transaction involves more than one creditor:

i. The creditors must choose which of them will make the disclosures.

ii. A single, complete set of disclosures must be provided, rather than partial disclosures from several creditors.

iii. All disclosures for the transaction must be given, even if the disclosing creditor would not otherwise have been obligated to make a particular disclosure. For example, if one of the creditors is the seller, the total sale price disclosure under § 1026.18(j) must be made, even though the disclosing creditor is not the seller.
