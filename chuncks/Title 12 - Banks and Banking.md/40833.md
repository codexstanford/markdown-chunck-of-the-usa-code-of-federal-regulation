##### When table is not permitted to be disclosed.

1.The disclosure described in § 1026.37(j) is required only if the interest rate may increase after consummation, either based on changes to an index or scheduled changes to the interest rate. If the legal obligation does not permit the interest rate to adjust after consummation, such as for a "Fixed Rate" product under § 1026.37(a)(10), this table is not permitted to appear on the Loan Estimate. The creditor may not disclose a blank table or a table with "N/A" inserted within each row.
