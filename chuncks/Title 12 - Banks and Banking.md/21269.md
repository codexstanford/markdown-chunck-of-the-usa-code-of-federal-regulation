(e)The Executive Secretary, upon request from the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection and with the concurrence of the General Counsel, or their respective designees, shall issue an order terminating the insured status of the transferring insured depository institution as of the date of receipt by the FDIC of satisfactory evidence of such assumption, pursuant to section 8(q) of the FDI Act and this regulation. Generally, no order shall be issued, under this paragraph, and insured status shall be cancelled by operation of law:

(2) If the transferring institution is an insured depository institution in default and for which the FDIC has been appointed receiver.
