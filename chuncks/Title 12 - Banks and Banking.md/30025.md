###### ยง 702.103 Applicability of risk-based capital measures.

For purposes of ยง 702.102, a credit union is defined as "complex" and a risk-based capital measure is applicable only if the credit union's quarter-end total assets exceed five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000), as reflected in its most recent Call Report. A complex credit union may calculate its risk-based capital measure either by using the risk-based capital ratio under ยง 702.104(a) through (c), or, for a qualifying complex credit union opting into the CCULR framework, by using the CCULR framework under ยง 702.104(d).
