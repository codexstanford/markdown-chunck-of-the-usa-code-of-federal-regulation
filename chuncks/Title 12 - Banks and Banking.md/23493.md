####### Definition of Loan Mix Index.

(a)The Loan Mix Index assigns loans in an institution's loan portfolio to the categories of loans described in the following table. Exclude from the balance of commercial and industrial loans the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program. In the event that the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program exceeds the balance of commercial and industrial loans, exclude the remaining balance from the balance of agricultural loans, up to the total amount of agricultural loans. The Loan Mix Index is calculated by multiplying the ratio of an institution's amount of loans in a particular loan category to its total assets, excluding the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program by the associated weighted average charge-off rate for that loan category, and summing the products for all loan categories. The table gives the weighted average charge-off rate for each category of loan. The Loan Mix Index excludes credit card loans.
