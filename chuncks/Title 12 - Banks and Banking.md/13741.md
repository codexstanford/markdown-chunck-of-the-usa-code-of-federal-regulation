###### Circumstances in which § 226.9(h) does not apply.

1.Section 226.9(h) applies when § 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) requires disclosure of the consumer's right to reject a significant change to an account term. Thus, for example, § 226.9(h) does not apply to changes to the terms of home equity plans subject to the requirements of § 226.5b that are accessible by a credit or charge card because § 226.9(c)(2) does not apply to such plans. Similarly, § 226.9(h) does not apply in the following circumstances because § 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require disclosure of the right to reject in those circumstances: (i) An increase in the required minimum periodic payment; (ii) a change in an annual percentage rate applicable to a consumer's account (such as changing the margin or index for calculating a variable rate, changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate, or changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate); (iii) a change in the balance computation method necessary to comply with § 226.54; and (iv) when the change results from the creditor not receiving the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.
