iv. The relevant factors to be considered in determining whether a replacement index is comparable to a particular LIBOR index depend on the replacement index being considered and the LIBOR index being replaced. For example, these determinations may need to consider certain aspects of the historical data itself for a particular replacement index, such as whether the replacement index is a backward-looking rate (historical average of rates) such that timing aspects of the data may need to be adjusted to match up with the particular forward-looking LIBOR term-rate being replaced. The types of relevant factors to establish if a replacement index could meet the "comparable" standard with respect to a particular LIBOR index using historical data or future expectations, include but are not limited to, whether: {1} the movements over time are comparable; {2} the consumers' payments using the replacement index compared to payments using the LIBOR index are comparable if there is sufficient data for this analysis; {3} the index levels are comparable; {4} the replacement index is publicly available; and {5} the replacement index is outside the control of the creditor.
