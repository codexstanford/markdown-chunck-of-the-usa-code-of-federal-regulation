###### Date on which transaction occurred.

4.When a transaction occurred for purposes of ยง 226.55 is generally determined by the date of the transaction. However, if a transaction that occurred within 14 days after provision of a ยง 226.9(c) or (g) notice is not charged to the account prior to the effective date of the change or increase, the card issuer may treat the transaction as occurring more than 14 days after provision of the notice for purposes of ยง 226.55. See example in comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.B. In addition, when a merchant places a "hold" on the available credit on an account for an estimated transaction amount because the actual transaction amount will not be known until a later date, the date of the transaction for purposes of ยง 226.55 is the date on which the card issuer receives the actual transaction amount from the merchant. See example in comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.A.
