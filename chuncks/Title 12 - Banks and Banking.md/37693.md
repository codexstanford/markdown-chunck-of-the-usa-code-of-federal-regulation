##### § 1026.22 Determination of annual percentage rate.
###### Certain transactions involving ranges of balances.

(d)For purposes of disclosing the annual percentage rate referred to in § 1026.17(g)(4) (Mail or telephone orders-delay in disclosures) and (h) (Series of sales-delay in disclosures), if the same finance charge is imposed on all balances within a specified range of balances, the annual percentage rate computed for the median balance may be disclosed for all the balances. However, if the annual percentage rate computed for the median balance understates the annual percentage rate computed for the lowest balance by more than 8 percent of the latter rate, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on whatever lower balance will produce an annual percentage rate that does not result in an understatement of more than 8 percent of the rate determined on the lowest balance.
