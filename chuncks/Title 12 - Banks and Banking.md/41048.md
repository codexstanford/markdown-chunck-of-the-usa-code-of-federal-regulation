### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Each person to be identified.,i.e.,,e.g.,

1.Form H-25 of appendix H to this part includes the contact information required to be disclosed under § 1026.38(r) generally in a five-column tabular format (there are columns from left to right that disclose the contact information for the creditor, mortgage broker, consumer's real estate broker, seller's real estate broker, and settlement agent). Columns are left blank where no such person is participating in the transaction. For example, if there is no mortgage broker involved in the transaction, the column for the mortgage broker is left blank. Conversely, in the event the transaction involves more than one of each such person (two sellers' real estate brokers splitting a commission), the space in the contact information table provided on form H-25 of appendix H to this part may be altered to accommodate the information for such persons, provided that the information required by § 1026.38(o),(p),(q),(r) and (s) is disclosed on the same page as illustrated by form H-25. If the space provided on form H-25 does not accommodate the addition of such information, an additional table to accommodate the information may be provided on a separate page, with an appropriate reference to the additional table. A creditor or settlement agent may also omit a column on the table that is inapplicable or, if necessary, replace an inapplicable column with the contact information for the additional person.
