###### Independent appraisers.

1.The requirements that a creditor obtain two separate appraisals under ยง 34.203(d)(1), and that each appraisal be conducted by a different licensed or certified appraiser under ยง 34.203(d)(2), indicate that the two appraisals must be conducted independently of each other. If the two certified or licensed appraisers are affiliated, such as by being employed by the same appraisal firm, then whether they have conducted the appraisal independently of each other must be determined based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case known to the creditor.
