##### ยง 3.1 Purpose, applicability, reservations of authority, and timing.
###### Consolidation of certain exposures.

(5)The OCC may determine that the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure or the treatment provided to an entity that is not consolidated on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet is not commensurate with the risk of the exposure and the relationship of the national bank or Federal savings association to the entity. Upon making this determination, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated on the balance sheet of the national bank or Federal savings association for purposes of determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirements and calculating the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital ratios accordingly. The OCC will look to the substance of, and risk associated with, the transaction, as well as other relevant factors the OCC deems appropriate in determining whether to require such treatment.
