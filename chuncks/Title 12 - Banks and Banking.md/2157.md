###### Excess dividends in prior periods.

(2)(i) If in current year minus one or current year minus two the bank declared dividends in excess of that year's net income, the excess does not reduce retained net income for the three-year period specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that the amount of excess dividends can be offset by retained net income in current year minus three or current year minus four. If the bank declared dividends in excess of net income in current year minus one, the excess is offset by retained net income in current year minus three and then by retained net income in current year minus two. If the bank declared dividends in excess of net income in current year minus two, the excess is first offset by retained net income in current year minus four and then by retained net income in current year minus three.

(ii) If the bank's retained net income in current year minus three and current year minus four was insufficient to offset the full amount of the excess dividends declared, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then the amount that is not offset will reduce the retained net income available to pay dividends in the current year.

(iii) The calculation in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies only to retained net loss that results from dividends declared in excess of a single year's net income and does not apply to other types of current earnings deficits.
