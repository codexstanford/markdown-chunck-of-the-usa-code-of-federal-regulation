#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Card issuer clarified.

1.Section 1026.58(b)(4) provides that, for purposes of § 1026.58, card issuer or issuer means the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a credit card agreement. For example, Bank X and Bank Y work together to issue credit cards. A consumer that obtains a credit card issued pursuant to this arrangement between Bank X and Bank Y is subject to an agreement that states "This is an agreement between you, the consumer, and Bank X that governs the terms of your Bank Y Credit Card." The card issuer in this example is Bank X, because the agreement creates a legally enforceable obligation between the consumer and Bank X. Bank X is the issuer even if the consumer applied for the card through a link on Bank Y's Web site and the cards prominently feature the Bank Y logo on the front of the card.
