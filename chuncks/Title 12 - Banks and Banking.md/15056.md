###### Rate that does not exceed rate that applied before decrease.

1.Once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies, ยง 226.55(b)(6) prohibits a card issuer from applying an annual percentage rate to any transactions that occurred prior to a decrease in rate pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 that exceeds the rate that applied to those transactions prior to the decrease. However, this provision does not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies, to the extent consistent with any of the other exceptions in ยง 226.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the decrease and that rate expired during the period that 50 U.S.C. app. 527 applied to the account, the card issuer may apply an increased rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies to the extent consistent with ยง 226.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the decrease, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies to the extent consistent with ยง 226.55(b)(2).
