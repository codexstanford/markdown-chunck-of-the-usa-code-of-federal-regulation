4.The exclusion for bona fide third-party charges not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate of either is limited by § 1026.32(b)(1)(iv) in the general definition of points and fees. Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iv) requires inclusion in points and fees of premiums and other charges for credit insurance and certain other types of insurance. If a charge is required to be included in points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1)(iv), it may not be excluded under § 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D), even if the criteria for exclusion in § 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) are satisfied.
