###### Interest rate sensitivity analysis.

(d)(1) A corporate credit union must:

(i) Evaluate the risk in its balance sheet by measuring, at least quarterly, including once on the last day of the calendar quarter, the impact of an instantaneous, permanent, and parallel shock in the yield curve of plus and minus 100, 200, and 300 BP on its NEV and NEV ratio. If the base case NEV ratio falls below 3 percent at the last testing date, these tests must be calculated at least monthly, including once on the last day of the month, until the base case NEV ratio again exceeds 3 percent;

(ii) Limit its risk exposure to levels that do not result in a base case NEV ratio or any NEV ratio resulting from the tests set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section below 2 percent; and

(iii) Limit its risk exposures to levels that do not result in a decline in NEV of more than 15 percent.

(2) A corporate credit union must assess annually if it should conduct periodic additional tests to address market factors that may materially impact that corporate credit union's NEV. These factors should include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve;

(ii) Adjustments to prepayment projections used for amortizing securities to consider the impact of significantly faster/slower prepayment speeds; and

(iii) Adjustments to volatility assumptions to consider the impact that changing volatilities have on embedded option values.
