####### Stock benefit plan limitations.

(e)The FDIC will presume that a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan that does not conform with the applicable percentage limitations of the regulations issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision constitutes excessive insider benefits and thereby evidences a breach of the board of directors' or trustees' fiduciary responsibility. In addition, no converted insured mutual state savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the conversion, implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock ownership plan, unless each of the following requirements is met:

(1) Each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering materials;

(2) All such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months after the completion of the conversion;

(3) In the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months following the stock issuance;

(4) For stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and

(5) For management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans.
