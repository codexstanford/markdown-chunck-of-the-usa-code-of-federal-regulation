###### Second tier.

For the second tier the credit union would pay between $134.75 and $841.45 in dividends, based on assumed balances of $2,500.01 and $15,000, respectively. For $2,500.01, dividends would be figured on $2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate plus dividends on $.01 at 5.50%. For the low end of the second tier, therefore, the annual percentage yield is 5.39%. Using the simple formula:

For $15,000, dividends are figured on $2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate plus dividends on $12,500 at 5.50% dividend rate. For the high end of the second tier, the annual percentage yield, using the simple formula, is 5.61%:

Thus, the annual percentage yield range that would be stated for the second tier is 5.39% to 5.61%.
