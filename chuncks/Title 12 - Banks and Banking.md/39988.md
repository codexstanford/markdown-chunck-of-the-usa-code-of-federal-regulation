#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Denied or withdrawn applications.

3.The creditor is not required to provide the disclosures required under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if, before the time the creditor is required to provide the disclosures under § 1026.19(f), the creditor determines the consumer's application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested, or the consumer has withdrawn the application, and, as such, the transaction will not be consummated. For transactions covered by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i), the creditor may rely on comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-3 in determining that disclosures are not required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) because the consumer's application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested or the consumer has withdrawn the application.
