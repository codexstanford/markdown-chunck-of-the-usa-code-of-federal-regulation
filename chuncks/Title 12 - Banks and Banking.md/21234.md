(a)Pursuant to section 7(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(a)) and other applicable law, every insured depository institution is required to file Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (also known as the Call Report) in accordance with the instructions for these reports. All assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities, must be reported in, or otherwise taken into account in the preparation of, the Call Report. The FDIC uses Call Report data from all insured depository institutions to calculate deposit insurance assessments and monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual banks and the banking industry. Reporting banks must also submit annually such information on small business and small farm lending as the FDIC may need to assess the availability of credit to these sectors of the economy. The report forms and instructions can be obtained from the Division of Insurance and Research (DIR), FDIC, 550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429 or through the website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council,
