###### Early compliance.

4.Credit unions that provide the notice to existing members prior to the compliance date of part 707, must be prepared to provide accurate and timely disclosures when, following receipt of the notice, members ask for account disclosures. Such disclosures must be provided even if they are requested before the compliance date of part 707. Credit unions who provide early notice to existing members need to comply with other aspects of part 707, but need not provide disclosures already provided in compliance with part 707.
