####### Step 4:

Make the linear adjustment. You make the adjustment by increasing the loss-frequency probability where the dampened stressed farmland value input is less than -16.69 percent to reflect the stressed farmland value input, appropriately discounted. As discussed previously, the stressed land value input is discounted to reflect the declining effect that the maximum land value decline has on the probability of default when it occurs later in a loan's life.The linear adjustment is the difference between -16.69 percent land value decline and the adjusted stressed maximum land value decline input of -23.52 multiplied by the slope estimated in Step 3 as follows:
