The periodic statement must also include an explanation that the reinstatement amount will be accepted to reinstate the loan through the "as of [date]" or "good through [date]," as applicable, along with any special instructions for submitting the payment. The explanation should be on the front page of the statement or, alternatively, may be included on a separate page enclosed with the periodic statement. The explanation may include related information, such as a statement that the amount disclosed is "not a payoff amount."
