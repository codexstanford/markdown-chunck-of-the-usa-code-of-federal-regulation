#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### General.

1.The calculation of total annual loan cost rates under appendix K is based on the principles set forth and the estimation or "iteration" procedure used to compute annual percentage rates under appendix J. Rather than restate this iteration process in full, the regulation cross-references the procedures found in appendix J. In other aspects the appendix reflects the special nature of reverse mortgage transactions. Special definitions and instructions are included where appropriate.
