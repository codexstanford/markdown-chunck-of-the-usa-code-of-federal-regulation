#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Alternate property address.

1.Section 1026.38(l)(6) requires disclosure of the address for the property that secures the credit, including the zip code. If the address is unavailable, § 1026.38(l)(6) requires disclosure of other location information for the property, such as a lot number; however, disclosure of a zip code is required in all instances. For transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan, the creditor may disclose as other location information a lot, square, or other such number or other legal description of the property assigned by the local governing authority, or if no such number or description is available, disclose the name of the timeshare property or properties with a designation indicating that the property is an interest in a timeshare plan.
