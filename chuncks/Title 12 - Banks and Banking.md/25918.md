###### Banking or Related Financial Management Expertise.

32.At least two members of the audit committee of a large institution shall have "banking or related financial management expertise" as required by section 36(g)(1)(C)(i). This determination is to be made by the board of directors of the insured depository institution. A person will be considered to have such required expertise if the person has significant executive, professional, educational, or regulatory experience in financial, auditing, accounting, or banking matters as determined by the board of directors. Significant experience as an officer or member of the board of directors or audit committee of a financial services company would satisfy these criteria. A person who has the attributes of an "audit committee financial expert" as set forth in the SEC's rules would also satisfy these criteria.
