###### Relation to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D.

1.Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D permits, in limited circumstances, the withdrawal of funds without penalty during the first six days after a "time deposit" is opened. (See 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1)(i).) But the fact that a member makes a withdrawal as permitted by Regulation D does not disqualify the account from being a term share account for purposes of this regulation (such as withdrawals upon the death of the member, or within a "grace period" for automatically renewable term share accounts).
