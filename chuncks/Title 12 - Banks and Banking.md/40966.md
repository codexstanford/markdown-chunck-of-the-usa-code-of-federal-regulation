#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Simultaneous subordinate financing.

ii.For simultaneous subordinate financing transactions, no sale price will be disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(1)(ii), and therefore no sale price will be included in the closing costs financed calculation as a payment to third parties. The total amount of payments to third parties only includes payments occurring in the simultaneous subordinate financing transaction other than payments toward the sale price.
