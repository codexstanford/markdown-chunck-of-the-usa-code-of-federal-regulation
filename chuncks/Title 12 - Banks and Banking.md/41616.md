##### Alternative to creditor's offer.

2.Section 1026.43(g)(4)(ii) requires that the creditor provide, by agreement, for the mortgage broker to present the consumer an alternative covered transaction that satisfies the requirements of § 1026.43(g)(3) offered by either the creditor or by another creditor, if the other creditor offers a covered transaction with a lower interest rate or a lower total dollar amount of discount points and origination points or fees. The agreement may provide for the mortgage broker to present both the creditor's covered transaction and an alternative covered transaction offered by another creditor with a lower interest rate or a lower total dollar amount of origination discount points and points or fees. See comment 36(e)(3)-3 for guidance in determining which step-rate mortgage has a lower interest rate.
