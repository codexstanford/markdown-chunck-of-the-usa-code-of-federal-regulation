###### Model C-12 Exception hold notice.

2.This model satisfies the written notice required under ยง 229.13(g) when a bank places a hold based on a ยง 229.13 exception. If a hold is being placed on more than one check in a deposit, each check need not be described, but if different reasons apply, each reason must be indicated. A bank may use the actual date when funds will be available for withdrawal rather than the number of the business day following the day of deposit. A bank must incorporate in the notice the material set out in brackets if it imposes overdraft or returned check fees after invoking the reasonable cause exception under ยง 229.13(e).
