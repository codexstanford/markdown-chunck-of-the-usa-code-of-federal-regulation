##### Translation.

7.Section 1026.38(t)(5)(viii) permits the translation of form H-25 into languages other than English, similar to § 1026.37(o)(5)(ii). Pursuant § 1026.38(t)(5)(viii) creditors may modify form H-25 to the extent that translation prevents the headings, labels, designations, and required disclosure items under § 1026.38 from fitting in the space provided on form H-25. For example, if the translation of a required label does not fit within the line provided for such label in form H-25, the label may be disclosed over two lines. See form H-28 of appendix H to this part for Spanish translations of form H-25.
