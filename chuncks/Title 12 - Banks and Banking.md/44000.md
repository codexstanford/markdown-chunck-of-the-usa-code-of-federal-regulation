##### § 1202.5 How do I request information from FHFA under the FOIA?
###### Agreement to pay fees.

(g)In your FOIA request you must acknowledge that you are aware of the applicable fees charged under § 1202.11, and specify an amount, if any, you are willing to pay without consultation. Your inability to pay a fee does not justify granting a fee waiver. The fact that FHFA withholds all responsive documents or does not locate any documents responsive to your request, does not mean that you are not responsible for paying applicable fees. Your FOIA request will not be considered received by FHFA until your acknowledgement of the applicable fees, in writing, is received. FHFA will notify a requester of any fees above $25.00.
