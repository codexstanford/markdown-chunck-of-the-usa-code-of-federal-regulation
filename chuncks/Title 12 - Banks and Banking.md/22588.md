######## Eligible purchased wholesale exposures.

(4)An FDIC-supervised institution must assign a PD, LGD, EAD, and M to each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures. If the FDIC-supervised institution can estimate ECL (but not PD or LGD) for a segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume that the LGD of the segment equals 100 percent and that the PD of the segment equals ECL divided by EAD. The estimated ECL must be calculated for the exposures without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.
