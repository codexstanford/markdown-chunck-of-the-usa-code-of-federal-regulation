###### State-chartered credit unions with interest-bearing deposit accounts.

2.State law controls the nature of accounts (i.e., whether an account is a share account or a deposit account). If a member of a state-chartered credit union is opening only an interest-bearing deposit account, or is requesting account disclosures only for an interest-bearing deposit account (if state law requires the depositor to hold a share account), the disclosures must generally include the following information on any dividend-bearing share portion of the account (e.g., membership share): the par value of a share; a statement that the portion of the deposit that represents the par value of the membership share will earn dividends, and that dividends are paid from current income and available earnings after required transfers to reserves. Further additional disclosures, such as a separate dividend rate and annual percentage yield for the membership share, are not required (if the additional disclosures would agree with the remainder of the account which is invested in an interest-bearing deposit).
