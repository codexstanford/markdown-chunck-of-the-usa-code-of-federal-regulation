####### Standard conditions

(bb)means the conditions that the FDIC may impose as a routine matter when approving a filing, whether or not the applicant has agreed to their inclusion. The following conditions, or variations thereof, are standard conditions:

(1) That the applicant has obtained all necessary and final approvals from the appropriate federal or state authority or other appropriate authority;

(2) That if the transaction does not take effect within a specified time period, or unless, in the meantime, a request for an extension of time has been approved, the consent granted shall expire at the end of the specified time period;

(3) That until the conditional commitment of the FDIC becomes effective, the FDIC retains the right to alter, suspend or withdraw its commitment should any interim development be deemed to warrant such action; and

(4) In the case of a merger transaction (as defined in &#xB6; 303.61(a) of this part), including a corporate reorganization, that the proposed transaction not be consummated before the 30th calendar day (or shorter time period as may be prescribed by the FDIC with the concurrence of the Attorney General) after the date of the order approving the merger transaction.
