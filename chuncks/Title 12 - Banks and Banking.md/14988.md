###### Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent during first year.

B.Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on May 25 of year one is not received by the card issuer until July 30 of year one. Because the card issuer received the required minimum periodic payment more than 60 days after the payment due date, ยง 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to increase the annual percentage rate applicable to the $2,000 purchase, the $500 cash advance, and future purchases and cash advances. However, ยง 226.55(b)(4)(i) requires the card issuer to first comply with the notice requirements in ยง 226.9(g). Thus, if the card issuer provided a ยง 226.9(g) notice on July 25 stating that all rates on the account would be increased to the 30% penalty rate, the card issuer could apply that rate beginning on September 8 to all balances and to future transactions.
