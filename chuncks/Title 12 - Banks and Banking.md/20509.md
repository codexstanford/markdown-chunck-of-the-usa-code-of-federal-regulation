#### PART 267 - PROCEDURES FOR DEBT COLLECTION
##### ยง 267.1 Purpose and scope.

This part establishes Board procedures for the collection of certain debts owed to the United States.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part applies to collections by the Board from persons, organizations, or entities indebted to the United States.

(b) This part does not apply to any debts whose collection is exclusively provided for or prohibited by another statute or applicable regulation, or to any debt of a current Board employee or other debtor where the Board has chosen to proceed solely under its existing internal debt collection policy. This part does not in any way limit or affect the Board's authority under 12 U.S.C. 244 and 12 U.S.C. 248. Nothing in this part precludes the collection of debts through any other legally-available means, or precludes the Board from engaging in litigation as provided under 12 U.S.C. 248(p), 1818(i), or any other applicable law.

(c) When the Board determines to collect a debt using the procedures under these regulations, in addition to the procedures set forth in this part and subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the Board shall also follow, as applicable, the procedures set forth in 31 CFR part 285 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS) (31 CFR chapter IX and parts 900 through 904) for the collection of debts owed to the United States.
