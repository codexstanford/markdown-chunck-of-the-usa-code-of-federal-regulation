##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### General.

A.A refinancing or assumption as defined in ยง 226.20(a) or (b) is a new transaction and is covered by a provision of the final rules if the creditor receives an application for the transaction on or after that provision's effective date. For example, if a creditor receives an application for a refinance loan covered by ยง 226.35(a) on or after October 1, 2009, and the refinance loan is consummated on October 15, 2009, the provision restricting prepayment penalties in ยง 226.35(b)(2) applies. However, if the transaction were a modification of an existing obligation's terms that does not constitute a refinance loan under ยง 226.20(a), the final rules, including for example the restriction on prepayment penalties, would not apply.
