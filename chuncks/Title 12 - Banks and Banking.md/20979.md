####### Notice within 90 days after receiving notice of the event giving rise to the acquisition of control.

(b)The following acquisitions of control of a covered institution, which otherwise would require prior notice under this subpart, instead require the person acquiring control to provide to the appropriate FDIC office, within 90 calendar days after receiving notice of the event giving rise to the acquisition of control, all relevant information requested by the FDIC:

(1) The acquisition of control resulting from a redemption of voting securities by the issuing covered institution; and

(2) The acquisition of control as a result of any event or action (including without limitation the sale of securities) by any third party that is not within the control of the person acquiring control.

(c) The FDIC may disapprove a notice filed after an acquisition of control, and nothing in this section limits the authority of the FDIC to disapprove a notice pursuant to ยง 303.86(c).

(d) The relevant information that the FDIC may require under this section may include all information and documents routinely required for a prior notice as provided in ยง 303.85.

(e) If the FDIC disapproves a Notice filed under this ยง 303.83, the notificant(s) must divest control of the covered institution which may include, without limitation, disposing of some or all of the voting securities so that the notificant(s) is no longer in control of the covered institution, within such period of time and in the manner that the FDIC may determine.
