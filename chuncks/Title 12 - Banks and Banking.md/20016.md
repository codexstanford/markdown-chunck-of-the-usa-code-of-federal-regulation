####### Contents.

(b)The Board commences a suspension, removal, or prohibition action under this subpart with the issuance, and service upon an institution-affiliated party, of a notice of suspension from office, or order of removal from office, or notice or order of prohibition from participation in the financial institution's affairs. Such a notice or order shall indicate the basis for the suspension, removal, or prohibition and shall inform the institution-affiliated party of the right to request in writing, within 30 days of service of the notice or order, an opportunity to show at an informal hearing that continued service to, or participation in the conduct of the affairs of, the financial institution does not and is not likely to pose a threat to the interests of the financial institution's depositors or threaten to impair public confidence in the financial institution. Failure to file a timely request for an informal hearing shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to request such a hearing. A notice of suspension or prohibition shall remain in effect until the criminal charge upon which the notice is based is finally disposed of or until the notice is terminated by the Board.
