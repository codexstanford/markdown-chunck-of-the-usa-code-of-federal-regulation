###### Circumstances.

1.The circumstances under which the rate may increase include identification of any index to which the rate is tied, as well as any conditions or events on which the increase is contingent.

- When no specific index is used, any identifiable factors used to determine whether to increase the rate must be disclosed.

- When the increase in the rate is purely discretionary, the fact that any increase is within the creditor's discretion must be disclosed.

- When the index is internally defined (for example, by that creditor's prime rate), the creditor may comply with this requirement by either a brief description of that index or a statement that any increase is in the discretion of the creditor. An externally defined index, however, must be identified.
