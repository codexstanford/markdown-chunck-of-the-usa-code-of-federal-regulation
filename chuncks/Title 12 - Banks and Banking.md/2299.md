#### Subpart A - National Bank and Federal Savings Association Powers
##### ยง 7.1023 Federal savings associations, prohibition on industrial or commercial metal dealing or investing.
###### Nonconforming holdings.

(d)Federal savings associations that hold industrial or commercial metal as a result of dealing or investing in that metal must dispose of such metal as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from April 1, 2018. The OCC may grant up to four separate one-year extensions to dispose of industrial or commercial metal if a Federal savings association makes a good faith effort to dispose of the metal and retention of the metal for an additional year is not inconsistent with safe and sound operation of the association.
