###### Interpretations
####### ยง 225.139 Presumption of continued control under section 2(g)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act.
######## transferor,transferee,,subsidiary

(1) The termsandas used in section 2(g)(3), include parents and subsidiaries of each. Thus, for example, where a transferee is indebted to a subsidiary of the transferor, or where a specified interlocking relationship exists between the transferor or transferee and a subsidiary of the other (or between subsidiaries of each), the presumption arises. Similarly, if a parent of the transferee is indebted to a parent of the transferor, the presumption arises. The presumption of continued control also arises where an interlock or debt relationship is retained between the divesting company and the company being divested, since the divested company will be or may be viewed as aof the transferee or group of transferees.
