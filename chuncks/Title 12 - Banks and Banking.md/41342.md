#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Agents of the creditor.

1.Whether a person is an agent of the creditor is determined by applicable law; however, a "fee appraiser" as defined in paragraph (f)(4)(i) is not an agent of the creditor for purposes of paragraph (f), and therefore is not required to pay other fee appraisers customary and reasonable compensation under paragraph (f).
