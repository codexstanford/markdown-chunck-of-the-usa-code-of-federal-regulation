#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Mergers and acquisitions.

1.A qualified mortgage under § 1026.43(f)(1) retains its qualified mortgage status if a creditor merges with, is acquired by another person, or acquires another person regardless of whether the creditor or its successor is eligible to originate new balloon-payment qualified mortgages under § 1026.43(f)(1) after the merger or acquisition. However, the creditor or its successor can originate new balloon-payment qualified mortgages under § 1026.43(f)(1) only if it complies with all of the requirements of § 1026.43(f)(1) after the merger or acquisition. For example, assume a small creditor that originates 250 first-lien covered transactions each year and originates balloon-payment qualified mortgages under § 1026.43(f)(1) is acquired by a larger creditor that originates 10,000 first-lien covered transactions each year. Following the acquisition, the small creditor would no longer be able to originate balloon-payment qualified mortgages because, together with its affiliates, it would originate more than 500 first-lien covered transactions each year. However, the balloon-payment qualified mortgages originated by the small creditor before the acquisition would retain their qualified mortgage status.
