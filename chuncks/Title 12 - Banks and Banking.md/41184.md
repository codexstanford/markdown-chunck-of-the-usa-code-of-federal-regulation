#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Assumed advances.

6.The creditor should assume that the $10,000 balance is an advance taken at the beginning of the first billing cycle and is reduced according to the terms of the plan, and that the consumer takes no subsequent draws. As discussed in the commentary to § 1026.40(d)(5), creditors should not assume an additional advance is taken at the beginning of any repayment period. If applicable, the creditor may assume the $10,000 is both the advance and the credit limit. (See the commentary to § 1026.40(d)(5) for a discussion of the circumstances in which a creditor may use a lower outstanding balance.)
