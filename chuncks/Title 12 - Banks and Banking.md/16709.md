####### Intraday exposures.

(3)The covered savings and loan holding company must establish and maintain procedures for monitoring intraday liquidity risk exposures that are consistent with the covered savings and loan holding company's capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size.

(i) Monitor and measure expected daily gross liquidity inflows and outflows;

(ii) Manage and transfer collateral to obtain intraday credit;

(iii) Identify and prioritize time-specific obligations so that the covered savings and loan holding company can meet these obligations as expected and settle less critical obligations as soon as possible;

(iv) Manage the issuance of credit to customers where necessary; and

(v) Consider the amounts of collateral and liquidity needed to meet payment systems obligations when assessing the covered savings and loan holding company's overall liquidity needs.
