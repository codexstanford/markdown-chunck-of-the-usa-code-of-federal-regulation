1.The importance of the dividend declaration date is to tie the last paid dividend to a certain period of time to place members and potential members on notice that the last paid dividend is different from the next dividend to be paid. In order to achieve this purpose, a credit union may use any of the following methods:

i. "As of 3/15/95" (the date the board of directors last met and declared the last paid dividend).

ii. "As of 3/31/95" (the last day of the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).

iii. "For the period 1/1/95 to 3/31/95" (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).

iv. "For the first quarter of 1995" (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).

v. "For April 1995" (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).

vi. "As of the last dividend declaration date" (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
