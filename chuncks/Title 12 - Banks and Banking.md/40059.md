### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Amortization statement.

1.For ARMs requiring the payment of interest only, such as interest-only loans, § 1026.20(c)(2)(vi) requires a statement that the new payment covers all of the interest but none of the principal, and therefore will not reduce the loan balance. For negatively-amortizing ARMs, § 1026.20(c)(2)(vi) requires a statement that the new payment covers only part of the interest and none of the principal, and therefore the unpaid interest will be added to the principal balance.
