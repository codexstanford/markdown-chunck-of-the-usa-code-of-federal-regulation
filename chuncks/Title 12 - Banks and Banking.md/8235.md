(e)This paragraph makes clear that financial messaging standards, including the financial messaging components, elements, technical documentation, tags, and terminology used to implement those standards, do not confer or connote legal status or responsibilities. Instead, subpart B of this part and Federal Reserve Bank operating circulars govern the rights and obligations of parties to funds transfers sent through the Fedwire Funds Service as provided in ยง 210.25(b). Thus, to the extent there is any inconsistency between a financial messaging standard adopted by the Fedwire Funds Service and subpart B of this part, subpart B of this part, including Article 4A as adopted in appendix B to subpart B of this part, will prevail. In the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, for example, the termis used to refer to a variety of bank parties to a funds transfer (). Notwithstanding use of that term in the standard and in message tags, such banks are not the agents of any party to a funds transfer and owe no duty to any other party to such a funds transfer except as provided in subpart B of this part (including Article 4A) or by express agreement. The ISO 20022 financial messaging standard also permits information to be carried in a funds-transfer message regarding persons that are not parties to that funds transfer () for regulatory, compliance, remittance, or other purposes. An "ultimate debtor" is not an "originator" as defined in Article 4A. The relationship between the ultimate debtor and the originator (what the ISO 20022 standard calls the "debtor") is determined by law other than Article 4A.
