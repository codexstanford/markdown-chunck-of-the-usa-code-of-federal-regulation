###### Change in circumstances.

(6)If, after a decision is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances affecting the corporate credit union's capital adequacy or its ability to reach its required minimum capital level by the specified date, the NCUA may amend the individual minimum capital requirement or the corporate credit union's schedule for such compliance. The NCUA may decline to consider a corporate credit union's request for such changes that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or that are repetitive or frivolous. Pending the NCUA's reexamination of the original decision, that original decision and any compliance schedule established in that decision will continue in full force and effect.
