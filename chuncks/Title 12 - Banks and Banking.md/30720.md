###### Enterprise risk management

means the process of addressing risk on an entity-wide basis. The purpose of this process is not to eliminate risk but, rather, to provide the knowledge the board of directors and management need to effectively measure, monitor, and control risk and to then plan appropriate strategies to achieve the entity's business objectives with a reasonable amount of risk taking.
