####### Grounds for rejection of capital plan.

(b)NCUA may reject a capital plan if it determines that:

(1) The covered credit union has material unresolved supervisory issues associated with its capital planning process;

(2) The capital analysis underlying the covered credit union's capital plan, or the covered credit union's methodologies for reviewing the robustness of its capital adequacy, are not reasonable or appropriate;

(3) Data utilized for the capital analysis is insufficiently detailed to capture the risks of the covered credit union, or the data lacks integrity;

(4) The plan does not meet all of the requirements of ยง 702.304;

(5) Unacceptable weakness in the capital plan or policy, the capital planning analysis, or any critical system or process supporting capital analysis;

(6) The covered credit union's capital planning process constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, NCUA order, directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, NCUA. In determining whether a capital plan would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice, NCUA considers whether the covered credit union is and would remain in sound financial condition after giving effect to the capital plan.
