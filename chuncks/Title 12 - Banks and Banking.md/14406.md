3.The table or schedule must state all the necessary information for a representative sampling of amounts of credit. This must reflect amounts of credit the creditor actually offers, up to and including the higher-priced items. This does not mean that the chart must make the disclosures for the single most expensive item the seller offers, but only that the chart cannot be limited to information about less expensive sales when the seller commonly offers a distinct level of more expensive goods or services. The range of transactions shown in the table or schedule in a particular catalog or multiple-page advertisement need not exceed the range of transactions actually offered in that advertisement.
