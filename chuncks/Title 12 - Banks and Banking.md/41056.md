## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Clear and conspicuous; segregation.

1.The clear and conspicuous standard requires that the disclosures required by § 1026.38 be legible and in a readily understandable form. The disclosures also must be grouped together and segregated from everything else. As required by § 1026.38(t)(3), the disclosures for any transaction that is a federally related mortgage loan under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2, must be made using the standard form H-25 of appendix H to this part. Accordingly, use of that form constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of § 1026.38(t)(1).
