###### Basis of disclosures.

1.Disclosures must reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. For example:

i. In a three-year lease with no penalty for termination after a one-year minimum term, disclosures are based on the full three-year term of the lease. The one-year minimum term is only relevant to the early termination provisions of §§ 213.4 (g)(1), (k) and (l).
