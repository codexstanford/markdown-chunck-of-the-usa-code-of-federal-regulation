###### In general.

1.Section 226.18(s) prescribes format and content for disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments for mortgage loans. The information in ยง 226.18(s)(2)-(4) is required to be in the form of a table, except as otherwise provided, with headings and format substantially similar to Model Clause H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H) in Appendix H to this part. A disclosure that does not include the shading shown in a model clause but otherwise follows the model clause's headings and format is substantially similar to that model clause. Where ยง 226.18(s)(2)-(4) or the applicable model clause requires that a column or row of the table be labeled using the word "monthly" but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the appropriate term, such as "bi-weekly" or "quarterly." In all cases, the table should have no more than five vertical columns corresponding to applicable interest rates at various times during the loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in horizontal rows. Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes of ยง 226.18(s) in ยง 226.18(s)(7).
