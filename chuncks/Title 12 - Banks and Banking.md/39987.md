#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Settlement agent.

iii.If a settlement agent provides disclosures required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) three business days before consummation pursuant to § 1026.19(f)(1)(v), the "best information reasonably available" standard applies to terms for which the actual term is unknown to the settlement agent at the time the disclosures are provided. The settlement agent normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information, but if information about actual terms is not reasonably available, the settlement agent also must satisfy the "best information reasonably available" standard. Accordingly, the settlement agent is required to exercise due diligence to obtain information if it is providing the Closing Disclosure pursuant to § 1026.19(f)(1)(v). For example, for the loan terms table required to be disclosed under § 1026.38(b), the settlement agent would be considered to have exercised due diligence if it obtained such information from the creditor. Because the creditor remains responsible under § 1026.19(f)(1)(v) for ensuring that the Closing Disclosure is provided in accordance with § 1026.19(f), the creditor is expected to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor. See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-3 for guidance on a creditor's responsibilities where a settlement agent provides disclosures.
