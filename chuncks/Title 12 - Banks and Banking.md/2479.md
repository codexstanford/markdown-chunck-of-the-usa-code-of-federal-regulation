### PART 8 - ASSESSMENT OF FEES
#### ยง 8.2 Semiannual assessment.

(a) Each national bank and each Federal savings association shall pay to the OCC a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The OCC will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each national bank and each Federal savings association no later than 7 business days prior to collection on March 31 and September 30 of each year. In setting assessments, the OCC may take into account the nature and scope of the activities of a national bank or Federal savings association, the amount and type of assets that the entity holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity, and any other factor the OCC determines is appropriate, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 16. The semiannual assessment will be calculated as follows:

(1) Every national bank and every Federal savings association falls into one of the asset-size brackets denoted by Columns A and B. A national bank's or Federal savings association's semiannual assessment is composed of two parts. The first part is the calculation of a base amount of the assessment, which is computed on the assets of the national bank or Federal savings association up to the lower endpoint (Column A) of the bracket in which it falls. This base amount of the assessment is calculated by the OCC in Column C.

(2) The second part is the calculation of assessments due on the remaining assets of the national bank or Federal savings association in excess of Column E. The excess is assessed at the marginal rate shown in Column D.

(3) The total semiannual assessment is the amount in Column C, plus the amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's assets in excess of Column E times the marginal rate in Column D:

(4) Each year, the OCC may index the marginal rates in Column D to adjust for the percent change in the level of prices, as measured by changes in the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator (GDPIPD) for each June-to-June period. The OCC may at its discretion adjust marginal rates by amounts other than the percentage change in the GDPIPD. The OCC will also adjust the amounts in Column C to reflect any change made to the marginal rate.

(5)(i) The specific marginal rates and complete assessment schedule will be published in the "Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments," provided for at ยง 8.8. Each semiannual assessment is based upon the total assets shown in the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent "Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income" (Call Report) preceding the payment date. Each national bank or Federal savings association subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC on the date of the second or fourth quarterly Call Report as appropriate, required by the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 161 and 12 U.S.C. 1464(v), is subject to the full assessment for the next six-month period. National banks and Federal savings associations that are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC as of the date of the first or third quarterly Call Report, as appropriate, will receive a refund of assessments for the second three months of the semiannual assessment period.

(ii) [Reserved]

(6)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead national bank or non-lead Federal savings association by a percentage that it will specify in the "Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments" described in ยง 8.8.

(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(6):
