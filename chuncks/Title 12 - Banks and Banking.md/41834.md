#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Penalty rate increase.

B.Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 is received on August 30. At this time, § 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to increase the annual percentage rates that apply to the $1,000 purchase balance, the $200 purchase, or the $100 purchase. Instead, those rates can only be increased as discussed in paragraph iii.A above. However, if the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 1026.9(c) or (g) on September 1, § 1026.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to apply an increased rate (such as the 17% purchase rate or the 30% penalty rate) to transactions that occur on or after September 16 beginning on October 16.
