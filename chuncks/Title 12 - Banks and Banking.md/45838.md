####### Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized OTC derivative contracts.

(c)(1) An Enterprise may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) by using the simple approach in § 1240.39(b).

(2) As an alternative to the simple approach, an Enterprise may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting set if the financial collateral is marked-to-fair value on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement by applying a risk weight to the uncollateralized portion of the exposure, after adjusting the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section using the collateral haircut approach in § 1240.39(c). The Enterprise must substitute the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for ΣE in the equation in § 1240.39(c)(2).
