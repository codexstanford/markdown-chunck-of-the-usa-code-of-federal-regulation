###### Net assets

means total assets less Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) stock subscriptions, CLF-related bridge loans, loans guaranteed by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), and member reverse repurchase transactions. For its own account, a corporate credit union's payables under reverse repurchase agreements and receivables under repurchase agreements may be netted out if the GAAP conditions for offsetting are met. Also, any amounts deducted in calculating Tier 1 capital are also deducted from net assets.
