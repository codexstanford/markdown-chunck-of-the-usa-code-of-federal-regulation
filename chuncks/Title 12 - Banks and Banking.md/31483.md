###### Totals for the calendar year to date.

6.Some credit unions' statement periods do not coincide with the calendar month. In such cases, the credit union may disclose a calendar year-to-date total by aggregating fees for 12 monthly cycles, starting with the period that begins during January and finishing with the period that begins during December. For example, if statement periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering December 10, 2006 through January 9, 2007 may disclose the year-to-date total for fees imposed from January 10, 2006 through January 9, 2007. Alternatively, the credit union could provide a statement for the cycle ending January 9, 2007, showing the year-to-date total for fees imposed January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
