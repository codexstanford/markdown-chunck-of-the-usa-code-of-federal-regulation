####### Scope.

(a)(1) This subpart implements section 11(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1468(a)). Section 11(a) applies sections 23A and 23B of the FRA (12 U.S.C. 371c and 371c1) to every savings association in the same manner and to the same extent as if the association were a member bank; prohibits certain types of transactions with affiliates; and authorizes the Board to impose additional restrictions on a savings association's transactions with affiliates.

(2) For the purposes of this subpart, "savings association" is defined at section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813), and also includes any savings bank or any cooperative bank that is a savings association under 12 U.S.C. 1467a(l). A non-affiliate subsidiary of a savings association is treated as part of the savings association. For purposes of this subpart, a "non-affiliate subsidiary" is a subsidiary of a savings association other than a subsidiary described at 12 CFR 223.2(b)(1)(i), and (b)(1)(iii) through (v).
