###### Inapplicability of closed-end rules.

8.Advertisements for home-equity plans are governed solely by the requirements in § 226.16, except § 226.16(g), and not by the closed-end advertising rules in § 226.24. Thus, if a creditor states payment information about the repayment phase, this will trigger the duty to provide additional information under § 226.16, but not under § 226.24.
