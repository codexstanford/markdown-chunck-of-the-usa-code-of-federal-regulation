##### § 1202.9 How do I appeal a response denying my FOIA request?
###### Timing, form, content, and receipt of an appeal.

(b)Your written appeal must be postmarked or submitted within 90 calendar days of the date of the decision by FHFA denying, in whole or in part, your request. Your appeal must include a copy of the initial request, a copy of the letter denying the request in whole or in part, and a statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments you believe support disclosure of the requested record(s). FHFA will not consider an improperly addressed appeal to have been received for the purposes of the 20-day time period of paragraph (d) of this section until it is actually received by the correct FHFA component.
