(2)When a person to whom a credit obligation is initially payable grants, extends, or provides credit to a consumer for the purpose of financing the purchase of an automobile from an auto dealer or other party that is not affiliated with the person, any requirement to provide a risk-based pricing notice pursuant to this subpart is satisfied if the person:

(i) Provides a notice described in § 222.72(a), § 222.74(e), or § 222.74(f) to the consumer within the time periods set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, § 222.74(e)(3), or § 222.74(f)(4), as applicable; or

(ii) Arranges to have the auto dealer or other party provide a notice described in § 222.72(a), § 222.74(e), or § 222.74(f) to the consumer on its behalf within the time periods set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, § 222.74(e)(3), or § 222.74(f)(4), as applicable, and maintains reasonable policies and procedures to verify that the auto dealer or other party provides such notice to the consumer within the applicable time periods. If the person arranges to have the auto dealer or other party provide a notice described in § 222.74(e), the person's obligation is satisfied if the consumer receives a notice containing a credit score obtained by the dealer or other party, even if a different credit score is obtained and used by the person on whose behalf the notice is provided.
