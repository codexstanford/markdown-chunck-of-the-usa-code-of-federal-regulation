###### Exceptions to the availability schedules.

California law provides exceptions to the state availability schedules for large deposits, new accounts, repeated overdrafters, doubtful collectibility, foreign items, and emergency conditions. In all cases where the federal availability schedule preempts the state schedule, only the federal exceptions will apply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule (e.g., in-state nonlocal checks under the temporary schedule; cashier's or teller's checks that are not deposited with a special deposit slip or at a staff teller station), the state exceptions may be used to extend the state availability schedule up to the federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held up to the federal availability limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold under any federal exception that can be applied to the deposit. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customer in accordance with ยง 229.13(g) of Regulation CC.
