#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Statements of tax deductibility.

3.An advertisement that refers to deductibility for tax purposes is not misleading if it includes a statement such as "consult a tax advisor regarding the deductibility of interest." An advertisement distributed in paper form or through the Internet (rather than by radio or television) that states that the advertised extension of credit may exceed the fair market value of the consumer's dwelling is not misleading if it clearly and conspicuously states the required information in §§ 1026.16(d)(4)(i) and (d)(4)(ii).
