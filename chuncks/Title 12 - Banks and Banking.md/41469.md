#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Renewable balloon-payment mortgage with a three-year loan term.

ii.Assume the same facts above in comment 43(c)(5)(ii)(A)-4.i, except that the loan agreement also provides that the creditor is unconditionally obligated to renew the balloon-payment mortgage at the consumer's option at the end of the three-year term for another three years. In determining the maximum payment scheduled during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due, the creditor must use a loan term of three years. Accordingly, for purposes of § 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must determine the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on the balloon payment of $193,367.
