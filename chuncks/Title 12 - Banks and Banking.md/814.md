###### § 3.145 Recognition of credit risk mitigants for securitization exposures.
####### Collateral,Rules of recognition.

(b)-(1)A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize financial collateral in determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure (other than a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, or an OTC derivative contract for which the national bank or Federal savings association has reflected collateral in its determination of exposure amount under § 3.132) as follows. The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for the collateralized securitization exposure is equal to the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure as calculated under the SSFA in § 3.144 or under the SFA in § 3.143 multiplied by the ratio of adjusted exposure amount (SE*) to original exposure amount (SE),

(i) SE* = max {0, [SE-C x (1-H-H)]};

(ii) SE = the amount of the securitization exposure calculated under § 3.142(e);

(iii) C = the current fair value of the collateral;

(iv) H= the haircut appropriate to the collateral type; and

(v) H= the haircut appropriate for any currency mismatch between the collateral and the exposure.
