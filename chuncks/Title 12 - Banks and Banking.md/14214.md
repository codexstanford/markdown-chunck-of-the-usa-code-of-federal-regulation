###### Examples of waivers made after the seven-business-day waiting period.

3.Assume the early disclosures are delivered to the consumer in person on Monday, June 1 and consummation is scheduled for Friday, June 19. On Wednesday, June 17, a change to the annual percentage rate occurs:

i. If the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures is inaccurate under ยง 226.22, the creditor must provide a corrected disclosure to the consumer before consummation, which triggers the three-business-day waiting period in ยง 226.19(a)(2). After the consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a waiver of the three-business-day waiting period in order to consummate the transaction on Friday, June 19.

ii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures inaccurate under ยง 226.22, the creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent with ยง 226.17(f). Disclosure of the changed terms does not trigger an additional waiting period, and the transaction may be consummated on Friday, June 19 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional modification or waiver.
