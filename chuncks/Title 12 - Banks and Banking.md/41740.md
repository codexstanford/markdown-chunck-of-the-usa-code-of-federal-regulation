##### Relationship between § 1026.52(b)(1) and (b)(2).

ii.Section 1026.52(b)(1) does not permit a card issuer to impose a fee that is inconsistent with the prohibitions in § 1026.52(b)(2). For example, if § 1026.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee that exceeds $15, § 1026.52(b)(1)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to impose a higher late payment fee.
