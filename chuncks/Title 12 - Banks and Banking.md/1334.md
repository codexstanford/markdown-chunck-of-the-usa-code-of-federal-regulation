###### Expedited review.

(2)The OCC grants qualifying national banks and Federal savings associations expedited review within a specified time after filing or commencement of the public comment period for certain filings.

(i) The OCC may extend the expedited review period or remove a filing from expedited review procedures if it concludes that the filing, or an adverse comment regarding the filing, presents a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern or raises a significant legal or policy issue requiring additional OCC review. The OCC will provide the filer with a written explanation if it decides not to process an application from a qualifying national bank or Federal savings association under expedited review pursuant to this paragraph.
