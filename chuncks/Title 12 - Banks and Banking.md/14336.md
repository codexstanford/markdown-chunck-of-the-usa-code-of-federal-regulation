###### Consumer's exercise of right.

1.The consumer must exercise the right of rescission in writing but not necessarily on the notice supplied under ยง 226.23(b). Whatever the means of sending the notification of rescission-mail, telegram or other written means-the time period for the creditor's performance under ยง 226.23(d)(2) does not begin to run until the notification has been received. The creditor may designate an agent to receive the notification so long as the agent's name and address appear on the notice provided to the consumer under ยง 226.23(b). Where the creditor fails to provide the consumer with a designated address for sending the notification of rescission, delivering notification to the person or address to which the consumer has been directed to send, payments constitutes delivery to the creditor or assignee. State law determines whether delivery of the notification to a third party other than the person to whom payments are made is delivery to the creditor or assignee, in the case where the creditor fails to designate an address for sending the notification of rescission.
