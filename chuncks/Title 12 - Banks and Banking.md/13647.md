###### Brief identification-sufficiency of description.

6.The "brief identification" provision in ยง 226.8(a)(1)(i) requires a designation that will enable the consumer to reconcile the periodic statement with the consumer's own records. In determining the sufficiency of the description, the following rules apply:

i. While item-by-item descriptions are not necessary, reasonable precision is required. For example, "merchandise," "miscellaneous," "second-hand goods," or "promotional items" would not suffice.

ii. A reference to a department in a sales establishment that accurately conveys the identification of the types of property or services available in the department is sufficient-for example, "jewelry," or "sporting goods."

iii. A number or symbol that is related to an identification list printed elsewhere on the statement that reasonably identifies the transaction with the creditor is sufficient.
