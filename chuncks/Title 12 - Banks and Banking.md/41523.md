## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### General.

1.The 30-year term limitation in § 1026.43(e)(2)(ii) is applied without regard to any interim period between consummation and the beginning of the first full unit period of the repayment schedule. For example, assume a covered transaction is consummated on March 20, 2014 and the due date of the first regular periodic payment is April 30, 2014. The beginning of the first full unit period of the repayment schedule is April 1, 2014 and the loan term therefore ends on April 1, 2044. The transaction would comply with the 30-year term limitation in § 1026.43(e)(2)(ii).
