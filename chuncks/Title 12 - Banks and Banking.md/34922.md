### PART 1005-ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS (REGULATION E)
#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability-coverage.

5.Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) generally covers disputes about the failure to make funds available in connection with a remittance transfer to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability. If only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead. The following are examples of errors for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability (assuming that none of the exceptions in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) apply).

i. Late or non-delivery of a remittance transfer;

ii. Delivery of funds to the wrong account;

iii. The fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the designated recipient;

iv. The recipient agent or institution's retention of the remittance transfer, instead of making the funds available to the designated recipient.
