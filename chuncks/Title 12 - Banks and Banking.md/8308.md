(b)(1) Section 4A-209(b) provides that a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of certain specified events, including when the bank receives payment for the entire amount of the order from the sender (section 4A-209(b)(2)). Section 4A-404(a) provides that if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, it is obliged to pay the amount of a payment order to the beneficiary on the payment date unless acceptance of the payment order occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank. Section 4A-405(a) provides that if a beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary by crediting an account of the beneficiary on its own books, payment of the bank's obligation under Section 4A-404(a) occurs when and to the extent (i) the bank notifies the beneficiary that it may withdraw the amount of the credit, (ii) the bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary, or (iii) funds with respect to the payment order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank.

(2) Section 210.44(b)(1) provides that if a FedNow participant that is the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, it must pay the beneficiary by credit to the beneficiary's account in accordance with section 4A-405(a) of Article 4A, and it must do so immediately after its acceptance of the payment order. This section further clarifies that the provisions of the Expedited Funds Availability Act (12 U.S.C. 4002(a)) and its implementing regulation, Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229), also govern. Regulation CC provides that funds received by a bank by an electronic payment shall be available for withdrawal not later than the business day after the banking day on which such funds are received. (12 CFR 229.10(b).) Because Subpart C of this part requires funds to be made available on a more prompt basis than the availability requirements of the Expedited Funds Availability Act and Regulation CC, that act and Regulation CC do not preempt or invalidate subpart C. For example, if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order through the FedNow Service at 10 a.m. but does not make funds available to the beneficiary until 5 p.m., the bank has failed to satisfy its obligations under subpart C of this part even if it has satisfied its obligations under Regulation CC.

(3) Section 210.44(b)(2) clarifies that the obligation for the beneficiary's bank to provide immediate funds availability to the beneficiary under ยง 210.44(b)(1), and any Operating Circular issued in accordance with subpart C, should not be construed as creating any rights that the beneficiary or any party other than a Federal Reserve Bank may assert against the beneficiary's bank, or affect any liability of the beneficiary's bank to the beneficiary or any party other than a Federal Reserve Bank under Article 4A or other law. In the example above, where the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order through the FedNow Service at 10 a.m. but does not make funds available to the beneficiary until 5 p.m., the bank has failed to satisfy its obligations under ยง 210.44(b)(1) but the beneficiary would not have a claim or right to assert against the bank under that provision.

(4) Section 210.46(a) provides that payment by a Federal Reserve Bank to a receiving bank occurs when the receiving bank's settlement account is credited or when the payment order is sent by the Federal Reserve Bank to the receiving bank, whichever is earlier, and would ordinarily be considered acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank under section 4A-209(b). Section 210.44(b)(3) provides that notwithstanding section 4A-209(b), in certain circumstances a beneficiary's bank is not deemed to accept a payment order at such time as it receives payment from its Federal Reserve Bank. Specifically, where the beneficiary's bank has reasonable cause to believe that the beneficiary is not entitled or permitted to receive payment and the beneficiary's bank notifies its Federal Reserve Bank that it requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order, this section provides that for purposes of subpart C and Article 4A, the beneficiary's bank does not accept the payment order even if it has received payment for the entire amount of the order from its Federal Reserve Bank as provided in ยง 210.46.

For example, if the beneficiary's bank has reasonable cause to believe that making funds available to the beneficiary may violate applicable U.S. sanctions, the beneficiary's bank may notify its Federal Reserve Bank that it requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order, including to investigate if the beneficiary is subject to applicable sanctions. As an additional example, if the beneficiary's bank has reasonable cause to believe that a particular payment order may be related to fraudulent activity, the beneficiary's bank may notify its Federal Reserve Bank that it requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order, including to investigate the suspected fraudulent activity. In both examples, in the event the beneficiary's bank gives such notice, the beneficiary's bank would not be deemed to have accepted the payment order at the time it receives payment from its Federal Reserve Bank.
