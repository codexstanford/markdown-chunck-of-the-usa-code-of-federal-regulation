#### Subpart B-Initiation of Proceedings and Prehearing Rules
##### § 1081.208 Subpoenas.
###### Enforcing subpoenas.

(k)If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this part or any order of the hearing officer which directs compliance with all or any portion of a subpoena, the Bureau's General Counsel may, on its own motion or at the request of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, apply to an appropriate United States district court, in the name of the Bureau but on relation of such party, for an order requiring compliance with so much of the subpoena as the hearing officer has not quashed or modified, unless, in the judgment of the General Counsel, the enforcement of such subpoena would be inconsistent with law and the policies of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. Failure to request that the Bureau's General Counsel seek enforcement of a subpoena constitutes a waiver of any claim of prejudice predicated upon the unavailability of the testimony or evidence sought.
