### Subchapter A - Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
#### PART 226-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### 1981 changes:

With few exceptions, the disclosures must now appear apart from all other information, and may not be interspersed with that information. The disclosures must be based on the legal obligation between the parties, rather than any side agreement.

The assumed maturity period for demand loans has been increased from 6 months to 1 year. Any alternate maturity date must be stated in the legal obligation rather than inferred from the documents, in order to form a basis for disclosures.

In multiple-advance transactions, a series of advances up to a certain amount and construction loans that may be permanently financed may be disclosed, at the creditor's option, as either a single transaction or several transactions. Appendix D is applicable only to multiple advances for the construction of a dwelling, whereas its predecessor, Interpretation ยง 226.813, could be used for all multiple-advance transactions.

If disclosures are made before the date of consummation, the creditor need not provide updated disclosures at consummation unless the annual percentage rate has changed beyond certain limits or a variable rate feature has been added.
