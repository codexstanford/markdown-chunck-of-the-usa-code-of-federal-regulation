#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Rules for correction of billing errors and regulation of credit reports.

5.The preemption criteria for the fair credit billing provisions set forth in § 1026.28 have two parts. With respect to the rules on correction of billing errors and regulation of credit reports (which are in § 1026.13), § 1026.28(a)(2)(i) provides that a state law is inconsistent and preempted if its requirements are different from the Federal law. An exception is made, however, for state laws that allow the consumer to inquire about an account and require the creditor to respond to such inquiries beyond the time limits in the Federal law. Such a state law is not preempted with respect to the extra time period. For example, § 1026.13 requires the consumer to submit a written notice of billing error within 60 days after transmittal of the periodic statement showing the alleged error. If a state law allows the consumer 90 days to submit a notice, the state law remains in effect to provide the extra 30 days. Any state law disclosures concerning this extended state time limit must reflect the qualifications and conform to the format specified in § 1026.28(a)(2)(i). Examples of laws that would be preempted include:
