(6)An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its EAD for an OTC derivative contract as provided in ยง 324.132 (c) and (d). An FDIC-supervised institution may take into account the risk-reducing effects of financial collateral in support of a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan and of any collateral in support of a repo-style transaction that is included in the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part through an adjustment to EAD as provided in ยง 324.132(b) and (d). An FDIC-supervised institution that takes collateral into account through such an adjustment to EAD under ยง 324.132 may not reflect such collateral in LGD.
