##### Circumstances for nonpayment.

7.An institution must describe the circumstances under which it will not pay an overdraft. It is sufficient to state, as applicable: "Whether your overdrafts will be paid is discretionary and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing, or you are not making regular deposits, or you have too many overdrafts."
