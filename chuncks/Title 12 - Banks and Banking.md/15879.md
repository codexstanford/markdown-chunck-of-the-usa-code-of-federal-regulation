###### Permanent Schedule.

Under the Federal permanent availability schedule, nonlocal checks must be made available for withdrawal not later than the fifth business day following deposit. The fifth day availability requirement for in-state items in the Wisconsin statute supersedes the Regulation CC time period adjustment for withdrawal by cash or similar means in the permanent schedule, to the extent that the in-state checks are defined as nonlocal under Regulation CC.
