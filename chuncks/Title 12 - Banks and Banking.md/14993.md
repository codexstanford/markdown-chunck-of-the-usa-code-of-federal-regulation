###### Relationship to grace period.

2.Nothing in § 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from assessing interest due to the loss of a grace period to the extent consistent with § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and § 226.54. In addition, a card issuer has not reduced an annual percentage rate on a credit card account for purposes of § 226.55 if the card issuer does not charge interest on a balance or a portion thereof based on a payment received prior to the expiration of a grace period. For example, if the annual percentage rate for purchases on an account is 15% but the card issuer does not charge any interest on a $500 purchase balance because that balance was paid in full prior to the expiration of the grace period, the card issuer has not reduced the 15% purchase rate to 0% for purposes of § 226.55.
