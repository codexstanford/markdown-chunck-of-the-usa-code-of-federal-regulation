## Chapter Xâ€”Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1013 - CONSUMER LEASING (REGULATION M)
#### Supplement I to Part 1013-Official Interpretations
##### Period of time.

2.To be a consumer lease, the initial term of the lease must be more than four months. Thus, a lease of personal property for four months, three months or on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis (even though the lease actually extends beyond four months) is not a consumer lease and is not subject to the disclosure requirements of the regulation. However, a lease that imposes a penalty for not continuing the lease beyond four months is considered to have a term of more than four months. To illustrate:

i. A three-month lease extended on a month-to-month basis and terminated after one year is not subject to the regulation.

ii. A month-to-month lease with a penalty, such as the forfeiture of a security deposit for terminating before one year, is subject to the regulation.
