### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Modification or waiver.,bona fide,bona fide

1.A consumer may modify or waive the right to a waiting period required by § 1026.19(a)(2) only after the creditor makes the disclosures required by § 1026.18. The consumer must have apersonal financial emergency that necessitates consummating the credit transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether these conditions are met is determined by the facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure, where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan proceeds are made available to the consumer during the waiting period, is one example of apersonal financial emergency. Each consumer who is primarily liable on the legal obligation must sign the written statement for the waiver to be effective.
