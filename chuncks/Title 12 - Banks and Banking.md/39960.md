##### Good faith requirement for prepaid interest, property insurance premiums, and escrowed amounts.,See

1.Estimates of prepaid interest, property insurance premiums, and amounts placed into an escrow, impound, reserve or similar account must be consistent with the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are provided. Differences between the amounts of such charges disclosed under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. This means that the estimate disclosed under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) was obtained by the creditor through due diligence, acting in good faith.comments 17(c)(2)(i)-1 and 19(e)(1)(i)-1. For example, if the creditor requires homeowner's insurance but fails to include a homeowner's insurance premium on the estimates provided pursuant to § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor's failure to disclose does not comply with § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii). However, if the creditor does not require flood insurance and the subject property is located in an area where floods frequently occur, but not specifically located in a zone where flood insurance is required, failure to include flood insurance on the original estimates provided pursuant to § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) does not constitute a lack of good faith under § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii). Or, if the creditor knows that the loan must close on the 15th of the month but estimates prepaid interest to be paid from the 30th of that month, then the under-disclosure does not comply with § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii). If, however, the creditor estimates consistent with the best information reasonably available that the loan will close on the 30th of the month and bases the estimate of prepaid interest accordingly, but the loan actually closed on the 1st of the next month instead, the creditor complies with § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).
