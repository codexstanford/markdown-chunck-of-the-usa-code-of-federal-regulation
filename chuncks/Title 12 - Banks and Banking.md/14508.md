#### PART 226-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### 1987 changes:

This section implements section 1204 of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552 which provides that, effective December 9, 1987, adjustable-rate mortgages must include a limitation on the interest rate that may apply during the term of the mortgage loan. An adjustable-rate mortgage loan is defined in section 1204 as "any loan secured by a lien on a one-to-four family dwelling unit, including a condominium unit, cooperative housing unit, or mobile home, where the loan is made pursuant to an agreement under which the creditor may, from time to time, adjust the rate of interest." The rule in this section incorporates section 1204 into Regulation Z and limits the scope of section 1204 to dwelling-secured consumer credit subject to the Truth in Lending Act, in which a creditor has the contractual right to increase the interest rate during the term of the credit obligation.
