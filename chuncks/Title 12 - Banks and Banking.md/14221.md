###### Consummation or settlement.

1.For extensions of credit secured by a consumer's timeshare plan, when corrected disclosures are required, they must be given no later than "consummation or settlement." "Consummation" is defined in ยง 226.2(a). "Settlement" is defined in Regulation X (24 CFR 3500.2(b)) and is subject to any interpretations issued by HUD. In some cases, a creditor may delay redisclosure until settlement, which may be at a time later than consummation. If a creditor chooses to redisclose at settlement, disclosures may be based on the terms in effect at settlement, rather than at consummation. For example, in a variable-rate transaction, a creditor may choose to base disclosures on the terms in effect at settlement, despite the general rule in comment 17(c)(1)-8 that variable-rate disclosures should be based on the terms in effect at consummation.
