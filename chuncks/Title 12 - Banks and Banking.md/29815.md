Section 6.Shares may be issued in a revocable or irrevocable trust, subject to the following:

Shares issued in a revocable trust-the settlor must be a member of this credit union in his or her own right.

Shares issued in an irrevocable trust-either the settlor or the beneficiary must be a member of this credit union.

Both a revocable and irrevocable trust must state the name of the beneficiary. A trust may be a member of the credit union as an entity if all parties to the trust, including all settlors, beneficiaries and trustees, are within the credit union's field of membership.

Shares issued through a pension plan authorized by the rules and regulations will be treated as an irrevocable trust unless otherwise indicated in the rules and regulations.
