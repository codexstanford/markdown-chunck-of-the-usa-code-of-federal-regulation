### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Steering.

1.For purposes of § 1026.36(e), directing or "steering" a consumer to consummate a particular credit transaction means advising, counseling, or otherwise influencing a consumer to accept that transaction. For such actions to constitute steering, the consumer must actually consummate the transaction in question. Thus, § 1026.36(e)(1) does not address the actions of a loan originator if the consumer does not actually obtain a loan through that loan originator.
