###### Permissible changes to rates and terms-re-disclosure not required.

4.Creditors are not required to consummate a loan where the extension of credit would be prohibited by law or where the creditor has reason to believe that the consumer has committed fraud. A creditor may make changes to the rate based on adjustments to the index used for the loan and changes that will unequivocally benefit the consumer. For example, a creditor is permitted to reduce the interest rate or lower the amount of a fee. A creditor may also reduce the loan amount based on a certification or other information received from a covered educational institution or from the consumer indicating that the student's cost of attendance has decreased or the amount of other financial aid has increased. A creditor may also withdraw the loan approval based on a certification or other information received from a covered educational institution or from the consumer indicating that the student is not enrolled in the institution. For these changes permitted by ยง 226.48(c)(3), the creditor is not required to provide a new set of approval disclosures required under ยง 226.47(b) or provide the consumer with a new 30-day acceptance period under ยง 226.48(c)(1). The creditor must provide the final disclosures under ยง 226.47(c).
