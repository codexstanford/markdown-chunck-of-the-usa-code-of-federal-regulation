1.For guidance on disclosing the location of a property for which an address is unavailable, see the commentary to § 1026.37(a)(6). Where personal property also secures the credit transaction, a description of that property may be disclosed, at the creditor's option, pursuant to § 1026.38(a)(3)(vi). If the form does not provide enough space to disclose a description of personal property under § 1026.38(a)(3)(vi), at the creditor's option an additional page may be used and appended to the end of the form provided that the creditor complies with the requirements of § 1026.38(t)(3).
