## Chapter II - Federal Reserve System
### Subchapter A - Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
#### PART 226-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### 1981 changes:

This section retains the advertising rules in a form very similar to the previous regulation, but with certain changes to reflect the 1980 statutory amendments. For example, if triggering terms appear in any advertisement, the additional disclosures required no longer include the cash price. The special rule for FHA section 235 financing has been eliminated, as well as the rule for advertising credit payable in more than four installments with no identified finance charge. Interpretation ยง 226.1002, requiring disclosure of representative amounts of credit in catalogs and multiple-page advertisements, has been incorporated in simplified form in ยง 226.24(d).

Unlike the previous regulation, if the advertised annual percentage rate is subject to increase, that fact must now be disclosed.
