For example, a credit card issuer begins offering an agreement in October and submits the agreement to the Bureau the following January 31, as required by § 1026.58(c)(1). As of March 31, the card issuer has not amended the agreement and is still offering the agreement to the public. The card issuer is not required to submit anything to the Bureau regarding that agreement by April 30.
