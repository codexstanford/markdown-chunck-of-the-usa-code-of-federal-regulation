3.Certain cards, codes, or other devices may be redeemable upon presentation for a specific good or service, or "experience," such as a spa treatment, hotel stay, or airline flight. In other cases, a card, code, or other device may entitle the consumer to a certain percentage off the purchase of a good or service, such as 20% off of any purchase in a store. Such cards, codes, or other devices generally are not subject to the requirements of this section because they are not issued to a consumer "in a specified amount" as required under the definitions of "gift certificate," "store gift card," or "general-use prepaid card." However, if the card, code, or other device is issued in a specified or denominated amount that can be applied toward the purchase of a specific good or service, such as a certificate or card redeemable for a spa treatment up to $50, the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless one of the exceptions in ยง 205.20(b) apply.ยง 205.20(b)(3). Similarly, if the card, code, or other device states a specific monetary value, such as "a $50 value," the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless an exclusion in ยง 205.20(b) applies.
