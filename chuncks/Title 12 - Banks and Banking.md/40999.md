#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Adjustments.

6.Section 1026.38(j)(2)(vi) requires the disclosure of any additional amounts not already disclosed under § 1026.38(f), (g), (h), and (j)(2), that are owed to the consumer but payable to the seller before the real estate closing. The disclosures made under § 1026.38(j)(2)(vi) must also include a description for each disclosed amount. For example, rent paid to the seller from a tenant before the real estate closing for a period extending beyond the real estate closing is disclosed by identifying the amount as rent from a tenant under the heading "Adjustments." See also § 1026.38(k)(2)(viii), which requires disclosure of a description and amount of any and all other obligations required to be paid by the seller at the real estate closing.
