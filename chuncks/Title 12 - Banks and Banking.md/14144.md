###### Purchase money transactions.

1.When the collateral is the item purchased as part of, or with the proceeds of, the credit transaction, section 226.18(m) requires only a general identification such as "the property purchased in this transaction." However, the creditor may identify the property by item or type instead of identifying it more generally with a phrase such as "the property purchased in this transaction." For example, a creditor may identify collateral as "a motor vehicle," or as "the property purchased in this transaction." Any transaction in which the credit is being used to purchase the collateral is considered a purchase money transaction and the abbreviated identification may be used, whether the obligation is treated as a loan or a credit sale.
