##### Requirements.

1.A creditor or other person may impose a fee before the consumer receives the required disclosures if the fee is for purchasing a credit report on the consumer. The fee also must be bona fide and reasonable in amount. For example, a creditor or other person may collect a fee for obtaining a credit report if it is in the creditor's or other person's ordinary course of business to obtain a credit report. If the criteria in § 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(B) are met, the creditor or other person must accurately describe or refer to this fee, for example, as a "credit report fee."
