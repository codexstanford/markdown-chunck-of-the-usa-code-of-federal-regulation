(3) With respect to funds transfers sent through the FedNow Service, if originators and beneficiaries that are not in privity with a Federal Reserve Bank have the notice contemplated by Section 4A-507(c) or if those parties agree to be bound by subpart C of this part, subpart C of this part generally would apply to those remote parties. If remote parties to a funds transfer, a portion of which is sent through the FedNow Service, have expressly selected by agreement a law other than subpart C of this part under section 4A-507(b), subpart C of this part would not take precedence over the choice of law made by the agreement even though the remote parties had notice that the FedNow Service may be used and of the governing law. (4A-507(d).) In addition, subpart C of this part would not apply to a funds transfer sent through a funds-transfer system other than the FedNow Service, even though settlement for the funds transfer is made by means of a separate funds transfer through the FedNow Service.
