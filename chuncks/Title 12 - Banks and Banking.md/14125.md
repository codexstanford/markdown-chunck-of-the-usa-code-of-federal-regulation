###### Combined payment schedule disclosures.

2.Creditors may combine the option in this paragraph with the general payment schedule requirements in transactions where only a portion of the payment schedule meets the conditions of ยง 226.18(g)(2). For example, in a graduated payment mortgage where payments rise sharply for 5 years and then decline over the next 25 years because of decreasing mortgage insurance premiums, the first 5 years would be disclosed under the general rule in ยง 226.18(g) and the next 25 years according to the abbreviated schedule in ยง 226.18(g)(2).
