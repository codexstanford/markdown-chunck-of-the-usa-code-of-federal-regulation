###### ยง 615.5351 Standards for determination of appropriate individual institution minimum capital ratios.

The appropriate minimum capital ratios for an individual institution cannot be determined solely through the application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective criteria. The decision is necessarily based in part on subjective judgment grounded in Agency expertise. The factors to be considered in the determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:

(a) The conditions or circumstances leading to the Farm Credit Administration's determination that higher minimum capital ratios are appropriate or necessary for the institution;

(b) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;

(c) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects of the institution and, if applicable, affiliated institutions;

(d) The institution's capital, adverse assets (including nonaccrual and nonperforming loans), allowance for credit loss, and other ratios compared to the ratios of its peers or industry norms; and

(e) The views of the institution's directors and senior management.
