##### Combined disclosures.

1.If a single disclosure is used to comply with both §§ 1026.9(e) and 1026.7, the periodic statement must comply with the rules in §§ 1026.60 and 1026.7. For example, a description substantially similar to the heading describing the grace period required by § 1026.60(b)(5) must be used and the name of the balance-calculation method must be identified (if listed in § 1026.60(g)) to comply with the requirements of § 1026.60. A card issuer may include some of the renewal disclosures on a periodic statement and others on a separate document so long as there is some reference indicating that the disclosures relate to one another. All renewal disclosures must be provided to a cardholder at the same time.
