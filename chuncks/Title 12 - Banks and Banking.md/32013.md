###### Grandfathering of NCUA-approved state rules.

(b)A state supervisory authority that administers a state commercial and member business loan rule previously approved by NCUA may continue to administer that rule in its current NCUA-approved format. Any modification of that rule must be consistent with this rule, but modification of one part of an existing NCUA-approved state rule will not cause other parts of that rule to lose their grandfathered status.
