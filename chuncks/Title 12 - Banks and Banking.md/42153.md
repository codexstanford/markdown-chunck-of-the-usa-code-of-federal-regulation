i. The card issuer structures the credit card account as a "charge card account" (where no periodic rate is used to compute a finance charge on the credit card account) if the credit feature is linked to the prepaid card as described in § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D)(), but applies a periodic rate to compute a finance charge on the consumer's account (and thus does not use a charge card account structure) if there is no such link. See § 1026.2(a)(15)(iii) for the definition of "charge card."
