## Chapter I - Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury
### PART 5 - RULES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES FOR CORPORATE ACTIVITIES
#### Subpart A - Rules of General Applicability
##### ยง 5.13 Decisions.
###### e.g.,

(ii) Adverse comments that the OCC determines do not raise a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern or a significant legal or policy issue; are frivolous, non-substantive, or filed primarily as a means of delaying action on the filing; or raise a CRA concern that has been satisfactorily resolved do not affect the OCC's decision under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The OCC considers a comment to be non-substantive if it is a generalized opinion that a filing should or should not be approved or a conclusory statement, lacking factual or analytical support. The OCC considers a CRA concern to have been satisfactorily resolved if the OCC previously reviewed (in an examination, other supervisory activity, or a prior filing made by the current filer) a concern presenting substantially the same issue in substantially the same assessment area during substantially the same time, and the OCC determines that the concern would not warrant denial or imposition of a condition on approval of the application.

(iii) If a bank or savings association makes a filing for any activity or transaction that is dependent upon the approval of another filing under this part, or if requests for approval for more than one activity or transaction are combined in a single filing under applicable sections of this part, none of the subject filings may be deemed approved upon expiration of the applicable time periods, unless all of the filings are subject to expedited review procedures and the longest of the time periods expires without the OCC issuing a decision or notifying the bank or savings association that the filings are not eligible for expedited review under the standards in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
