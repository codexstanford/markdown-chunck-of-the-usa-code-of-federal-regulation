#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### General prohibition on disclosure of third-party fees in the short form.

1.Section 1005.18(b)(3)(iv) states that a financial institution may not include any third-party fees in a disclosure made pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2), except for, as provided by § 1005.18(b)(3)(v), the cash reload fee required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv). Fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv). For example, if a program manager performs customer service functions for a financial institution's prepaid account program, and charges a fee for live agent customer service, that fee must be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv).
