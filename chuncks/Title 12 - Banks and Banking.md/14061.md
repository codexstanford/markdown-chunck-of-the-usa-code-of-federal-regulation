2.When two consumers are joint obligors with primary liability on an obligation, the disclosures may be given to either one of them. If one consumer is merely a surety or guarantor, the disclosures must be given to the principal debtor. In rescindable transactions, however, separate disclosures must be given to each consumer who has the right to rescind under ยง 226.23, although the disclosures required under ยง 226.19(b) need only be provided to the consumer who expresses an interest in a variable-rate loan program.
