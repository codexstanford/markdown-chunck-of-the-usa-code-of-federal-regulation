##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Renewal.

1.This exception applies both to obligations with a single payment of principal and interest and to obligations with periodic payments of interest and a final payment of principal. In determining whether a new obligation replacing an old one is a renewal of the original terms or a refinancing, the creditor may consider it a renewal even if:

- Accrued unpaid interest is added to the principal balance.

- Changes are made in the terms of renewal resulting from the factors listed in ยง 226.17(c)(3).

- The principal at renewal is reduced by a curtailment of the obligation.
