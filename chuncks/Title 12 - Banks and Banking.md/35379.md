#### Appendix A to Part 1008 - Examples of Mortgage Loan Originator Activities
##### Taking a Loan Application.

(a)Taking a residential mortgage loan application within the meaning of § 1008.103(c)(1) means receipt by an individual, for the purpose of facilitating a decision whether to extend an offer of loan terms to a borrower or prospective borrower, of an application as defined in § 1008.23 (a request in any form for an offer, or a response to a solicitation of an offer, of residential mortgage loan terms, and the information about the borrower or prospective borrower that is customary or necessary in a decision whether to make such an offer).

(1) The following are examples to illustrate when an individual takes, or does not take, a loan application:

(i) An individual "takes a residential mortgage loan application" even if the individual:

(A) Has received the borrower or prospective borrower's request or information indirectly. Section 1008.103(c)(1) provides that an individual takes an application, whether he or she receives it "directly or indirectly" from the borrower or prospective borrower. This means that an individual who offers or negotiates residential mortgage loan terms for compensation or gain cannot avoid licensing requirements simply by having another person physically receive the application from the prospective borrower and then pass the application to the individual;

(B) Is not responsible for verifying information. The fact that an individual who takes application information from a borrower or prospective borrower is not responsible for verifying that information-for example, the individual is a mortgage broker who collects and sends that information to a lender-does not mean that the individual is not taking an application;

(C) Only inputs the information into an online application or other automated system; or

(D) Is not involved in approval of the loan, including determining whether the consumer qualifies for the loan. Similar to an individual who is not responsible for verification, an individual can still "take a residential mortgage loan application" even if he or she is not ultimately responsible for approving the loan. A mortgage broker, for example, can take a residential mortgage loan application even though it is passed on to a lender for a decision on whether the borrower qualifies for the loan and for the ultimate loan approval.

(ii) An individual does not take a loan application merely because the individual performs any of the following actions:

(A) Receives a loan application through the mail and forwards it, without review, to loan approval personnel. The Bureau interprets the term "takes a residential mortgage loan application" to exclude an individual whose only role with respect to the application is physically handling a completed application form or transmitting a completed form to a lender on behalf of a borrower or prospective borrower. This interpretation is consistent with the definition of "loan originator" in section 1503(3) of the S.A.F.E. Act.

(B) Assists a borrower or prospective borrower who is filling out an application by explaining the contents of the application and where particular borrower information is to be provided on the application;

(C) Generally describes for a borrower or prospective borrower the loan application process without a discussion of particular loan products; or

(D) In response to an inquiry regarding a prequalified offer that a borrower or prospective borrower has received from a lender, collects only basic identifying information about the borrower or prospective borrower on behalf of that lender.
