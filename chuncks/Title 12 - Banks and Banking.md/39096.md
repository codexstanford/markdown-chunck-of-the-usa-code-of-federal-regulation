#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Legal obligation.

1.The disclosures should reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound at the time of giving the disclosures.

i. The legal obligation is determined by applicable state or other law.

ii. The fact that a term or contract may later be deemed unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or other grounds does not, by itself, mean that disclosures based on that term or contract did not reflect the legal obligation.

iii. The legal obligation normally is presumed to be contained in the contract that evidences the agreement. But this may be rebutted if another agreement between the parties legally modifies that contract.
