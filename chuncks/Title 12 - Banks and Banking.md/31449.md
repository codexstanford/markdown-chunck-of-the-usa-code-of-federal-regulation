###### "Free" or "no cost" accounts.

3.For purposes of determining whether an account can be advertised as "free" or "no cost," maintenance and activity fees include:

i. Any fee imposed if a minimum balance requirement is not met, or if the member exceeds a specified number of transactions.

ii. Transaction and service fees that members reasonably expect to be imposed on an account on a regular basis (see comments 4(b)(4)-1 and 2).

iii. A flat fee, such as a monthly service fee.

iv. Fees imposed to deposit, withdraw or transfer funds, including per-check or per-transaction charges (for example, $.25 for each withdrawal, whether by check, in person).
