#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Informal periods affecting late payments.

1.Although the terms of the account agreement may provide that a card issuer may assess a late payment fee if a payment is not received by a certain date, the card issuer may have an informal policy or practice that delays the assessment of the late payment fee for payments received a brief period of time after the date upon which a card issuer has the contractual right to impose the fee. A card issuer must disclose the due date according to the legal obligation between the parties, and need not consider the end of an informal "courtesy period" as the due date under § 1026.7(b)(11).
