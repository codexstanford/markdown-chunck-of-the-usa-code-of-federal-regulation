1.Credit unions must include a statement as to when dividends begin to accrue for noncash deposits. Credit unions may disclose additional information such as the time of day after which deposits are treated as having been received the following business day, and may use additional descriptive terms such as "ledger" or "collected" balances to disclose when dividends begin to accrue. Under the ledger balance method, dividends begin to accrue on the day of deposit. Under the collected balance methods, dividends begin to accrue when provisional credit is received for the item deposited.
