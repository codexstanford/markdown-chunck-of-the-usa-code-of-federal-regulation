ii. A financial institution using the multiple service plan short form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)() charges $1 under each of its service plans for both in-network and out-of-network automated teller machine withdrawals in the United States. The financial institution may disclose the ATM withdrawal fee on one line, instead of two, using the general heading "ATM withdrawal" required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii); in that case, it need not disclose the terms "in-network" or "out-of-network."
