2.The dollar amounts disclosed under § 1026.38 generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required.comment 38(t)(4)-1. Any amount in the "Final" column of the calculating cash to close table under § 1026.38(i) is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Under § 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any amount in the "Loan Estimate" column of the calculating cash to close table under § 1026.38(i) is rounded to the nearest dollar amount to match the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate's calculating cash to close table under § 1026.37(h). For purposes of § 1026.38(i)(1)(iii), (3)(iii), (4)(iii), (5)(iii), (6)(iii), (7)(iii), and (8)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, non-rounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under § 1026.37(h) if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the amount in the "Loan Estimate" column of the total closing costs row disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(1)(i) is $12,500, but the non-rounded estimate of total closing costs is $12,500.35, and the amount in the "Final" column of the total closing costs row disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(1)(ii) is $12,500.35, then, even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in total closing costs, no statement of such increase is given under § 1026.38(i)(1)(iii).
