### Subchapter A - Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
#### PART 223-TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MEMBER BANKS AND THEIR AFFILIATES (REGULATION W)
##### Subpart H-Miscellaneous Interpretations
###### ยง 223.71 How do sections 23A and 23B apply to transactions in which a member bank purchases from one affiliate an asset relating to another affiliate?
####### Examples,The (d)(6) exemption.

(b)-(1)A member bank purchases from Affiliate A securities issued by Affiliate B in a purchase that qualifies for the (d)(6) exemption in section 23A. The member bank's asset purchase from Affiliate A would be an exempt covered transaction under ยง 223.42(e); but the member bank also would have acquired an investment in securities issued by Affiliate B, which would be a covered transaction between the member bank and Affiliate B under ยง 223.3(h)(2) that does not qualify for the (d)(6) exemption. The (d)(6) exemption, by its terms, only exempts asset purchases by a member bank from an affiliate; hence, the (d)(6) exemption cannot exempt a member bank's investment in securities issued by an affiliate (even if the securities would qualify for the (d)(6) exemption).
