(1) If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer.

(2) If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line.

(3) If the automated teller machine where you are making the transfer does not have enough cash.

(4) If the [terminal] [system] was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.

(5) If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.

(6) There may be other exceptions stated in our agreement with you.
