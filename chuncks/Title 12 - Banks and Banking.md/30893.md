###### Weighted average asset life.

(f)The weighted average life (WAL) of a corporate credit union's financial assets, consisting of cash, investments, and loans, but excluding derivative contracts and equity investments, may not exceed 2 years. A corporate credit union must test its financial assets at least quarterly, including once on the last day of the calendar quarter, for compliance with this WAL limitation. When calculating its WAL, a corporate credit union must assume that no issuer or market options will be exercised. If the WAL of a corporate credit union's assets exceeds 2 years on the testing date, this test must be calculated at least monthly, including once on the last day of the month, until the WAL is below 2 years.
