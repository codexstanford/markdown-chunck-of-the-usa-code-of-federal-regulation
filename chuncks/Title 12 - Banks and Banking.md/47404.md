####### General.

(a)FHFA will determine whether an activity included in an Enterprise's Underserved Markets Plan will receive duty to serve credit or extra credit under an underserved market in the Plan. In this determination, FHFA will consider whether the activity facilitates a secondary market for financing mortgages: On manufactured homes for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families; to preserve housing affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income families; and on housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families in rural areas. If FHFA determines that an activity will receive duty to serve credit or extra credit under an underserved market in the Plan, the activity will receive such credit under the relevant evaluation area for each underserved market it serves.
