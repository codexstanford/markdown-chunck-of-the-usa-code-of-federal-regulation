2.The right to reject the plan referenced in this paragraph is the same as the right to reject the plan described in § 226.5(b)(1)(iv). If an issuer substitutes the account-opening summary table described in § 226.6(b)(1) in lieu of the disclosures specified in § 226.5a(d)(2)(ii), the disclosure specified in § 226.5a(d)(2)(ii)(B) must appear in the table, if the issuer is required to do so pursuant to § 226.6(b)(2)(xiii). Otherwise, the disclosure specified in § 226.5a(d)(2)(ii)(B) may appear either in or outside the table containing the required credit disclosures.
