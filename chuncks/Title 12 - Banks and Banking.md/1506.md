##### ยง 5.23 Conversion to become a Federal savings association.
###### Continuation of business and entity.

(g)The existence of the converting institution continues in the resulting Federal savings association. The resulting Federal savings association is considered the same business and entity as the converting institution, although as to rights, powers, and duties, the resulting Federal savings association is a Federal savings association. Any and all of the assets and other property (whether real, personal, mixed, tangible or intangible, including choses in action, rights, and credits) of the converting institution become assets and property of the resulting Federal savings association when the conversion occurs. Similarly, any and all of the obligations and debts of and claims against the converting institution become obligations and debts of and claims against the Federal savings association when the conversion occurs.
