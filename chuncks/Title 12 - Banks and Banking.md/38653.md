### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Subpart G-Special Rules Applicable to Credit Card Accounts and Open-End Credit Offered to College Students
##### § 1026.61 Hybrid prepaid-credit cards.
###### Non-covered separate credit feature.

(ii)A separate credit feature that does not meet the two conditions set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is defined as a non-covered separate credit feature. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature, even if the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it may be subject to this regulation depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.
