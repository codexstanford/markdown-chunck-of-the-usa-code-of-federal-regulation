####### Additional considerations.

(b)(1) In reviewing the notice and other materials submitted under this subpart, the FDIC will take into account the extent to which the proposed conversion transaction conforms with the various provisions of the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (12 CFR part 563b), as currently in effect at the time the notice is submitted. Any non-conformity with those provisions will be closely reviewed.

(2) Conformity with the OTS requirements will not be sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes if the FDIC determines that the proposed conversion transaction would pose a risk to the bank's safety or soundness, violate any law or regulation, or present a breach of fiduciary duty.
