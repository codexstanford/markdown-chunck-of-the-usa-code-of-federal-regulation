#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### In general.

1.Section 1026.18(s) prescribes format and content for disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments for reverse mortgages and certain transactions secured by dwellings that are personal property but not cooperative units. The information in § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) is required to be in the form of a table, except as otherwise provided, with headings and format substantially similar to model clause H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H) in appendix H to this part. A disclosure that does not include the shading shown in a model clause but otherwise follows the model clause's headings and format is substantially similar to that model clause. Where § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) or the applicable model clause requires that a column or row of the table be labeled using the word "monthly" but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the appropriate term, such as "bi-weekly" or "quarterly." In all cases, the table should have no more than five vertical columns corresponding to applicable interest rates at various times during the loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in horizontal rows. Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes of § 1026.18(s) in § 1026.18(s)(7).
