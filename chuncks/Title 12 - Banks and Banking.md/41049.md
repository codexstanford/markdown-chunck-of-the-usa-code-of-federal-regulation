#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Name of person.,e.g.,

2.Where § 1026.38(r)(1) calls for disclosure of the name of the person participating in the transaction, the person's legal name (the name used for registration, incorporation, or chartering purposes), the person's trade name, if any, or an abbreviation of the person's legal name or the trade name is disclosed, so long as the disclosure is clear and conspicuous as required by § 1026.38(t)(1)(i). For example, if the creditor's legal name is "Alpha Beta Chi Bank and Trust Company, N.A." and its trade name is "ABC Bank," then under § 1026.38(r)(1) the full legal name, the trade name, or an abbreviation such as "ABC Bank & Trust Co." may be disclosed. However, the abbreviation "Bank & Trust Co." is not sufficiently distinct to enable a consumer to identify the person, and therefore would not be clear and conspicuous. If the creditor, mortgage broker, seller's real estate broker, consumer's real estate broker, or settlement agent participating in the transaction is a natural person, the natural person's name is listed in the § 1026.38(r)(1) and (r)(4) disclosures (assuming that such natural person is the primary contact for the consumer or seller, as applicable).
