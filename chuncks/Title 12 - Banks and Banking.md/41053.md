##### Contact.

6.Section 1026.38(r)(4) requires the disclosure of the primary contact for the consumer. The primary contact is the natural person employed by the person disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(1) who interacts most frequently with the consumer and who has an NMLSR ID or, if none, a license number or other unique identifier to be disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(5), as applicable. For example, if the senior loan officer employed by the creditor or mortgage broker disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(1) has an NMLSR ID, but the consumer meets with a different loan officer to complete the application and answer questions, the senior loan officer's name is disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(4) unless the other loan officer also has an NMLSR ID, in which case the other loan officer's name is disclosed. Further, if the sales agent employed by the consumer's real estate broker disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(1) has a State-issued brokers' license number, but the consumer meets with an associate sales agent to tour the property being purchased and complete the sales contract, the sales agent's name is disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(4) unless the associate sales agent also has a State-issued license number, in which case the associate sales agent's name is disclosed. Moreover, if the closing attorney employed by the settlement agent disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(1) has a State-issued settlement agent license number, but the consumer meets with the attorney's assistant to fill out any necessary documentation prior to the closing and to answer questions, the closing attorney's name is disclosed under § 1026.38(r)(4) because the assistant is only performing clerical functions.
