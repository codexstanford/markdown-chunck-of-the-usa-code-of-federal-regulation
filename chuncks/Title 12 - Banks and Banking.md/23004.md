####### SA-CCR.

(g)An advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution may use CEM rather than SA-CCR for purposes of §§ 324.34(a) and 324.132(c) until January 1, 2022. A FDIC-supervised institution must provide prior notice to the FDIC if it decides to begin using SA-CCR before January 1, 2022. On January 1, 2022, and thereafter, an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution must use SA-CCR for purposes of §§ 324.34(a), 324.132(c), and 324.133(d). Once an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution has begun to use SA-CCR, the advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution may not change to use CEM.
