###### ยง 617.7410 When and how does a qualified lender notify a borrower of the right to seek loan restructuring?
####### When is a qualified lender required to send another restructure notice to a borrower whose loan was previously restructured?

(e)A qualified lender must notify a borrower of the right to file another application to restructure the loan if the qualified lender sent the nonforeclosure notice to the borrower and the borrower has performed on the previous restructure agreement. Performance means that a borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments, four consecutive quarterly payments, three consecutive semiannual payments, or two consecutive annual payments. However, a qualified lender is not required to send another notice if they previously sent a 45-day notice, as described in ยง 617.7410(a)(2), and a borrower did not perform under a restructure agreement, as described above.
