(i) Each Adhering Party will access the "Protocols" section of the ISDA website atto enter information online that is required to generate its form of Adherence Letter and will submit payment of any applicable fee. Either by directly downloading the populated Adherence Letter from the Protocol system or upon receipt via email of the populated Adherence Letter, each Adhering Party will sign and upload the signed Adherence Letter as a PDF (portable document format) attachment into the Protocol system. Once the signed Adherence Letter has been approved and accepted by ISDA, such Adhering Party will receive an email confirmation of the Adhering Party's adherence to this Protocol.

(ii) A conformed copy of each Adherence Letter containing, in place of each signature, the printed or typewritten name of each signatory will be published by ISDA so that it may be viewed by all Adhering Parties. Each Adhering Party agrees that, for evidentiary purposes, a conformed copy of an Adherence Letter certified by the General Counsel (or other appropriate officer) of ISDA will be deemed to be an original.

(iii) Each Adhering Party agrees that the determination of the date and time of acceptance of any Adherence Letter will be determined by ISDA in its absolute discretion. Any Adherence Letter which is dated and delivered to ISDA before the date on which this Protocol is published will be deemed to have been delivered on the date on which this Protocol is published.

(c) As between two Adhering Parties, the agreement to make the amendments contemplated by this Protocol, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Protocol, will be effective on the Implementation Date and that agreement will form part of each Protocol Covered Document from the later of the Implementation Date and the related Protocol Covered Document Date. The amendments contemplated by this Protocol shall be made on the later of (i) the Implementation Date and (ii) the Protocol Effective Date.

(A) The Protocol Effective Date with respect to a Protocol Covered Document shall be January 25, 2021.

(B) The Implementation Date with respect to any two Adhering Parties shall be the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of such two Adhering Parties to adhere except that:

(I) In respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which an Agent has entered on behalf of a Client, subject to paragraph 3(m) below, the Implementation Date shall be the date specified in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(A), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C), paragraph 3(h), paragraph 3(i) or paragraph 3(j) below, as applicable; and

(II) In respect of any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document, subject to paragraph 3(m) below, the Implementation Date shall be the day specified in paragraph 3(l) below.

Acceptance by ISDA of a subsequent or revised Adherence Letter from either such Adhering Party will not have the effect of changing such Implementation Date.

(d) This Protocol is intended for use without negotiation, but without prejudice to any amendment, modification or waiver in respect of a Protocol Covered Document that the parties may otherwise effect in accordance with the terms of that Protocol Covered Document.

(i) In adhering to this Protocol, an Adhering Party may not specify additional provisions, conditions or limitations in its Adherence Letter.

(ii) Any purported adherence that ISDA, as agent, determines in good faith is not in compliance with this Protocol will be void and ISDA will inform the relevant party of such fact as soon as reasonably possible after making such determination.

(e) Each Adhering Party acknowledges and agrees that adherence to this Protocol is irrevocable, except that an Adhering Party may, after the Protocol Effective Date, deliver to ISDA, as agent, a notice substantially in the form of Exhibit 2 to this Protocol that is effective (determined pursuant to paragraph 3(f) below) on any Protocol Business Day (a Revocation Notice) to designate the next Revocation Date as the last date on which an Implementation Date can occur in respect of any Protocol Covered Document between the counterparty and such Adhering Party. Following the effective delivery of a Revocation Notice by an Adhering Party, this Protocol will not amend any Protocol Covered Document between that Adhering Party and another Adhering Party for which the Implementation Date would occur after the related Revocation Date.

(i) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol on behalf of a Client, then, if the Client effectively delivers a Revocation Notice in accordance with this paragraph 1(e), this Protocol will not amend any Protocol Covered Document between another Adhering Party and that Client entered into by that Client itself or by the Agent on behalf of that Client or any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document (if applicable), in each case, for which the Implementation Date would occur after the Revocation Date designated as the last date on which an Implementation Date can occur in the Client's Revocation Notice.

(ii) If an Agent delivers a Revocation Notice in accordance with this paragraph 1(e) on behalf of a Client and the Client separately adheres to this Protocol directly rather than through the agency of an Agent, then the Revocation Notice delivered by the Agent will not prevent an Implementation Date from occurring after the Revocation Date in respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which the Client has entered with another Adhering Party (including through the Agent).

(iii) Subparagraph 1(e)(i), subparagraph 1(e)(ii) and subparagraph 1(e)(iii) are without prejudice to any amendment effected pursuant to this Protocol to any Protocol Covered Document between two Adhering Parties for which the Implementation Date occurred on or before the day on which that Revocation Date occurs or is deemed to occur, regardless of the date on which such Protocol Covered Document is entered into, and any such amendment shall be effective notwithstanding the occurrence or deemed occurrence of such Revocation Date.

(iv) Each Revocation Notice must be delivered by the means specified in paragraph 3(f) below.

(v) Each Adhering Party agrees that, for evidentiary purposes, a conformed copy of a Revocation Notice certified by the General Counsel or an appropriate officer of ISDA will be deemed to be an original.

(vi) Any purported revocation that ISDA, as agent, determines in good faith is not in compliance with this paragraph 1(e) will be void and ISDA will inform the relevant party of such fact as soon as reasonably possible after making such determination.

(a) As of the later of (i) the date on which an Adhering Party adheres to this Protocol in accordance with paragraph 1 above (which will be the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter from that Adhering Party (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above)) and (ii) the Protocol Covered Document Date, such Adhering Party represents to each other Adhering Party with which it has entered into a Protocol Covered Document (which representations will be deemed to be repeated on the Protocol Effective Date and the Implementation Date if one or both such dates are later than the date on which such Adhering Party adheres to this Protocol) each of the following matters:
