##### Nonrecourse transaction.

1.A nonrecourse reverse mortgage transaction limits the homeowner's liability to the proceeds of the sale of the home (or any lesser amount specified in the credit obligation). If a transaction structured as a closed-end reverse mortgage transaction allows recourse against the consumer, and the annual percentage rate or the points and fees exceed those specified under § 1026.32(a)(1), the transaction is subject to all the requirements of § 1026.32, including the limitations concerning balloon payments and negative amortization.
