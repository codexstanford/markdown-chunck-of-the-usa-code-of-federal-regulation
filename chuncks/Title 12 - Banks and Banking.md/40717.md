#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Whole years.

1.For adjustments that occur after a period of whole years, the timing of information required by § 1026.37(b)(8) starts with year number "1," counting from the date that interest for the first scheduled periodic payment begins to accrue for § 1026.37(b)(8)(i), or from the due date of the first periodic payment for § 1026.37(b)(8)(ii), or from the date of consummation for § 1026.37(b)(8)(iii). For example, an interest rate that is fixed for five years and can first adjust at the beginning of the 61st month from the date that interest for the regularly scheduled periodic payment began to accrue would be disclosed as beginning to adjust in "year 6." A monthly periodic payment that adjusts starting with the 61st scheduled payment likewise would be disclosed as adjusting in "year 6."
