##### Relation to other sections.

2.For disclosures made before the mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under §§ 1026.46, 47, and 48, paragraph 17(i) permitted creditors to omit from the disclosures the terms set forth in that paragraph at the time the credit was actually extended. However, creditors were required to make complete disclosures at the time the creditor and consumer agreed upon the repayment schedule for the total obligation. At that time, a new set of disclosures of all applicable items under § 1026.18 was required. Most student credit plans are subject to the requirements in §§ 1026.46, 47, and 48. Consequently, for applications for student credit plans received on or after the mandatory compliance date of §§ 1026.46, 47, and 48, the creditor may not omit from the disclosures the terms set forth in paragraph 17(i). Instead, the creditor must comply with §§ 1026.46, 47, and 48, if applicable, or with §§ 1026.17 and 1026.18.
