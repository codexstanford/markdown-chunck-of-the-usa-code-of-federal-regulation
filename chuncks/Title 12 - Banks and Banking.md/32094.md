(A)A newly chartered federally insured credit union that obtains federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year shall not receive an NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year unless the federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board has declared a distribution. For purposes of calculating the newly chartered federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, the federally insured credit union shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods preceding the first reporting period in which the federally insured credit union files its first quarterly Call Report.
