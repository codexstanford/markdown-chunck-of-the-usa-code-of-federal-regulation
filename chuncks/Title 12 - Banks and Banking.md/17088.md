####### Offering restrictions.

(c)(1) No representations may be made in any manner in connection with the offer or sale of any stock issued pursuant to this section that the price, price range or any other pricing information related to such stock issuance has been approved by the Board or that the stock has been approved or disapproved by the Board or that the Board has endorsed the accuracy or adequacy of any securities offering documents disseminated in connection with such stock.

(2) The sale of minority stock of the subsidiary holding company to be made under the minority stock issuance plan, including any sale in a public offering or direct community marketing, shall be completed as promptly as possible and within 45 calendar days after the last day of the subscription period, unless extended by the Board.

(3) In the offer, sale, or purchase of stock issued pursuant to this section, no person shall:

(i) Employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;

(ii) Make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or

(iii) Engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser or seller.

(4) Prior to the completion of a stock issuance pursuant to this section, no person shall transfer, or enter into any agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial ownership of the stock to be issued to any other person.

(5) Prior to the completion of a stock issuance pursuant to this section, no person shall make any offer, or any announcement of any offer, to purchase any stock to be issued, or knowingly acquire any stock in the issuance, in excess of the maximum purchase limitations established in the Stock Issuance Plan.

(6) All stock issuances pursuant to this section must:

(i) Comply with § 239.59 and, to the extent applicable, the form or forms specified by the Board; and

(ii) Provide that the offering be structured in a manner similar to a standard conversion under subpart E of this part, including the stock purchase priorities accorded members of the issuing subsidiary holding company's mutual holding company, unless the subsidiary holding company would qualify for a supervisory conversion if it were to undertake a conversion under subpart E of this part; or demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board that a non-conforming issuance would be more beneficial to the savings association and subsidiary holding company compared to a conforming offering, considering, in the aggregate, the effect of each on the savings association and subsidiary holding company's financial and managerial resources and future prospects, the effect of the issuance upon the savings association and subsidiary holding company, the insurance risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served.

(7) Notwithstanding the restrictions in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, a subsidiary holding company of a mutual holding company may issue stock as part of a stock benefit plan to any insider, associate of an insider, or tax qualified or non-tax qualified employee stock benefit plan of the mutual holding company or subsidiary of the mutual holding company without including the purchase priorities of subpart E of this part.

(8) As part of a reorganization, a reasonable amount of shares or proceeds may be contributed to a charitable organization that complies with §§ 239.64(b) to 239.64(f), provided such contribution does not result in any taxes on excess business holdings under section 4943 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 4943).
