### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### In the borrower's interest.

1.The determination of whether or not a refinancing covered by § 1026.34(a)(3) is in the borrower's interest is based on the totality of the circumstances, at the time the credit is extended. A written statement by the borrower that "this loan is in my interest" alone does not meet this standard.

i. A refinancing would be in the borrower's interest if needed to meet the borrower's "bona fide personal financial emergency" (see generally § 1026.23(e) and § 1026.31(c)(1)(iii)).

ii. In connection with a refinancing that provides additional funds to the borrower, in determining whether a loan is in the borrower's interest consideration should be given to whether the loan fees and charges are commensurate with the amount of new funds advanced, and whether the real estate-related charges are bona fide and reasonable in amount (see generally § 1026.4(c)(7)).
