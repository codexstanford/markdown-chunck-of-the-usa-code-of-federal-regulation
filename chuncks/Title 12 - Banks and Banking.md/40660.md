#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### No introductory period.

A.If the loan product is an adjustable rate with no introductory rate, the creditor should disclose "0" where the introductory rate period would ordinarily be disclosed. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate that adjusts every three years with no introductory period, the disclosure required by § 1026.37(a)(10) is "0/3 Adjustable Rate."
