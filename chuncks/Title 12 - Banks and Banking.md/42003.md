#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Rate increases prior to effective date of rule.

4.For increases in annual percentage rates made on or after January 1, 2009, and prior to August 22, 2010, § 1026.59(a) requires the card issuer to review the factors described in § 1026.59(d) and reduce the rate, as appropriate, if the rate increase is of a type for which 45 days' advance notice would currently be required under § 1026.9(c)(2) or (g). For example, 45 days' notice is not required under § 1026.9(c)(2) if the rate increase results from the increase in the index by which a properly-disclosed variable rate is determined in accordance with § 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(C) or if the increase occurs upon expiration of a specified period of time and disclosures complying with § 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) have been provided. The requirements of § 1026.59 do not apply to such rate increases.
