### PART 1004-ALTERNATIVE MORTGAGE TRANSACTION PARITY (REGULATION D)
#### § 1004.4 Requirements for alternative mortgage transactions.
##### Renegotiable rates for renewable balloon-payment mortgages.

(b)A creditor that makes an alternative mortgage transaction with payments based on an amortization period and a large final payment due after a shorter term may negotiate an increase or decrease in the interest rate when the transaction is renewed only if the creditor makes a written commitment to renew the transaction at specified intervals throughout the amortization period. However, the creditor is not required to renew the transaction if:

(1) Any action or inaction by the consumer materially and adversely affects the creditor's security for the transaction or any right of the creditor in such security;

(2) There is a material failure by the consumer to meet the repayment terms of the transaction;

(3) There is fraud or a willful or knowing material misrepresentation by the consumer in connection with the transaction; or

(4) Federal law dealing with credit extended by a depository institution to its executive officers specifically requires that as a condition of the extension the credit shall become due and payable on demand, provided that the creditor includes such a provision in the initial agreement.
