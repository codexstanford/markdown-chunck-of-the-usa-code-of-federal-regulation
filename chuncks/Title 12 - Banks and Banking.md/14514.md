##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Modification or waiver.

1.A consumer may modify or waive the right to the three-day waiting period only after receiving the disclosures required by ยง 226.32 and only if the circumstances meet the criteria for establishing a bona fide personal financial emergency under ยง 226.23(e). Whether these criteria are met is determined by the facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure during the three-day period is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer entitled to the three-day waiting period must sign the handwritten statement for the waiver to be effective.
