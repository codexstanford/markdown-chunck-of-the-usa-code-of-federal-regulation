Regulation CC preempts state disclosure requirements concerning funds availability that relates tothat are inconsistent with the federal requirements. The state requirements are different from, and therefore inconsistent with, the federal disclosure rules. (ยง 229.20(c)(2)). Thus, the New Jersey statute (N.J.A.C. sections 3:1-15.1) is preempted by Regulation CC to the extent that these disclosure provisions apply toas defined by Regulation CC. The New Jersey disclosure rules would continue to apply to otheras defined by New Jersey law, including money market accounts and savings accounts established by a natural person for personal or family purposes, which are not governed by the Regulation CC disclosure requirements.

The Board has been requested, in accordance with ยง 229.20(d) of Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229), to determine whether the Expedited Funds Availability Act (the "Act") and subpart B (and in connection therewith, subpart A) of Regulation CC, preempt the provisions of New York law concerning the availability of funds. This preemption determination addresses the relation of the Act and Regulation CC to the New York funds availability law. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4-213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.)
