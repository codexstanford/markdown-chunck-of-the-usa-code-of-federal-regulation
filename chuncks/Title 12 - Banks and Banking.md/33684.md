#### Supplement I to Part 1003-Official Interpretations
##### Fixed-rate transactions.,i.e.,

i.For fixed-rate covered loans, the term for identifying the comparable transaction is the transaction's maturity (the period until the last payment will be due under the closed-end mortgage loan contract or open-end line of credit agreement). If an open-end credit plan has a fixed rate but no definite plan length, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by using a 30-year fixed-rate loan as the most closely comparable closed-end transaction. Financial institutions may refer to the table on the FFIEC website entitled "Average Prime Offer Rates-Fixed" when identifying a comparable fixed-rate transaction.
