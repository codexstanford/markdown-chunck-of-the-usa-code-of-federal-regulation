# Title 12 - Banks and Banking
## Chapter Xâ€”Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Covered persons.

1.The disclosure requirements of this section apply to any "covered person" that becomes the legal owner of an existing mortgage loan, whether through a purchase, or other transfer or assignment, regardless of whether the person also meets the definition of a "creditor" in Regulation Z. The fact that a person purchases or acquires mortgage loans and provides the disclosures under this section does not by itself make that person a "creditor" as defined in the regulation.
