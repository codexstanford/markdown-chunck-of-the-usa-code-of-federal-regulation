####### Permanent construction take-out loans.

(1)-(i) The permanent construction take-out loans preserve existing subsidies on affordable housing with regulatory periods of required affordability that are at least as restrictive as the longest affordability restriction applicable to the subsidy or subsidies being preserved; or

(ii) The permanent construction take-out loans are for housing developed under state or local inclusionary zoning, real estate tax abatement, or loan programs, where the property owner has agreed to restrict a portion of the units for occupancy by very low-, low-, or moderate-income families, and to restrict the rents that can be charged for those units at affordable rents to those populations, or where the property is developed for a shared equity program that meets the requirements under § 1282.34(d)(4), and where there is a regulatory agreement, recorded use restriction, or deed restriction in place that maintains affordability for the term defined by the state or local program.
