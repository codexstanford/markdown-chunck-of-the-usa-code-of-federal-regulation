###### § 390.413 Non-public offering.

Offers and sales of securities by an issuer that satisfy the conditions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall be deemed to be transactions not involving any public offering within the meaning of section 4(2) of the Securities Act and §§ 390.412(b) and 390.412(d). However, an issuer shall not be deemed to be not in compliance with the provisions of this subpart solely by reason of making an untimely filing of the notice required to be filed by paragraph (c) of this section so long as the notice is actually filed and all other conditions and requirements of this subpart are satisfied.
