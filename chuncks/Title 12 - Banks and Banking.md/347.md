### PART 3 - CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS
#### Subpart B - Capital Ratio Requirements and Buffers
##### ยง 3.11 Capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer amount.
###### Weighting.

(iii)The weight assigned to a jurisdiction's countercyclical capital buffer amount is calculated by dividing the total risk-weighted assets for the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures located in the jurisdiction by the total risk-weighted assets for all of the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures. The methodology a national bank or Federal savings association uses for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of this paragraph (b) must be the methodology that determines its risk-based capital ratios under ยง 3.10. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the risk-weighted asset amount for a private sector credit exposure that is a covered position under subpart F of this part is its specific risk add-on as determined under ยง 3.210 multiplied by 12.5.
