###### ยง 250.142 Meaning of "obligor or maker" in determining limitation on securities investments by member State banks.
####### obligor,obligor

(c) The Board considers that, within the meaning of these provisions of law,does not include any person that acts solely as a conduit for transmission of funds received from another source, irrespective of a promise by such person to pay principal or interest on the obligation. While an obligor does not cease to be such merely because a third person has agreed to pay the obligor amounts sufficient to cover principal and interest on the obligations when due, a person that promises to pay an obligation, but as a practical matter has no resources with which to assume payment of the obligation except the amounts received from such third person, is not anwithin the meaning of section 5136.
