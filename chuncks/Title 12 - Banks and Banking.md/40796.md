#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Credits or rebates from the creditor to offset a portion or all of the closing costs.

2.For loans where a portion or all of the closing costs are offset by a credit or rebate provided by the creditor (sometimes referred to as "no-cost" loans), whether all or a defined portion of the closing costs disclosed under § 1026.37(f) or (g) will be paid by a credit or rebate from the creditor, the creditor discloses such credit or rebate as a lender credit under § 1026.37(g)(6)(ii). The creditor should ensure that the lender credit disclosed under § 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) is sufficient to cover the estimated costs the creditor represented to the consumer as not being required to be paid by the consumer at consummation, regardless of whether such representations pertained to specific items.
