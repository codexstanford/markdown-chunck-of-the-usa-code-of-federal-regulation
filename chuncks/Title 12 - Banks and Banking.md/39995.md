##### Requirements.

1.For purposes of § 1026.19(f), a settlement agent is the person conducting the settlement. A settlement agent may provide the disclosures required under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) instead of the creditor. By assuming this responsibility, the settlement agent becomes responsible for complying with all of the relevant requirements of § 1026.19(f), meaning that "settlement agent" should be read in the place of "creditor" for all the relevant provisions of § 1026.19(f), except where such a reading would create responsibility for settlement agents under § 1026.19(e). For example, comment 19(f)(1)(ii)-3 explains that, in some cases involving transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan, a Loan Estimate must be provided under § 1026.19(e). "Settlement agent" could not be read in place of "creditor" in comment 19(f)(1)(ii)-3 because settlement agents are not responsible for the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i). To ensure timely and accurate compliance with the requirements of § 1026.19(f)(1)(v), the creditor and settlement agent need to communicate effectively.
