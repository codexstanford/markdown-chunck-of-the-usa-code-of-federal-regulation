#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Servicing.

iii.A loan servicer or a loan servicer's employees, agents, or contractors that otherwise meet the definition of "loan originator" are excluded from the definition when modifying or offering to modify an existing loan on behalf of the current owner or holder of the loan (including an assignee or the servicer, if applicable). Other than § 1026.36(c), § 1026.36 applies to extensions of consumer credit. Thus, other than § 1026.36(c), § 1026.36 does not apply if a person renegotiates, modifies, replaces, or subordinates an existing obligation or its terms, unless the transaction constitutes a refinancing under § 1026.20(a) or obligates a different consumer on the existing debt.
