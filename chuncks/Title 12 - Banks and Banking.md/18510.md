####### all

(b)(1) This section of the BESA provides that any portion of an eligible BA created by an institution subject to the BA limitations contained therein ("covered bank") that is conveyed through a participation to another covered bank shall not be included in the calculation of the creating bank's BA limits. The amount of the participation is to be applied to the calculation of the BA limits applicable to the covered bank receiving the participation. Although a covered bank that has reached its 150 or 200 percent limit can continue to create eligible acceptances by conveying participations to other covered banks, Congress has in effect imposed an aggregate limit on the eligible acceptances that may be created bycovered banks equal to the sum of 150 or 200 percent of the capital of all covered banks.
