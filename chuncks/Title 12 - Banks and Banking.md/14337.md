###### Rescission period.

1.The period within which the consumer may exercise the right to rescind runs for 3 business days from the last of 3 events:

- Consummation of the transaction.

- Delivery of all material disclosures.

- Delivery to the consumer of the required rescission notice.

For example, if a transaction is consummated on Friday, June 1, and the disclosures and notice of the right to rescind were given on Thursday, May 31, the rescission period will expire at midnight of the third business day after June 1-that is, Tuesday, June 5. In another example, if the disclosures are given and the transaction consummated on Friday, June 1, and the rescission notice is given on Monday, June 4, the rescission period expires at midnight of the third business day after June 4-that is, Thursday, June 7. The consumer must place the rescission notice in the mail, file it for telegraphic transmission, or deliver it to the creditor's place of business within that period in order to exercise the right.
