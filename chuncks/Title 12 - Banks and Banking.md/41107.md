#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Identifying the loan.

1.The disclosures required by this section must identify the loan that was acquired or transferred. The covered person has flexibility in determining what information to provide for this purpose and may use any information that would reasonably inform a consumer which loan was acquired or transferred. For example, the covered person may identify the loan by stating:

i. The address of the mortgaged property along with the account number or loan number previously disclosed to the consumer, which may appear in a truncated format;

ii. The account number alone, or other identifying number, if that number has been previously provided to the consumer, such as on a statement that the consumer receives monthly; or

iii. The date on which the credit was extended and the original amount of the loan or credit line.
