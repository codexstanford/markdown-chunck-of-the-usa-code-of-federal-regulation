###### ยง 223.14 What are the collateral requirements for a credit transaction with an affiliate?
####### Example.

(3)A member bank makes a $2,000 loan to an affiliate. The affiliate grants the member bank a second priority security interest in a piece of real estate valued at $3,000. Another institution that previously lent $1,000 to the affiliate has a first priority security interest in the entire parcel of real estate. This transaction is not in compliance with the collateral requirements of this section. Due to the existence of the prior third-party lien on the real estate, the effective value of the real estate collateral for the member bank for purposes of this section is only $2,000-$600 less than the amount of real estate collateral required by this section for the transaction ($2,000 x 130 percent = $2,600).
