####### Principle of conservatism.

(c)Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:

(1) The FDIC-supervised institution can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the FDIC that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;

(3) The FDIC-supervised institution notifies the FDIC in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and

(4) The exposures to which the FDIC-supervised institution applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the FDIC-supervised institution.
