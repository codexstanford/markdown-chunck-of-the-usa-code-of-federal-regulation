###### Restrictions on terms and features.

(2)Perpetual preferred stock included in tier 1 capital may not have any provisions restricting the banking organization's ability or legal right to defer or waive dividends, other than provisions requiring prior or concurrent deferral or waiver of payments on more junior instruments, which the Federal Reserve generally expects in such instruments consistent with the notion that the most junior capital elements should absorb losses first. Dividend deferrals or waivers for preferred stock, which the Federal Reserve expects will occur either voluntarily or at its direction when an organization is in a weakened condition, must not be subject to arrangements that would diminish the ability of the deferral to shore up the banking organization's resources. Any perpetual preferred stock with a feature permitting redemption at the option of the issuer may qualify as tier 1 capital only if the redemption is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Features that require, or create significant incentives for the issuer to redeem the instrument for cash or cash equivalents will render the instrument ineligible for inclusion in tier 1 capital. For example, perpetual preferred stock that has a credit-sensitive dividend feature-that is, a dividend rate that is reset periodically based, in whole or in part, on the banking organization's current credit standing-generally does not qualify for inclusion in tier 1 capital.Similarly, perpetual preferred stock that has a dividend rate step-up or a market value conversion feature-that is, a feature whereby the holder must or can convert the preferred stock into common stock at the market price prevailing at the time of conversion-generally does not qualify for inclusion in tier 1 capital.
