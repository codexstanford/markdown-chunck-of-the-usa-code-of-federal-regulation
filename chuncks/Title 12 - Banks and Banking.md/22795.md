####### ยง 324.144 Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA).
######## General requirements for the SSFA.

(a)To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, an FDIC-supervised institution must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. An FDIC-supervised institution that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.
