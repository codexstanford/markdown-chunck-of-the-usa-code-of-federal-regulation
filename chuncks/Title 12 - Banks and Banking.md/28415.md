###### ยง 617.7410 When and how does a qualified lender notify a borrower of the right to seek loan restructuring?
####### Whom should the qualified lender notify?

(d)The qualified lender is required to notify all primary obligors. If the obligors identify one party to receive notices, the qualified lender should send the original notice to that person and send copies to the other obligors. For borrowers in a bankruptcy proceeding, the qualified lender should send the notice to the borrower and, if retained, the borrower's counsel.
