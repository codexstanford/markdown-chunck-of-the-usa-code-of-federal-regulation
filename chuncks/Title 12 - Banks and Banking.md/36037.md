#### Subpart A-Privacy and Opt Out Notices
##### § 1016.7 Form of opt out notice to consumers; opt out methods.
###### Joint relationships in the case of credit unions.

(e)(1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service, other than a loan, from a credit union, the credit union may provide only a single opt out notice. The opt out notice must explain how the credit union will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer (as explained in the examples in paragraph (e)(5) of this section).

(2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. A credit union may either:

(i) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer to apply to all of the associated joint consumers; or

(ii) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately.

(3) If a credit union permits each joint consumer to opt out separately, the credit union must permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers.

(4) A credit union may not require all joint consumers to opt out before the credit union implements any opt out direction.
