### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Owner's title insurance policy rate.

1.The amount disclosed for an owner's title insurance premium pursuant to § 1026.37(g)(4) is based on a basic owner's policy rate, and not on an "enhanced" title insurance policy premium, except that the creditor may instead disclose the premium for an "enhanced" policy when the "enhanced" title insurance policy is required by the real estate sales contract, if such requirement is known to the creditor when issuing the Loan Estimate. This amount should be disclosed as "Title-Owner's Title Policy (optional)," or in any similar manner that includes the introductory description "Title -" at the beginning of the label for the item, the parenthetical description "(optional)" at the end of the label, and clearly indicates the amount of the premium disclosed pursuant to § 1026.37(g)(4) is for the owner's title insurance coverage. See comment 37(f)(2)-4 for a discussion of the disclosure of the premium for lender's title insurance coverage.
