###### Grace periods.

2.In disclosing whether or not a grace period exists, the creditor need not use "free period," "free-ride period," "grace period" or any other particular descriptive phrase or term. For example, a statement that "the finance charge begins on the date the transaction is posted to your account" adequately discloses that no grace period exists. In the same fashion, a statement that "finance charges will be imposed on any new purchases only if they are not paid in full within 25 days after the close of the billing cycle" indicates that a grace period exists in the interim.
