#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Affirmative request.

1.A creditor would not satisfy the requirement to obtain a consumer's affirmative request if the "request" was a response to a script that uses leading questions or negative consent. A question asking whether the consumer wishes to enroll in the credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension plan and seeking a yes-or-no response (such as "Do you want to enroll in this optional debt cancellation plan?") would not be considered leading.
