####### Common equity tier 1 capital.

(b)Common equity tier 1 capital is the sum of the common equity tier 1 capital elements in this paragraph (b), minus regulatory adjustments and deductions in ยง 324.22. The common equity tier 1 capital elements are:

(1) Any common stock instruments (plus any related surplus) issued by the FDIC-supervised institution, net of treasury stock, and any capital instruments issued by mutual banking organizations, that meet all the following criteria:

(i) The instrument is paid-in, issued directly by the FDIC-supervised institution, and represents the most subordinated claim in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding of the FDIC-supervised institution;

(ii) The holder of the instrument is entitled to a claim on the residual assets of the FDIC-supervised institution that is proportional with the holder's share of the FDIC-supervised institution's issued capital after all senior claims have been satisfied in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

(iii) The instrument has no maturity date, can only be redeemed via discretionary repurchases with the prior approval of the FDIC, and does not contain any term or feature that creates an incentive to redeem;

(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution did not create at issuance of the instrument through any action or communication an expectation that it will buy back, cancel, or redeem the instrument, and the instrument does not include any term or feature that might give rise to such an expectation;

(v) Any cash dividend payments on the instrument are paid out of the FDIC-supervised institution's net income and retained earnings and are not subject to a limit imposed by the contractual terms governing the instrument. An FDIC-supervised institution must obtain prior FDIC approval for any dividend payment involving a reduction or retirement of capital stock in accordance with 12 CFR 303.241;

(vi) The FDIC-supervised institution has full discretion at all times to refrain from paying any dividends and making any other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of any other restrictions on the FDIC-supervised institution;

(vii) Dividend payments and any other distributions on the instrument may be paid only after all legal and contractual obligations of the FDIC-supervised institution have been satisfied, including payments due on more senior claims;

(viii) The holders of the instrument bear losses as they occur equally, proportionately, and simultaneously with the holders of all other common stock instruments before any losses are borne by holders of claims on the FDIC-supervised institution with greater priority in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;

(ix) The paid-in amount is classified as equity under GAAP;

(x) The FDIC-supervised institution, or an entity that the FDIC-supervised institution controls, did not purchase or directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument;

(xi) The instrument is not secured, not covered by a guarantee of the FDIC-supervised institution or of an affiliate of the FDIC-supervised institution, and is not subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the instrument;

(xii) The instrument has been issued in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and

(xiii) The instrument is reported on the FDIC-supervised institution's regulatory financial statements separately from other capital instruments.

(2) Retained earnings.

(3) Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as reported under GAAP.

(4) Any common equity tier 1 minority interest, subject to the limitations in ยง 324.21.

(5) Notwithstanding the criteria for common stock instruments referenced above, an FDIC-supervised institution's common stock issued and held in trust for the benefit of its employees as part of an employee stock ownership plan does not violate any of the criteria in paragraph (b)(1)(iii), paragraph (b)(1)(iv) or paragraph (b)(1)(xi) of this section, provided that any repurchase of the stock is required solely by virtue of ERISA for an instrument of an FDIC-supervised institution that is not publicly-traded. In addition, an instrument issued by an FDIC-supervised institution to its employee stock ownership plan does not violate the criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(x) of this section.
