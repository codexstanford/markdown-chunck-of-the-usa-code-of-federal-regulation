####### § 324.51 Introduction and exposure measurement.
######## General.

(a)(1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to an investment fund, an FDIC-supervised institution must use the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) provided in § 324.52. An FDIC-supervised institution must use the look-through approaches provided in § 324.53 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.

(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 324.2) as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 324.53.
