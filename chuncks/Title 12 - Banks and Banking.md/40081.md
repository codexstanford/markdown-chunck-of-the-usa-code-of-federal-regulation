### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Escrow closing fee.

1.Section 1026.20(e)(2)(i) requires the creditor to itemize the amount of any fee the creditor or servicer imposes on the consumer in connection with the closure of the consumer's escrow account, labeled "Escrow Closing Fee." If the creditor or servicer independently decides to cancel the escrow account, rather than agreeing to close it at the request of the consumer, and does not charge a fee in connection with the cancellation, the creditor or service complies with § 1026.20(e)(2) by leaving the disclosure blank on the front-side of the one-page document described in § 1026.20(e)(4).
