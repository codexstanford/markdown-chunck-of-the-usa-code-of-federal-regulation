####### Cleared transaction

means an exposure associated with an outstanding derivative contract or repo-style transaction that an FDIC-supervised institution or clearing member has entered into with a central counterparty (that is, a transaction that a central counterparty has accepted).

(1) The following transactions are cleared transactions:

(i) A transaction between a CCP and an FDIC-supervised institution that is a clearing member of the CCP where the FDIC-supervised institution enters into the transaction with the CCP for the FDIC-supervised institution's own account;

(ii) A transaction between a CCP and an FDIC-supervised institution that is a clearing member of the CCP where the FDIC-supervised institution is acting as a financial intermediary on behalf of a clearing member client and the transaction offsets another transaction that satisfies the requirements set forth in ยง 324.3(a);

(iii) A transaction between a clearing member client FDIC-supervised institution and a clearing member where the clearing member acts as a financial intermediary on behalf of the clearing member client and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP, provided that the requirements set forth in ยง 324.3(a) are met; or

(iv) A transaction between a clearing member client FDIC-supervised institution and a CCP where a clearing member guarantees the performance of the clearing member client FDIC-supervised institution to the CCP and the transaction meets the requirements of ยง 324.3(a)(2) and (3).

(2) The exposure of an FDIC-supervised institution that is a clearing member to its clearing member client is not a cleared transaction where the FDIC-supervised institution is either acting as a financial intermediary and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP or where the FDIC-supervised institution provides a guarantee to the CCP on the performance of the client.
