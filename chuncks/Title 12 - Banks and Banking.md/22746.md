######## Credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event.

(e)If an FDIC-supervised institution recognizes an eligible credit derivative that does not include as a credit event a restructuring of the hedged exposure involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit loss event (that is, a charge-off, specific provision, or other similar debit to the profit and loss account), the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit derivative: P= Px 0.60, where:

(1) Pequals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for lack of restructuring event (and maturity mismatch, if applicable); and

(2) Pequals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant adjusted for maturity mismatch (if applicable).
