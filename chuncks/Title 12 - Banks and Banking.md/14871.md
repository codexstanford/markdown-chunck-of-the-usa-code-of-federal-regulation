Under § 226.48(c)(1), the date on which the acceptance period expires is based on when the consumer receives the disclosures. If the creditor mails the disclosures, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after the creditor places the disclosures in the mail§ 226.46(d)(4). If the creditor provides an acceptance period longer than the minimum 30 calendar days, the disclosure must reflect the later date. The disclosure must also specify the method or methods by which the consumer may communicate acceptance.
