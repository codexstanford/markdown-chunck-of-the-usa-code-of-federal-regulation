### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account.

1.Section 1026.61(a)(3)(i) determines whether a prepaid card triggers coverage as a hybrid prepaid-credit card under § 1026.61(a), and thus, whether a prepaid account issuer is a card issuer under § 1026.2(a)(7) subject to this regulation, including § 1026.61(b). However, § 1026.61(b) requires that any credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card must be structured as a separate credit feature using either a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account. Unless § 1026.61(a)(4) applies, a card issuer would violate § 1026.61(b) if it structures a credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account. A prepaid account issuer can use a negative asset balance structure to extend credit on a prepaid account if the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to that credit as described in § 1026.61(a)(4).
