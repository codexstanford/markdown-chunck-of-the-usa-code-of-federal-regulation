### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Subsequent changes in terms.

ii.The fact that an issuer may reserve the right to change a rate subsequent to account opening, pursuant to the notice requirements of § 1026.9(c) and the limitations in § 1026.55, does not, by itself, make that rate an introductory rate. For example, assume an issuer discloses an annual percentage rate for purchases of 12.99% but does not specify a time period during which that rate will be in effect. Even if that issuer subsequently increases the annual percentage rate for purchases to 15.99%, pursuant to a change-in-terms notice provided under § 1026.9(c), the 12.99% is not an introductory rate.
