#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Relation to the finance charge.

5.Section 1026.43(b)(8) includes in the evaluation of mortgage-related obligations premiums and similar charges identified in § 1026.4(b)(5), (7), (8), or (10) that are required by the creditor. These premiums and similar charges are mortgage-related obligations regardless of whether the premium or similar charge is excluded from the finance charge pursuant to § 1026.4(d). For example, a premium for insurance against loss or damage to the property written in connection with the credit transaction is a premium identified in § 1026.4(b)(8). If this premium is required by the creditor, the premium is a mortgage-related obligation pursuant to § 1026.43(b)(8), regardless of whether the premium is excluded from the finance charge pursuant to § 1026.4(d)(2).
