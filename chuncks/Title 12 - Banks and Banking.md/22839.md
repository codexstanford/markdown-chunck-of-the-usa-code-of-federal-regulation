####### ยง 324.161 Qualification requirements for incorporation of operational risk mitigants.
######## Qualifying operational risk mitigants.

(b)Qualifying operational risk mitigants are:

(1) Insurance that:

(i) Is provided by an unaffiliated company that the FDIC-supervised institution deems to have strong capacity to meet its claims payment obligations and the obligor rating category to which the FDIC-supervised institution assigns the company is assigned a PD equal to or less than 10 basis points;

(ii) Has an initial term of at least one year and a residual term of more than 90 days;

(iii) Has a minimum notice period for cancellation by the provider of 90 days;

(iv) Has no exclusions or limitations based upon regulatory action or for the receiver or liquidator of a failed depository institution; and

(v) Is explicitly mapped to a potential operational loss event;

(2) Operational risk mitigants other than insurance for which the FDIC has given prior written approval. In evaluating an operational risk mitigant other than insurance, the FDIC will consider whether the operational risk mitigant covers potential operational losses in a manner equivalent to holding total capital.
