1.Under § 1026.43(g)(3)(i), if a creditor offers a consumer a covered transaction with a prepayment penalty, the creditor must offer the consumer an alternative covered transaction without a prepayment penalty and with an annual percentage rate that cannot increase after consummation. Under § 1026.43(g)(3)(i), if the covered transaction with a prepayment penalty is a fixed-rate mortgage, as defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(iii), then the alternative covered transaction without a prepayment penalty must also be a fixed-rate mortgage. Likewise, if the covered transaction with a prepayment penalty is a step-rate mortgage, as defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(ii), then the alternative covered transaction without a prepayment penalty must also be a step-rate mortgage.
