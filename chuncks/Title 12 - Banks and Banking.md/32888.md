####### Records.

(a)The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of nonpublic records, including a requirement that you obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement with the other parties in the legal proceeding that limits access to and any further disclosure of the nonpublic records. The terms of a confidentiality agreement or protective order must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, the NCUA may condition the release of nonpublic records on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.
