2.Dividends will be compounded daily and will be credited quarterly. For this account type, the dividend period is quarterly, for example, the beginning date of the first dividend period of the calendar year is January 1 and the ending date of such dividend period is March 31. All other dividend periods follow this same pattern of dates. The dividend declaration date follows the ending date of a dividend period, and for the example is April 1. If you close your regular share account before dividends are credited, you will not receive accrued dividends.
