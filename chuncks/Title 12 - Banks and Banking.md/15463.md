###### Rating.

(3)The Board assesses the performance of a bank operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals:

(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the Board will rate the bank's performance under the plan as "satisfactory."

(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the Board will rate the bank's performance under the plan as "outstanding."

(iii) If the bank fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the Board will rate the bank as either "needs to improve" or "substantial noncompliance," depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, unless the bank elected in its plan to be rated otherwise, as provided in ยง 228.27(f)(4).
