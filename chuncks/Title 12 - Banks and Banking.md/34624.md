1.Section 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) permits, but does not require, a financial institution to include in the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts one additional line of text directing the consumer to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for information on ways the consumer may access payroll card account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. For example, a financial institution might include the following line of text in the short form disclosure: "See below for free ways to access your funds and balance information" and then list below, but on the same page as, the short form disclosure several ways consumers can access their prepaid account funds and balance information for free. Alternatively, the financial institution might direct the consumer to another location for that information, such as by stating "See the cardholder agreement for free ways to access your funds and balance information." A similar statement is permitted for government benefit accounts pursuant to § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii).
