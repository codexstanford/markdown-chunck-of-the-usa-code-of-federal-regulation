#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Deferred interest period clarified.

2.Although the terms of an advertised deferred interest or similar offer may provide that a creditor may charge the accrued interest if the balance is not paid in full by a certain date, creditors sometimes have an informal policy or practice that delays charging the accrued interest for payment received a brief period of time after the date upon which a creditor has the contractual right to charge the accrued interest. The advertisement need not include the end of an informal "courtesy period" in disclosing the deferred interest period under § 1026.16(h)(3).
