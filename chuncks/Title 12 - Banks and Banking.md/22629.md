####### § 324.132 Counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts.
######## Equity derivatives.

(4)An FDIC-supervised institution must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under §§ 324.151-324.155 (unless the FDIC-supervised institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part). In addition, if the FDIC-supervised institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part, and under certain other circumstances described in § 324.155, the FDIC-supervised institution must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this section.
