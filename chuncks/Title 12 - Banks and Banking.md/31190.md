###### minimum,highest

The credit union that computes dividends in this manner must provide a range that shows the lowest and the highest annual percentage yields for each tier (other than for the first tier, which, like the tiers in Method A, has the same annual percentage yield throughout). The low figure for an annual percentage yield is calculated based on the total amount of dividends earned for a year assuming theprincipal required to earn the dividend rate for that tier. The high figure for an annual percentage yield is based on the amount of dividends the credit union would pay on theprincipal that could be deposited to earn that same dividend rate. If the account does not have a limit on the amount that can be deposited, the credit union may assume any amount.

For the tiering structure assumed above, the credit union would state a total of five annual percentage yields-one figure for the first tier and two figures stated as a range for the other two tiers.
