###### Seller's name-sufficiency of description.

7.The requirement contemplates that the seller's name will appear on the periodic statement in essentially the same form as it appears on transaction documents provided to the consumer at the time of the sale. The seller's name may also be disclosed as, for example:

i. A more complete spelling of the name that was alphabetically abbreviated on the receipt or other credit document.

ii. An alphabetical abbreviation of the name on the periodic statement even if the name appears in a more complete spelling on the receipt or other credit document. Terms that merely indicate the form of a business entity, such as "Inc.," "Co.," or "Ltd.," may always be omitted.
