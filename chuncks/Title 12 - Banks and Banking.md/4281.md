Section 41.90 of this part requires each financial institution and creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as defined in ยง 41.90(b)(3) of this part, to develop and provide for the continued administration of a written Program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing covered account.
