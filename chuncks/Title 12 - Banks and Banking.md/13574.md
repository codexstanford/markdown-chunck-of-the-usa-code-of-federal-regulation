###### Amount of interest charge.

iii.Under ยง 226.7(b)(6)(ii), creditors must disclose interest charges imposed during a billing cycle. For some deferred interest purchases, the creditor may impose interest from the date of purchase if the deferred interest balance ($500 in this example) is not paid in full by July 31 in this example, but otherwise will not impose interest for billing cycles between the date of purchase and July 31. Periodic statements for billing cycles preceding July 31 in this example should not include in the interest charge disclosed under ยง 226.7(b)(6)(ii) the amounts a consumer may owe if the deferred interest balance is not paid in full by July 31. In this example, the February periodic statement should not identify as interest charges interest attributable to the $500 January purchase. This amount must be separately disclosed on periodic statements and identified by a term other than "interest charge" (such as "contingent interest charge" or "deferred interest charge"). The interest charge on a deferred interest balance should be reflected on the periodic statement under ยง 226.7(b)(6)(ii) for the billing cycle in which the interest charge is debited to the account.
