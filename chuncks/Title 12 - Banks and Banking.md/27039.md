##### Coversheets.

(h)Department of State (DSC) classified incoming cables are to be logged in and routed to the appropriate offices in double envelopes. When these cables are being used in various offices, classified coversheets must be used to protect the documents. This practice eliminates the possibility of inadvertently mixing classified with non-classified material, and promotes security awareness. Coversheets are obtainable from the Office of the Security Director.
