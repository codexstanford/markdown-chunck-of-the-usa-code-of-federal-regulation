##### Rates actually offered.

1.The disclosure may state only those rates that the creditor is actually prepared to offer. For example, a creditor may not disclose a very low interest rate that will not in fact be offered at any time. For a loan with variable interest rates, the ranges of rates will be considered actually offered if:

i. For disclosures in applications or solicitations sent by direct mail, the rates were in effect within 60 days before mailing;

ii. For disclosures in applications or solicitations in electronic form, the rates were in effect within 30 days before the disclosures are sent to a consumer, or for disclosures made on an Internet Web site, within 30 days before being viewed by the public;

iii. For disclosures in printed applications or solicitations made available to the general public, the rates were in effect within 30 days before printing; or

iv. For disclosures provided orally in telephone applications or solicitations, the rates are currently available at the time the disclosures are provided.
