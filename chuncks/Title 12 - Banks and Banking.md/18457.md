(d)When an NSFR liability of a Board-regulated institution is secured by an off-balance sheet asset or results from the Board-regulated institution selling an off-balance sheet asset (for instance, in the case of a short sale), other than an off-balance sheet asset received by the Board-regulated institution as variation margin under a derivative transaction:

(1) If the Board-regulated institution received the off-balance sheet asset under a lending transaction, an RSF factor is assigned to the lending transaction as if it were encumbered for the longer of:

(i) The remaining maturity of the NSFR liability; and

(ii) Any other encumbrance period applicable to the lending transaction;

(2) If the Board-regulated institution received the off-balance sheet asset under an asset exchange, an RSF factor is assigned to the asset provided by the Board-regulated institution in the asset exchange as if the provided asset were encumbered for the longer of:

(i) The remaining maturity of the NSFR liability; and

(ii) Any other encumbrance period applicable to the provided asset; or

(3) If the Board-regulated institution did not receive the off-balance sheet asset under a lending transaction or asset exchange, an RSF factor is assigned to the on-balance sheet asset resulting from the rehypothecation of the off-balance sheet asset as if the on-balance sheet asset were encumbered for the longer of:

(i) The remaining maturity of the NSFR liability; and

(ii) Any other encumbrance period applicable to the transaction through which the off-balance sheet asset was received.
