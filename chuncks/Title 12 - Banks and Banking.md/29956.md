A proposed area that meets the CDFI definition of an "investment area" (is "distressed" and has "significant unmet needs") must also be underserved by other insured depository institutions, including credit unions. 12 U.S.C. 1759(c)(2)(A)(ii). This statutory criterion is met when the concentration of depository institution facilities among the population of the proposed area's non-"distressed" tracts-which sets a benchmark level of adequate service-is greater than the concentration of facilities among the population of all of the proposed area's census tracts combined. This establishes the area's concentration of facilities ratio. If there are no non- "distressed" tracts within a proposed area, a non-"distressed" census tract or larger geographic unit (city or county) of the credit union's choice that adjoins the proposed area may be used to set the benchmark concentration ratio.

Without regard to a proposed area's location within or outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area, this criterion compares two ratios: the ratio of facilities to the population of the non- "distressed" tracts (the benchmark) versus the same facilities-to-population ratio among all the tracts of the proposed area as a whole. If the benchmark ratio is greater than the ratio for the whole area, then the area is "underserved by other depository institutions," and vice versa.
