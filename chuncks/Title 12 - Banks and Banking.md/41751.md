#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes.

C.Same facts as paragraphs A and B above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that-based on past delinquency rates and other factors relevant to potential delinquency rates for year two-it will experience a 2% decrease in delinquencies during year two (in other words, 20,000 fewer delinquencies for a total of 980,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect the same percentage of fees (25%) during year two as during year one (in other words, the card issuer will be unable to collect 245,000 fees, leaving a total of 735,000 late payments for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that-based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of delinquencies and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two-it will experience a 5% increase in costs during year two (in other words, $1.3 million in additional costs for a total of $27.3 million). For purposes of § 1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $37 late payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.
