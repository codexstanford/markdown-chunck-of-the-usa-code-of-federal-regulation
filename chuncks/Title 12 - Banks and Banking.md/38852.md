##### Credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.

4.i. An open-end consumer credit account is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan for purposes of § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) if:

A. The account is accessed by a credit card, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(15)(i); and

B. The account is not excluded under § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(A) through (C).

ii. As noted in § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C), the exclusion from credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan provided by that paragraph for an overdraft line of credit that is accessed by an account number does not apply to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card (including a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is solely an account number) as defined in § 1026.61.
