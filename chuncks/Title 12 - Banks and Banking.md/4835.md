### PART 44-PROPRIETARY TRADING AND CERTAIN INTERESTS IN AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH COVERED FUNDS
#### Appendix A to Part 44 - Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities
##### Description:

i.For purposes of this appendix, Internal Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk and the positions that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk. Usage represents the value of the trading desk's risk or positions that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk. Internal limits and their usage are key compliance and risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited to, the limits set out in §§ 44.4 and 44.5. A trading desk's risk limits, commonly including a limit on "Value-at-Risk," are useful in the broader context of the trading desk's overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under § 44.4(b) and hedging activity under § 44.5. Accordingly, the limits required under §§ 44.4(b)(2)(iii)(C) and 44.5(b)(1)(i)(A) must meet the applicable requirements under §§ 44.4(b)(2)(iii)(C) and 44.5(b)(1)(i)(A) and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, "Value-at-Risk" except to the extent the "Value-at-Risk" metric is demonstrably ineffective for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.

A. A banking entity must provide the following information for each limit reported pursuant to this quantitative measurement: The unique identification label for the limit reported in the Internal Limits Information Schedule, the limit size (distinguishing between an upper and a lower limit), and the value of usage of the limit.
