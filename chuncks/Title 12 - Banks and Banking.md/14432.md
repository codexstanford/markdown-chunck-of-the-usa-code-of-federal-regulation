###### Prohibited payments to loan originators.

5.For each transaction subject to the loan originator compensation provisions in ยง 226.36(d)(1), a creditor should maintain records of the compensation it provided to the loan originator for the transaction as well as the compensation agreement in effect on the date the interest rate was set for the transaction. See ยง 226.35(a) and comment 35(a)(2)(iii)-3 for additional guidance on when a transaction's rate is set. For example, where a loan originator is a mortgage broker, a disclosure of compensation or other broker agreement required by applicable state law that complies with ยง 226.25 would be presumed to be a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator in connection with the transaction.
