##### § 1081.211 Interlocutory review.
###### Director review.

(e)The Director will determine whether or not to review a ruling or order certified under this section or the subject of a petition for interlocutory review. Interlocutory review is generally disfavored. The Director may decline to review a ruling or order certified by a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or the petition of a party who has been denied certification if the Director determines that interlocutory review is not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances, in which case the Director may summarily deny the petition. If the Director determines to grant the review, the Director will review the matter and issue a ruling and order in an expeditious fashion, consistent with the Bureau's other responsibilities.
