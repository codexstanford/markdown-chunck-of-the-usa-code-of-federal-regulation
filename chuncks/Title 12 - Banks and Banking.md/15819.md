###### Model C-11A Availability of funds deposited at other locations.

8.A clause similar to Model C-11A should be used if a bank bases the availability of funds on the location where the funds are deposited (for example, at a contractual or other branch located in a different check processing region). Similarly, a clause similar to Model C-11A should be used if a bank distinguishes between local and non-local checks (for example, a bank using model availability policy disclosure C-4 or C-5), and accepts deposits in more than one check processing region.
