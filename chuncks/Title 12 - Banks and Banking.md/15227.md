###### Debt-cancellation coverage.

2.This regulation does not authorize creditors to characterize debt-cancellation fees as insurance premiums for purposes of this regulation. Creditors may provide a disclosure that refers to debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage whether or not the coverage is considered insurance. Creditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation coverage constitutes insurance under state law.
