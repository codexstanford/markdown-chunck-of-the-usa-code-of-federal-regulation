####### Payment of sender's obligation to a Federal Reserve Bank.

(a)When a sender sends a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts the payment order by issuing a conforming order executing the sender's payment order, under section 4A-402, the sender is indebted to the Federal Reserve Bank for the amount of the payment order. Section 4A-403 specifies the various methods by which a sender may settle the obligation under section 4A-402. With respect to a payment order sent through the FedNow Service, the obligation of a sender (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) is settled by a debit to the account of the sender at a Federal Reserve Bank. Section 210.43(a) provides that a sender, other than a Federal Reserve Bank, that maintains or uses a settlement account at a Federal Reserve Bank authorizes its Federal Reserve Bank to debit, or cause any other Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained to debit, that account, so that the Federal Reserve Bank can obtain payment for the payment order.
