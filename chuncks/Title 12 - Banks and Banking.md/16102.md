###### i.e.,

i. Some cards, or other payment codes or devices, may have both credit- and debit-like features ("hybrid cards"). For example, these cards may enable a cardholder to access a line of credit, but select certain transactions for immediate repayment (prior to the end of a billing cycle) via a debit to the cardholder's account, as the term is defined in ยง 235.2(a), held either with the issuer or at another institution. If a card permits a cardholder to initiate transactions that debit an account or funds underlying a prepaid card, the card is considered a debit card for purposes of this part. Not all transactions initiated by such a hybrid card, however, are electronic debit transactions. Rather, only those transactions that debit an account as defined in this part or funds underlying a prepaid card are electronic debit transactions. If the transaction posts to a line of credit, then the transaction is a credit transaction.

ii. If an issuer conditions the availability of a credit or charge card that permits pre-authorized repayment of some or all transactions on the cardholder maintaining an account at the issuer, such a card is considered a debit card for purposes of this part.
