(2)An institution may also apply to the FDIC for an exemption from the prepayment requirement under paragraph (a) of this section if the prepayment would significantly impair the institution's liquidity, or would otherwise create extraordinary hardship. Written applications for exemption from the prepayment obligation must be submitted to the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection on or before December 1, 2009, by electronic mail () or fax (202-898-6676). The application must contain a full explanation of the need for the exemption and provide supporting documentation, including current financial statements, cash flow projections, and any other relevant information, including any information the FDIC may request. The FDIC will exercise its discretion in deciding whether to exempt an institution that files an application for exemption. An application shall be deemed denied unless the FDIC notifies an applying institution by December 15, 2009, either that the institution is exempt from the prepaid assessment or the FDIC has postponed determination under paragraph (i)(4) of this section. The FDIC's denial of applications for exemption will be final and not subject to further agency review.
