###### Lien status.

2.The lien status of the mortgage is irrelevant for purposes of the exemption in ยง 226.23(f)(1); the fact that a loan has junior lien status does not by itself preclude application of this exemption. For example, a home buyer may assume the existing first mortgage and create a second mortgage to finance the balance of the purchase price. Such a transaction would not be rescindable.
