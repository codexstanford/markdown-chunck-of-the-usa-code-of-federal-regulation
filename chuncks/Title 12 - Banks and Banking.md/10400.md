##### Interpretations
###### ยง 221.102 Application to committed credit where funds are disbursed thereafter.

The Board has concluded that the date a commitment to extend credit becomes binding should be regarded as the date when the credit is extended, since:

(a) On that date the parties should be aware of law and facts surrounding the transaction; and

(b) Generally, the date of contract is controlling for purposes of margin regulations and Federal securities law, regardless of the delivery of cash or securities.
