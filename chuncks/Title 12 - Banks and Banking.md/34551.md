#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### Disclosures that are not applicable or are free.

1.The short form disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2) must always be provided prior to prepaid account acquisition, even when a particular feature is free or is not applicable to a specific prepaid account product. For example, if a financial institution does not charge a fee to a consumer for withdrawing money at an automated teller machine in the financial institution's network or an affiliated network, which is required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), the financial institution would list "ATM withdrawal in-network" on the short form disclosure and list "$0" as the fee. If, however, the financial institution does not have its own network or an affiliated network from which a consumer can withdraw money via automated teller machine, the financial institution would list "ATM withdrawal in-network" on the short form disclosure but instead of disclosing a fee amount, state "N/A." (The financial institution must still disclose any fee it charges for out-of-network ATM withdrawals.)
