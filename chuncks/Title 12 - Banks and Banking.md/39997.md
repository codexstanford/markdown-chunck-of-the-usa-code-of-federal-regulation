#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Creditor responsibilities.

3.If a settlement agent provides disclosures required under § 1026.19(f) in the creditor's place, the creditor remains responsible under § 1026.19(f) for ensuring that the requirements of § 1026.19(f) have been satisfied. For example, if the settlement agent assumes the responsibility for providing all of the disclosures required under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i), the creditor does not comply with § 1026.19(f) if the settlement agent does not provide these disclosures at all, or if the consumer receives the disclosures later than three business days before consummation, as required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) and, as applicable, (f)(2)(ii). The creditor does not satisfy the requirements of § 1026.19(f) if it provides duplicative disclosures. For example, a creditor does not satisfy its obligation by issuing disclosures required under § 1026.19(f) that mirror ones already issued by the settlement agent for the purpose of demonstrating that the consumer received timely disclosures. The creditor is expected to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor. Disclosures provided by a settlement agent in accordance with § 1026.19(f)(1)(v) satisfy the creditor's obligation under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i).
