##### ยง 721.4 How may a credit union apply to engage in an activity that is not preapproved as within a credit union's incidental powers?
###### Application contents.

(a)To engage in an activity that may be within an FCU's incidental powers but that does not fall within a preapproved category listed in ยง 721.3, you may submit an application by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the NCUA Board. Your application must describe the activity, your explanation, consistent with the test provided in paragraph (c) of this section, of why this activity is within your incidental powers, your plan for implementing the proposed activity, any state licenses you must obtain to conduct the activity, and any other information necessary to describe the proposed activity adequately. Before you engage in the petition process you should seek an advisory opinion from NCUA's Office of General Counsel, as to whether a proposed activity fits into one of the authorized categories or is otherwise within your incidental powers without filing a petition to amend the regulation.
