#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Fixed-rate mortgage with interest-only payments for five years.

i.A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7 percent, and permits interest-only payments for the first five years. The monthly payment of $1,167 scheduled for the first five years would cover only the interest due. The loan is recast on the due date of the 60th monthly payment, after which the scheduled monthly payments increase to $1,414, a monthly payment that repays the loan amount of $200,000 over the 25 years remaining as of the date the loan is recast (300 months). For purposes of § 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must determine the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on a payment of $1,414, which is the substantially equal, monthly, fully amortizing payment that would repay $200,000 over the 25 years remaining as of the date the loan is recast using the fixed interest rate of 7 percent.
