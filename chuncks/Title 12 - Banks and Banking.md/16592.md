####### Board review.

(a)(1) In determining whether to approve an exemption application filed under ยง 238.87, the Board will consider the extent to which the position that is the subject of the application enables a person to:

(i) Participate in the major policymaking functions of the savings and loan holding company; or

(ii) Threaten the safety and soundness of any insured depository institution that is controlled by the savings and loan holding company, the interests of its depositors, or the public confidence in the insured depository institution.

(2) The Board will also consider whether the applicant has demonstrated the person's fitness to hold the described position. Some positions may be approved without an extensive review of a person's fitness because the position does not enable a person to take the actions described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
