######## Segmentation of retail exposures.

(2)(i) The FDIC-supervised institution must group the retail exposures in each retail subcategory into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics.

(iii) If the FDIC-supervised institution determines the EAD for eligible margin loans using the approach in ยง 324.132(b), the FDIC-supervised institution must identify which of its retail exposures are eligible margin loans for which the FDIC-supervised institution uses this EAD approach and must segment such eligible margin loans separately from other retail exposures.
