####### Adjusted allowances for credit losses (AACL)

means, with respect to an FDIC-supervised institution that has adopted CECL, valuation allowances that have been established through a charge against earnings or retained earnings for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and a lessor's net investment in leases that have been established to reduce the amortized cost basis of the assets to amounts expected to be collected as determined in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of this part, adjusted allowances for credit losses include allowances for expected credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted allowances for credit losses exclude "allocated transfer risk reserves" and allowances created that reflect credit losses on purchased credit deteriorated assets and available-for-sale dbt securities.
