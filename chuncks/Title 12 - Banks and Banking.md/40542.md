##### 3,

1. The definition of loan originator does not include an employee of a manufactured home retailer that "assists" a consumer in obtaining or applying for consumer credit as defined in comment 36(a)-1.i.A.provided the employee does not advise the consumer on specific credit terms, or otherwise engage in loan originator activity as defined in § 1026.36(a)(1). The following examples describe activities that, in the absence of other activities, do not define a manufactured home retailer employee as a loan originator:

i. Generally describing the credit application process to a consumer without advising on credit terms available from a creditor.

ii. Preparing residential mortgage loan packages, which means compiling and processing loan application materials and supporting documentation, and providing general application instructions to consumers so consumers can complete an application, without interacting or communicating with the consumer regarding transaction terms, but not filling out a consumer's application, inputting the information into an online application or other automated system, or taking information from the consumer over the phone to complete the application.

iii. Collecting information on behalf of the consumer with regard to a residential mortgage loan. Collecting information "on behalf of the consumer" would include gathering information or supporting documentation from third parties on behalf of the consumer to provide to the consumer, for the consumer then to provide in the application or for the consumer to submit to the loan originator or creditor.
