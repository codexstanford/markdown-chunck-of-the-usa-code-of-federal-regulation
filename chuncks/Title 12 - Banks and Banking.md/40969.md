2.Section 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)() requires that, in a purchase transaction as defined in § 1026.37(a)(9)(i) that is a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction or that involves improvements to be made on the property, or when the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.38(b) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) exceeds the sale price disclosed under § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A), the amount of funds from the consumer is determined in accordance with § 1026.38(i)(6)(iv). Pursuant to § 1026.38(i)(6)(iv), the "Final" amount of "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" to be disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)() is determined by subtracting the sum of the loan amount and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) (excluding any closing costs financed disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(3)(ii)) from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v). The amount of "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" under the subheading "Final" is disclosed either as a positive number or $0, depending on the result of the calculation. When the result of the calculation is positive, that amount is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)() as "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower," and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(6)(ii) as "Funds for Borrower." When the result of the calculation is negative, that amount is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(6)(ii) as "Funds for Borrower," and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)() as "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower." When the result is $0, $0 is disclosed as "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" and "Funds for Borrower" under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)() and (6)(ii), respectively. An increase in the amount of "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" under the subheading "Final" relative to the corresponding amount under the subheading "Loan Estimate" might result, for example, from a decrease in the loan amount or an increase in the amount of existing debt being satisfied in the transaction. For additional discussion of the determination of the "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" amount, see comment 38(i)(6)(ii)-1.
