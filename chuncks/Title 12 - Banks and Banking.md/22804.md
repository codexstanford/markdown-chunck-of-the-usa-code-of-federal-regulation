######## ECL for securitization exposures.

(2)When an FDIC-supervised institution recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative provided by an eligible guarantor in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must also:

(i) Calculate ECL for the protected portion of the exposure using the same risk parameters that it uses for calculating the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

(ii) Add the exposure's ECL to the FDIC-supervised institution's total ECL.
