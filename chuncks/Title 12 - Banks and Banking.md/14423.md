###### Misleading claims of debt elimination.

3.The prohibition against misleading claims of debt elimination or waiver or forgiveness does not apply to legitimate statements that the advertised product may reduce debt payments, consolidate debts, or shorten the term of the debt. Examples of misleading claims of debt elimination or waiver or forgiveness of loan terms with, or obligations to, another creditor of debt include: "Wipe-Out Personal Debts!", "New DEBT-FREE Payment", "Set yourself free; get out of debt today", "Refinance today and wipe your debt clean!", "Get yourself out of debt * * * Forever!", and "Pre-payment Penalty Waiver."
