###### Pass-through investments; notice procedure.

(e)Except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (i) of this section, a Federal savings association may make a pass-through investment, directly or through its operating subsidiary, in an enterprise that engages in an activity described in ยง 5.38(f)(5) or in an activity that is substantively the same as a previously approved activity by filing a written notice. The Federal savings association must file this written notice with the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than 10 days after making the investment. The written notice must:

(1) Describe the structure of the investment and the activity or activities conducted by the enterprise in which the Federal savings association is investing. To the extent the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the Federal savings association with a company engaged in insurance activities, the savings association should describe the type of insurance activity that the company is engaged in and has present plans to conduct. The Federal savings association must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable;

(2) State:

(i) Which paragraphs of ยง 5.38(f)(5) describe the activity; or

(ii) If the activity is substantively the same as a previously approved activity:

(A) How, the activity is substantively the same as a previously approved activity;

(B) The citation to the applicable precedent; and

(C) That the activity will be conducted in accordance with the same terms and conditions applicable to the previously approved activity;

(3) Certify that the Federal savings association is well capitalized and well managed at the time of the investment;

(4) Describe how the Federal savings association has the ability to prevent the enterprise from engaging in an activity that is not set forth in ยง 5.38(f)(5) or not contained in published OCC (including published former OTS) precedent for previously approved activities, or how the savings association otherwise has the ability to withdraw its investment;

(5) Describe how the investment is convenient and useful to the Federal savings association in carrying out its business and not a mere passive investment unrelated to the savings association's banking business;

(6) Certify that the Federal savings association's loss exposure is limited as a legal matter and that the savings association does not have unlimited liability for the obligations of the enterprise; and

(7) Certify that the enterprise in which the Federal savings association is investing agrees to be subject to OCC supervision and examination, subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).
