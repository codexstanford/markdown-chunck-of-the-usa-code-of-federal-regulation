## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### i.e.,

ii. The card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Bureau under § 1026.58(c)(1). (The card issuer has more than 10,000 open accounts, so the § 1026.58(c)(5) de minimis exception does not apply. The agreement is offered solely for two different private label credit card plans (one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A and one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B and its affiliates, Merchants C and D), but both of these plans have more than 10,000 open accounts, so the § 1026.58(c)(6) private label credit card exception does not apply. Finally, the agreement is not offered solely in connection with a product test by the card issuer, so the § 1026.58(c)(7) product test exception does not apply.)
