#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### Sender as designated recipient.

3.A "sender," as defined in § 1005.30(g), may also be a designated recipient if the sender meets the definition of "designated recipient" in § 1005.30(c). For example, a sender may request that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the sender would also be a designated recipient.
