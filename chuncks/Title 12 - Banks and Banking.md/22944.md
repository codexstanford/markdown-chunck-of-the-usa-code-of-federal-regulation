####### Quantitative requirements for VaR-based measure.

(b)(1) The VaR-based measure must be calculated on a daily basis using a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a holding period equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates, spreads, and prices. To calculate VaR-based measures using a 10-business-day holding period, the FDIC-supervised institution may calculate 10-business-day measures directly or may convert VaR-based measures using holding periods other than 10 business days to the equivalent of a 10-business-day holding period. An FDIC-supervised institution that converts its VaR-based measure in such a manner must be able to justify the reasonableness of its approach to the satisfaction of the FDIC.

(2) The VaR-based measure must be based on a historical observation period of at least one year. Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the FDIC-supervised institution's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements. The FDIC-supervised institution must update data sets at least monthly or more frequently as changes in market conditions or portfolio composition warrant. For an FDIC-supervised institution that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the FDIC-supervised institution must either:

(i) Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or

(ii) Demonstrate to the FDIC that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the FDIC-supervised institution's trading portfolio over a full business cycle. An FDIC-supervised institution using this option must update its data more frequently than monthly and in a manner appropriate for the type of weighting scheme.

(c) An FDIC-supervised institution must divide its portfolio into a number of significant subportfolios approved by the FDIC for subportfolio backtesting purposes. These subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the FDIC-supervised institution and the FDIC to assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the risk factor level; the FDIC will evaluate the appropriateness of these subportfolios relative to the value and composition of the FDIC-supervised institution's covered positions. The FDIC-supervised institution must retain and make available to the FDIC the following information for each subportfolio for each business day over the previous two years (500 business days), with no more than a 60-day lag:

(1) A daily VaR-based measure for the subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level;

(2) The daily profit or loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net change in price of the positions held in the portfolio at the end of the previous business day); and

(3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each day (that is, the probability of observing a profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater than, the amount reported for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the model used to calculate the VaR-based measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
