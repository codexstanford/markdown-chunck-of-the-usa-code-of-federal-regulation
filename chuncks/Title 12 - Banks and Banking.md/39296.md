#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Date-sufficiency of description.

4.i. If the creditor discloses only the date of the transaction, the creditor need not identify it as the "transaction date." If the creditor discloses more than one date (for example, the transaction date and the posting date), the creditor must identify each.

ii. The month and day sufficiently identify the transaction date, unless the posting of the transaction is delayed so long that the year is needed for a clear disclosure to the consumer.
