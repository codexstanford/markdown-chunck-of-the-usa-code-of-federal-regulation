###### Regulatory capital deductions from common equity tier 1 capital.

(a)A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from the sum of its common equity tier 1 capital elements the items set forth in this paragraph (a):

(1)(i) Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; and

(ii) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association, goodwill that is embedded in the valuation of a significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution in the form of common stock (and that is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association), in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;

(2) Intangible assets, other than MSAs, net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

(3) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

(4) Any gain-on-sale in connection with a securitization exposure;

(5)(i) Any defined benefit pension fund net asset, net of any associated DTL in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, held by a depository institution holding company. With the prior approval of the OCC, this deduction is not required for any defined benefit pension fund net asset to the extent the depository institution holding company has unrestricted and unfettered access to the assets in that fund.

(ii) For an insured depository institution, no deduction is required.

(iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight any portion of the defined benefit pension fund asset that is not deducted under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) or (a)(5)(ii) of this section as if the national bank or Federal savings association directly holds a proportional ownership share of each exposure in the defined benefit pension fund.

(6) For an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to ยง 3.121(d), the amount of expected credit loss that exceeds its eligible credit reserves; and

(7) With respect to a financial subsidiary, the aggregate amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's outstanding equity investment, including retained earnings, in its financial subsidiaries (as defined in [12 CFR 5.39 (OCC); 12 CFR 208.77 (Board))]. A national bank or Federal savings association must not consolidate the assets and liabilities of a financial subsidiary with those of the parent bank, and no other deduction is required under paragraph (c) of this section for investments in the capital instruments of financial subsidiaries.

(8)(i) A Federal savings association must deduct the aggregate amount of its outstanding investments (both equity and debt) in, and extensions of credit to, subsidiaries that are not includable subsidiaries as defined in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section and may not consolidate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary with those of the Federal savings association. Any such deductions shall be deducted from assets and common equity tier 1 except as provided in paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

(ii) If a Federal savings association has any investments (both debt and equity) in, or extensions or credit to, one or more subsidiaries engaged in any activity that would not fall within the scope of activities in which includable subsidiaries as defined in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section may engage, it must deduct such investments and extensions of credit from assets and, thus, common equity tier 1 in accordance with paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section.

(iii) If a Federal savings association holds a subsidiary (either directly or through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository institution, the OCC may, in its sole discretion upon determining that the amount of common equity tier 1 that would be required would be higher if the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with those of the parent Federal savings association than the amount that would be required if the parent Federal savings association's investment were deducted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section, consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary with those of the parent Federal savings association in calculating the capital adequacy of the parent Federal savings association, regardless of whether the subsidiary would otherwise be an includable subsidiary as defined in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section.

(iv) For purposes of this section, the term includable subsidiary means a subsidiary of a Federal savings association that:

(A) Is engaged solely in activities not impermissible for a national bank;

(B) Is engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank, but only if acting solely as agent for its customers and such agency position is clearly documented in the Federal savings association's files;

(C) Is engaged solely in mortgage-banking activities;
