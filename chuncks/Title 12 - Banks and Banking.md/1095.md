(ii) The results of any off-site supervision indicate a deterioration in the condition of the Federal branch or agency;

(iii) The size, relative importance, and role of a particular office when reviewed in the context of the foreign bank's entire U.S. operations otherwise necessitate an annual examination; and

(iv) The condition of the foreign bank gives rise to such a need.
