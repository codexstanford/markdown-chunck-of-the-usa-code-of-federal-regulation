### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Statement that the consumer should see details.,i.e.,

1.Under § 1026.38(i)(7)(iii)(A), if the amount disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(7)(ii) in the "Final" column is not equal to the amount disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(7)(i) in the "Loan Estimate" column (unless the difference is due to rounding), the creditor must disclose a statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed either: (1) Under § 1026.38(j)(2)(v) in the summaries of transactions table and the seller-paid column of the closing cost details table under § 1026.38(f) or (g); or (2) if the difference is attributable only to general seller credits disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(v), or only to specific seller credits disclosed in the seller-paid column of the closing cost details table under § 1026.38(f) or (g), under only the applicable provision. If, for example, a decrease in the seller credits disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(7)(ii) is attributable only to a decrease in general (lump sum) seller credits, then a statement is given under the subheading "Did this change?" in the calculating cash to close table that the consumer should see the details disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(v) in the summaries of transactions table and the seller-paid column of § 1026.38(f) or (g), or that the consumer should see the details disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(v) in the summaries of transactions table. Form H-25(B) in appendix H to this part demonstrates this disclosure where the decrease in seller credits is attributable only to a decrease in general seller credits and the creditor choses only to reference the applicable provision; form H-25(B)'s statement "See Seller Credits in Section L," in which the words "Section L" are in boldface font, complies with this requirement. Where the decrease in the seller credits disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(7)(ii) is attributable to specific and general seller credits, or the creditor does not elect to reference only the applicable provision, then a statement is given under the subheading "Did this change?" that the consumer should see both the details disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(v) in the summaries of transactions table and the seller-paid column of the closing cost details table under § 1026.38(f) or (g). For example, the statement "See Seller-Paid column on page 2 and Seller Credits in Section L," in which the words "Seller-Paid" and "Section L" are in boldface font, complies with this requirement.
