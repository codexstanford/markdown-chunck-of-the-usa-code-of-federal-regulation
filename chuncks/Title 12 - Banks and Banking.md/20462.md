####### Waiver of penalty for deficient reserves.

(10)To waive the penalty for deficient reserves by a member bank if, after a review of all the circumstances relating to the deficiency, the Reserve Bank concludes that waiver is warranted, except that in no case may a penalty be waived if the deficiency in reserves arises out of the bank's gross negligence or conduct inconsistent with the principles and purposes of reserve requirements.
