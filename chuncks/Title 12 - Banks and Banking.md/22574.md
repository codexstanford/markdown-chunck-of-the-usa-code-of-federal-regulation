######## Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.

(i)(1) The FDIC-supervised institution's senior management must ensure that all components of the FDIC-supervised institution's advanced systems function effectively and comply with the qualification requirements in this section.

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution's board of directors (or a designated committee of the board) must at least annually review the effectiveness of, and approve, the FDIC-supervised institution's advanced systems.

(3) An FDIC-supervised institution must have an effective system of controls and oversight that:

(i) Ensures ongoing compliance with the qualification requirements in this section;

(ii) Maintains the integrity, reliability, and accuracy of the FDIC-supervised institution's advanced systems; and

(iii) Includes adequate governance and project management processes.

(4) The FDIC-supervised institution must validate, on an ongoing basis, its advanced systems. The FDIC-supervised institution's validation process must be independent of the advanced systems' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must include:

(i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the advanced systems;

(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking; and

(iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting.

(5) The FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal audit function or equivalent function that is independent of business-line management that at least annually:

(i) Reviews the FDIC-supervised institution's advanced systems and associated operations, including the operations of its credit function and estimations of PD, LGD, and EAD;

(ii) Assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the FDIC-supervised institution's advanced systems; and

(iii) Documents and reports its findings to the FDIC-supervised institution's board of directors (or a committee thereof).

(6) The FDIC-supervised institution must periodically stress test its advanced systems. The stress testing must include a consideration of how economic cycles, especially downturns, affect risk-based capital requirements (including migration across rating grades and segments and the credit risk mitigation benefits of double default treatment).
