### Subchapter C - Enterprises
#### PART 1240 - CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF ENTERPRISES
##### Subpart D - Risk-Weighted Assets - Standardized Approach
###### § 1240.40 Unsettled transactions.
####### Non-DvP/non-PvP (non-delivery-versus-payment/non-payment-versus-payment) transactions.

(e)(1) An Enterprise must hold risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the Enterprise has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business day. The Enterprise must continue to hold risk-based capital against the transaction until the Enterprise has received its corresponding deliverables.

(2) From the business day after the Enterprise has made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty delivery is due, the Enterprise must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the transaction by treating the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the Enterprise as an exposure to the counterparty and using the applicable counterparty risk weight under this subpart D.

(3) If the Enterprise has not received its deliverables by the fifth business day after counterparty delivery was due, the Enterprise must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the Enterprise.
