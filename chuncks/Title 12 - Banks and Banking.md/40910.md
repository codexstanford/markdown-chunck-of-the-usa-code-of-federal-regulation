#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Statements that the consumer should see details.

4.The provisions of § 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A) and (e)(4)(iii)(A) each require a statement that the consumer should see certain details of the closing costs disclosed under § 1026.38(f), (g), or (t).

For example, § 1026.38(e)(4)(iii)(A) requires a statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed pursuant to § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B), and, as shown on forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of appendix H to this part, the statement, "See Payoffs and Payments," in which the words "Payoffs and Payments" are in boldface, complies with this provision.
