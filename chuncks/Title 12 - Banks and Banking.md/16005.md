###### Money settlements.

(9)The designated financial market utility conducts its money settlements in central bank money where practical and available. If central bank money is not used, the designated financial market utility minimizes and strictly controls the credit and liquidity risks arising from conducting its money settlements in commercial bank money, including settlement on its own books. If it conducts its money settlements at a commercial bank, the designated financial market utility-

(i) Establishes and monitors adherence to criteria based on high standards for its settlement banks that take account of, among other things, their applicable regulatory and supervisory frameworks, creditworthiness, capitalization, access to liquidity, and operational reliability;

(ii) Monitors and manages the concentration of credit and liquidity exposures to its commercial settlement banks; and

(iii) Ensures that its legal agreements with its settlement banks state clearly-

(A) When transfers on the books of individual settlement banks are expected to occur;

(B) That transfers are final when funds are credited to the recipient's account; and

(C) That the funds credited to the recipient are available immediately for retransfer or withdrawal.
