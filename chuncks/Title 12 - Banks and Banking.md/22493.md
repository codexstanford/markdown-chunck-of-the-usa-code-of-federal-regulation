####### ยง 324.41 Operational requirements for securitization exposures.
######## Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations.

(b)For synthetic securitizations, an FDIC-supervised institution may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each condition in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. An FDIC-supervised institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. An FDIC-supervised institution that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:

(1) The credit risk mitigant is:

(i) Financial collateral;

(ii) A guarantee that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of "eligible guarantee" in ยง 324.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of that definition; or

(iii) A credit derivative that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of "eligible credit derivative" in ยง 324.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of the definition of "eligible guarantee" in ยง 324.2.

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:

(i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

(ii) Require the FDIC-supervised institution to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

(iii) Increase the FDIC-supervised institution's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;

(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the FDIC-supervised institution in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or

(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the FDIC-supervised institution after the inception of the securitization;

(3) The FDIC-supervised institution obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and

(4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.
