##### Marketed or labeled as,prepaid."

3."The term "marketed or labeled as `prepaid' " means promoting or advertising an account using the term "prepaid." For example, an account is marketed or labeled as prepaid if the term "prepaid" appears on the access device associated with the account or the access device's packaging materials, or on a display, advertisement, or other publication to promote purchase or use of the account. An account may be marketed or labeled as prepaid if the financial institution, its service provider, including a program manager, or the payment network on which an access device for the account is used, promotes or advertises, or contracts with another party to promote or advertise, the account using the label "prepaid." A product or service that is marketed or labeled as prepaid is not a "prepaid account" pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C) if it does not otherwise meet the definition of account under § 1005.2(b)(1).
