###### Index Cessation Effective Date

"" means, in respect of a Relevant IBOR (or, if either the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing is the Relevant IBOR, U.S. dollar LIBOR) and one or more Index Cessation Events, the first date on which the Relevant IBOR (or, if either the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing is the Relevant IBOR, U.S. dollar LIBOR) is either (a) in respect of a Relevant LIBOR (or, if the Relevant IBOR is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing, in respect of U.S. dollar LIBOR), Non-Representative by reference to the most recent statement or publication contemplated in subparagraph (c) of the definition of "Index Cessation Event" below and even if such rate continues to be provided on such date or (b) no longer provided. If the Relevant IBOR (or, if either the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing is the Relevant IBOR, U.S. dollar LIBOR) ceases to be provided on the Relevant Original Fixing Date but it was provided (and, in respect of a Relevant LIBOR (or, if the Relevant IBOR is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing, in respect of U.S. dollar LIBOR), is not Non-Representative) at the time at which it is ordinarily observed, then the Index Cessation Effective Date will be the next day on which the rate would ordinarily have been published. An Index Cessation Effective Date may also occur in accordance with paragraph 6(d), subparagraph 6(e)(ii) or subparagraph 6(e)(iii) above.
