##### Good faith analysis for lender credits.

6.For purposes of conducting the good faith analysis required under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) for lender credits, the total amount of lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, actually provided to the consumer is compared to the amount of the "lender credits" identified in § 1026.37(g)(6)(ii). The total amount of lender credits actually provided to the consumer is determined by aggregating the amount of the "lender credits" identified in § 1026.38(h)(3) with the amounts paid by the creditor that are attributable to a specific loan cost or other cost, disclosed pursuant to § 1026.38(f) and (g).
