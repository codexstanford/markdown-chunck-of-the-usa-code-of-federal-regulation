##### Income data-non-natural person.,e.g.,

7.A financial institution reports that the requirement is not applicable when the applicant or co-applicant is not a natural person (a corporation, partnership, or trust). For example, for a transaction involving a trust, a financial institution reports that the requirement to report income data is not applicable if the trust is the applicant. On the other hand, if the applicant is a natural person, and is the beneficiary of a trust, a financial institution is required to report the information described in § 1003.4(a)(10)(iii).
