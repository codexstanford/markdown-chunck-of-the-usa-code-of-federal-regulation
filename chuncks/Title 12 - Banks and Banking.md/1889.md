(2)An eligible bank's application is deemed approved by the OCC 15 days after the date the OCC receives the application described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the application has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under ยง 5.13(a)(2). An eligible bank seeking to decrease its capital may request OCC approval for up to four consecutive quarters.

An eligible bank may decrease its capital pursuant to such a plan only if the bank maintains its eligible bank status before and after each decrease in its capital.
