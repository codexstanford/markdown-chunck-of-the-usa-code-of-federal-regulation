######## Calculating the maturity of exposures.

(4)(i) If the remaining maturity of the exposure or the longest-dated contract in the netting set is greater than one year, the FDIC-supervised institution must set M for the exposure or netting set equal to the lower of five years or M(EPE), where:

(ii) If the remaining maturity of the exposure or the longest-dated contract in the netting set is one year or less, the FDIC-supervised institution must set M for the exposure or netting set equal to one year, except as provided in ยง 324.131(d)(7).

(iii) Alternatively, an FDIC-supervised institution that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment may use the effective credit duration estimated by the model as M(EPE) in place of the formula in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
