##### Reloadable.

1.A card, code, or other device is "reloadable" if the terms and conditions of the agreement permit funds to be added to the card, code, or other device after the initial purchase or issuance. A card, code, or other device is not "reloadable" merely because the issuer or processor is technically able to add functionality that would otherwise enable the card, code, or other device to be reloaded.
