#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Payments corresponding to interest rates.

1.Creditors must disclose the periodic payment that corresponds to each interest rate disclosed under § 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(A)-(C). The corresponding periodic payment is the regular payment for each such interest rate, without regard to any final payment that differs from others because of the rounding of periodic payments to account for payment amounts including fractions of cents. Balloon payments, however, must be disclosed as provided in § 1026.18(s)(5).
