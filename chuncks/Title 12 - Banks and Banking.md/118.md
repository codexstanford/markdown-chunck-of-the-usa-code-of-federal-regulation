(1) The following transactions are cleared transactions:

(i) A transaction between a CCP and a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member of the CCP where the national bank or Federal savings association enters into the transaction with the CCP for the national bank's or Federal savings association's own account;

(ii) A transaction between a CCP and a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member of the CCP where the national bank or Federal savings association is acting as a financial intermediary on behalf of a clearing member client and the transaction offsets another transaction that satisfies the requirements set forth in ยง 3.3(a);

(iii) A transaction between a clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association and a clearing member where the clearing member acts as a financial intermediary on behalf of the clearing member client and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP, provided that the requirements set forth in ยง 3.3(a) are met; or

(iv) A transaction between a clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association and a CCP where a clearing member guarantees the performance of the clearing member client national bank or Federal savings association to the CCP and the transaction meets the requirements of ยง 3.3(a)(2) and (3).

(2) The exposure of a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member to its clearing member client is not a cleared transaction where the national bank or Federal savings association is either acting as a financial intermediary and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP or where the national bank or Federal savings association provides a guarantee to the CCP on the performance of the client.
