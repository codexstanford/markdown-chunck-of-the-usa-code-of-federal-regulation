###### When disclosures must be more conspicuous.

1.The following rules apply to the requirement that the terms "annual percentage rate" (except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance with § 226.47) and "finance charge" be shown more conspicuously:

- The terms must be more conspicuous only in relation to the other required disclosures under § 226.18. For example, when the disclosures are included on the contract document, those two terms need not be more conspicuous as compared to the heading on the contract document or information required by state law.

- The terms need not be more conspicuous except as part of the finance charge and annual percentage rate disclosures under § 226.18 (d) and (e), although they may, at the creditor's option, be highlighted wherever used in the required disclosures. For example, the terms may, but need not, be highlighted when used in disclosing a prepayment penalty under § 226.18(k) or a required deposit under § 226.18(r).

- The creditor's identity under § 226.18(a) may, but need not, be more prominently displayed than the finance charge and annual percentage rate.

- The terms need not be more conspicuous than figures (including, for example, numbers, percentages, and dollar signs).
