###### § 223.21 What valuation and timing principles apply to credit transactions?
####### Credit transactions by a member bank with a nonaffiliate that becomes an affiliate of the member bank,In general.

(2)-(i)A credit transaction with a nonaffiliate becomes a covered transaction at the time that the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate of the member bank. The member bank must treat the amount of any such credit transaction as part of the aggregate amount of the member bank's covered transactions for purposes of determining compliance with the quantitative limits of §§ 223.11 and 223.12 in connection with any future covered transactions. Except as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the member bank is not required to reduce the amount of its covered transactions with any affiliate because the nonaffiliate has become an affiliate. If the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate less than one year after the member bank enters into the credit transaction with the nonaffiliate, the member bank also must ensure that the credit transaction complies with the collateral requirements of § 223.14 promptly after the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate.
