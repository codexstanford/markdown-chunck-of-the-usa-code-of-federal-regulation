####### The SFA risk-based capital requirement.

(c)(1) If Kis greater than or equal to L + T, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement equals the exposure amount.

(2) If Kis less than or equal to L, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:

(i) F &#xB7; T (where F is 0.016 for all securitization exposures); or

(ii) S[L + T]-S[L].

(3) If Kis greater than L and less than L + T, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to an amount equal to UE &#xB7; TP (K-L), and the exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:

(i) F &#xB7; (T-(K-L)) (where F is 0.016 for all other securitization exposures); or

(ii) S[L + T]-S[K].
