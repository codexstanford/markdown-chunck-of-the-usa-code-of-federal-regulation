##### ยง 704.2 Definitions.
###### Tier 2 capital

means the sum of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this definition:

(1) Nonperpetual capital accounts, as amortized under ยง 704.3(b)(3);

(2) Allowance for loan and lease losses calculated under GAAP to a maximum of 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets;

(3) Any PCC deducted from Tier 1 capital; and

(4) Forty-five percent of unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Unrealized gains are unrealized holding gains, net of unrealized holding losses, calculated as the amount, if any, by which fair value exceeds historical cost. NCUA may disallow such inclusion in the calculation of Tier 2 capital if NCUA determines that the securities are not prudently valued.
