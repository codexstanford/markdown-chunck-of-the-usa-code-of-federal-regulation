#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Interest rate.

iii.If the permanent financing has an adjustable rate at consummation and separate disclosures are provided, the rate disclosed for the permanent financing is the fully-indexed rate pursuant to § 1026.37(b)(2) and its commentary. If the permanent financing has a fixed rate that will not be adjusted when the construction phase converts to the permanent phase, that fixed rate is used for disclosure purposes. If the permanent financing has a rate that may adjust when the construction phase converts to the permanent phase, the permanent financing has an adjustable rate. If the legal obligation for a loan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling provides that the permanent financing interest rate may adjust when the construction financing converts to permanent financing, and such adjustment to the interest rate results in a corresponding adjustment to the payment, the creditor provides the disclosures pursuant to § 1026.20(c), but not (d), if the interest rate for the permanent phase will be fixed after the conversion.
