##### Creditworthiness and other factors.

2.If the rate will depend, at least in part, on a later determination of the consumer's creditworthiness or other factors, the disclosure must include a statement that the rate for which the consumer may qualify at approval will depend on the consumer's creditworthiness and other factors. The creditor may, but is not required to, specify any additional factors that it will use to determine the interest rate. For example, if the creditor will determine the interest rate based on information in the consumer's or cosigner's credit report and the type of school the consumer attends, the creditor may state, "Your interest rate will be based on your credit history and other factors (cosigner credit and school type)."
