###### § 1261.6 Determination of member votes.
####### Voting preferences.

(c)If the board of directors of a Bank includes any voting preferences as part of its approved capital plan, those preferences shall supersede the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section that otherwise would allow a member to cast one vote for each share of Bank stock it was required to hold as of the record date. If a Bank establishes a voting preference for a class of stock, the members with voting rights shall remain subject to the provisions of section 7(b) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1427(b)) that prohibit any member from casting any vote in excess of the average number of shares of stock required to be held by all members in its state.
