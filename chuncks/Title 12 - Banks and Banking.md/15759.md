We place certain limitations on withdrawals in cash. In general, $100 of a deposit is available for withdrawal in cash on the first business day after the day of deposit. In addition, a total of $400 of other funds becoming available on a given day is available for withdrawal in cash at or after () on that day. Any remaining funds will be available for withdrawal in cash on the following business day.

If we receive a deposit to your account on or before the tenth of the month, you begin earning interest on the deposit (whether it was a deposit of cash or checks) as of the first day of that month. If we receive the deposit after the tenth of the month, you begin earning interest on the deposit as of the first of the following month. For example, a deposit made on June 7 earns interest from June l, while a deposit made on June 17 earns interest from July 1.
