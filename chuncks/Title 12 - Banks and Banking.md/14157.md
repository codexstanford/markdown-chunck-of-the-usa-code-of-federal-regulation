###### Disclosure required.

1.The creditor must inform the consumer of the existence of a required deposit. (appendix H provides a model clause that may be used in making that disclosure.) Footnote 45 describes 3 types of deposits that need not be considered required deposits. Use of the phrase "need not" permits creditors to include the disclosure even in cases where there is doubt as to whether the deposit constitutes a required deposit.
