2.Section 226.55(c) applies to amounts owed for a category of transactions to which an increased annual percentage rate or an increased fee or charge cannot be applied after the rate, fee, or charge for that category of transactions has been increased pursuant to ยง 226.55(b)(3). Because ยง 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under ยง 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) during the first year after account opening, ยง 226.55(c) does not apply to balances during the first year after account opening.
