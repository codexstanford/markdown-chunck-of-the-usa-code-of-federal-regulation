##### Definition.

1.Debt cancellation coverage provides for payment or satisfaction of all or part of a debt when a specified event occurs. The term "debt cancellation coverage" includes guaranteed automobile protection, or "GAP," agreements, which pay or satisfy the remaining debt after property insurance benefits are exhausted. Debt suspension coverage provides for suspension of the obligation to make one or more payments on the date(s) otherwise required by the credit agreement, when a specified event occurs. The term "debt suspension" does not include loan payment deferral arrangements in which the triggering event is the bank's unilateral decision to allow a deferral of payment and the borrower's unilateral election to do so, such as by skipping or reducing one or more payments ("skip payments").
