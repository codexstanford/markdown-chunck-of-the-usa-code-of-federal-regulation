##### Appendix F to Part 229 - Official Board Interpretations; Preemption Determinations
###### Permanent schedule.

Regulation CC provides that, as of September 1, 1990, nonlocal checks must be made available for withdrawal by the fifth business day after the banking day of deposit. Under the permanent schedule in the California regulations, a depositary bank with a four-digit routing symbol of 1210 or of 1220 that receives for deposit a check drawn on a nonlocal, in-state commercial bank or foreign bank branch must make the funds available for withdrawal by the fourth business day after the day of deposit. These state schedules provide for shorter hold periods than and thus supersede the federal schedules.
