##### RESPA transactions.

4.The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requires creditors to provide a good faith estimate of closing costs and a settlement statement listing the amounts paid by the consumer. Reverse mortgages subject to RESPA and § 1026.18 are exempt from the requirements of § 1026.18(c) if the creditor complies with RESPA's requirements for a good faith estimate and settlement statement. The itemization of the amount financed need not be given, even though the content and timing of the good faith estimate and settlement statement under RESPA differ from the requirements of §§ 1026.18(c) and 1026.19(a)(2). If a creditor chooses to substitute RESPA's settlement statement for the itemization when redisclosure is required under § 1026.19(a)(2), the statement must be delivered to the consumer at or prior to consummation. The disclosures required by §§ 1026.18(c) and 1026.19(a)(2) may appear on the same page or on the same document as the good faith estimate or the settlement statement, so long as the requirements of § 1026.17(a) are met.
