###### Periodic dividend payments.

3.A credit union can pay dividends each day on the account and still make uniform dividend payments. For example, for a one-year term share account, a credit union could make monthly dividend payments that are equal toof the amount of dividends that will be earned for a 365-day period (or 11 uniform monthly payments-each equal to roughlyof the total amount of dividends-and one payment that accounts to the remainder of the total amount of dividends earned for the period).
