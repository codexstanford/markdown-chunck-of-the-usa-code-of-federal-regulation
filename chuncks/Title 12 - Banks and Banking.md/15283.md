###### Amount of credit.

1.Creditors should compute the total annual loan cost rates for transactions involving discretionary cash advances by assuming that 50 percent of the initial amount of the credit available under the transaction is advanced at closing or, in an open-end transaction, when the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. (For the purposes of this assumption, the initial amount of the credit is the principal loan amount less any costs to the consumer under section 226.33(c)(1).)
