##### First five years after consummation.

1.A "standard mortgage" must have an interest rate that is fixed for at least the first five years (60 months) after consummation. For example, assume an adjustable-rate mortgage that applies the same fixed interest rate to determine the first 60 payments of principal and interest due. The loan is consummated on August 15, 2013, and the first monthly payment is due on October 1, 2013. The date that is five years after consummation is August 15, 2018. The first interest rate adjustment occurs on September 1, 2018. This loan meets the criterion for a "standard mortgage" under § 1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(D) because the interest rate is fixed until September 1, 2018, which is more than five years after consummation. For guidance regarding step-rate mortgages, see comment 43(e)(2)(iv)-3.iii.
