For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If you make a deposit before () on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after () or on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day we are open.

Our policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits available to you on the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. Electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once they are available, you can withdraw the funds in cash and we will use the funds to pay checks that you have written.
