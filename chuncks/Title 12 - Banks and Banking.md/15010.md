###### Penalty rate increase.

B.Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 is received on August 30. At this time, ยง 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to increase the annual percentage rates that apply to the $1,000 purchase balance, the $200 purchase, or the $100 purchase. Instead, those rates can only be increased as discussed in paragraph iii.A. above. However, if the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to ยง 226.9(c) or (g) on September 1, ยง 226.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to apply an increased rate (such as the 17% purchase rate or the 30% penalty rate) to transactions that occur on or after September 16 beginning on October 16.
