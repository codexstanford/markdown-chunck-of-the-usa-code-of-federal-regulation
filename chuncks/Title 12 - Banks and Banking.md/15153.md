###### Agreement used for multiple small private label plans.,i.e.,

5.The private label exception applies even if the same agreement is used for more than one private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts. For example, a card issuer has 15,000 total open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 7,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A, 5,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B, and 3,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant C. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for all three types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of account. The card issuer is not required to submit the agreement to the Board under ยง 226.58(c)(1). The agreement is used for three different private label credit card plans (the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A, the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B, and the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant C), each of which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts, and the card issuer does not offer the agreement for any other type of account. The agreement therefore qualifies for the private label credit card exception under ยง 226.58(c)(6).
