6.The creditor may design a disclosure statement that can be used for more than one type of transaction, so long as the required disclosures for individual transactions are clear and conspicuous. (See the commentary to Appendices G and H for a discussion of the treatment of disclosures that do not apply to specific transactions.) Any disclosure listed in § 1026.18 (except the itemization of the amount financed under § 1026.18(c) for transactions other than private education loans) may be included on a standard disclosure statement even though not all of the creditor's transactions include those features. For example, the statement may include:

i. The variable rate disclosure under § 1026.18(f).

ii. The demand feature disclosure under § 1026.18(i).

iii. A reference to the possibility of a security interest arising from a spreader clause, under § 1026.18(m).

iv. The assumption policy disclosure under § 1026.18(q).

v. The required deposit disclosure under § 1026.18(r).
