##### Requirements.

1.The creditor or other person may collect from the consumer any information that it requires prior to providing the early disclosures before or at the same time as collecting the information listed in § 1026.2(a)(3)(ii). However, the creditor or other person is not permitted to require, before providing the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), that the consumer submit documentation to verify the information collected from the consumer. See also § 1026.2(a)(3) and the related commentary regarding the definition of application. To illustrate:

i. A creditor may ask for the sale price and address of the property, but the creditor may not require the consumer to provide a purchase and sale agreement to support the information the consumer provides orally before the creditor provides the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i).

ii. A mortgage broker may ask for the names, account numbers, and balances of the consumer's checking and savings accounts, but the mortgage broker may not require the consumer to provide bank statements, or similar documentation, to support the information the consumer provides orally before the mortgage broker provides the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i).
