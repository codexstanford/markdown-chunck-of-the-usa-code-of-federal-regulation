##### Terms of less than 24 months.

ii.For product types and features that have introductory periods or adjustment periods that do not equate to a number of whole years, if the period is less than 24 months, § 1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the number of months, followed by the designation "mo." For example, if the product type is an adjustable rate with an 18-month introductory period that adjusts every 18 months starting in the 19th month, the required disclosure would be "18 mo./18mo. Adjustable Rate."
