#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Combined construction-permanent disclosure.

B.If a single, combined construction-permanent disclosure is provided, the time period of the "Interest Only" feature that is disclosed as part of the product disclosure under §§ 1026.37(a)(10) and 1026.38(a)(5)(iii) is the full term of the interest-only construction financing plus any interest-only period for the permanent financing. For example, the product disclosure for a single disclosure, fixed rate, construction-permanent loan with a 12 month interest-only construction phase where the interest rate is not subject to modification upon conversion to the permanent phase is "1 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate." If the first year of the permanent phase in this example also has a 12 month interest-only period, the product disclosure is "2 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate."
