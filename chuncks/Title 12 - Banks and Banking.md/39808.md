### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Spreader clause.

5.The fact that collateral for pre-existing credit with the institution is being used to secure the present obligation constitutes a security interest and must be disclosed. (Such security interests may be known as "spreader" or "dragnet" clauses, or as "cross-collateralization" clauses.) A specific identification of that collateral is unnecessary but a reminder of the interest arising from the prior indebtedness is required. The disclosure may be made by using language such as "collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan." At the creditor's option, a more specific description of the property involved may be given.
