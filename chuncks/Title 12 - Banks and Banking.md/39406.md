2.i.When applying the methods listed in § 1026.55(c)(2) pursuant to § 1026.9(h)(2)(iii), the provisions in § 1026.55(c)(2) and the guidance in the commentary to § 1026.55(c)(2) regarding protected balances also apply to a balance on the account subject to § 1026.9(h)(2)(iii). If a creditor terminates or suspends credit availability based on a consumer's rejection of a significant change in terms, the balance on the account that is subject to § 1026.9(h)(2)(iii) is the balance at the end of the day on which credit availability is terminated or suspended. However, if a creditor does not terminate or suspend credit availability based on the consumer's rejection, the balance on the account subject to § 1026.9(h)(2)(iii) is the balance at the end of the day on which the creditor was notified of the rejection or, at the creditor's option, a later date.
