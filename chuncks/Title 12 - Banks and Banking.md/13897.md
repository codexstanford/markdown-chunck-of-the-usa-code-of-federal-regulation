###### Rounding.

2.The regulation does not require that the annual percentage rate be calculated to any particular number of decimal places; rounding is permissible within theth of 1 percent tolerance. For example, an exact annual percentage rate of 14.33333% may be stated as 14.33% or as 14.3%, or even as 14%; but it could not be stated as 14.2% or 14%, since each varies by more than the permitted tolerance.
