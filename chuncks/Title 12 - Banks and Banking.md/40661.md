#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Introductory period not yet known.

B.If the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period that is not yet known at the time of delivery of the Loan Estimate, the creditor should disclose the shortest potential introductory period for the particular loan product offered. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period that may be between 36 and 48 months and the rate would then adjust every year, the disclosure required by § 1026.37(a)(10) is "3/1 Adjustable Rate."
