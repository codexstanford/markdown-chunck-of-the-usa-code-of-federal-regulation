####### Tier 2 Capital.

(d)Tier 2 capital is the sum of tier 2 capital elements and any related surplus, minus regulatory adjustments and deductions in § 324.22. Tier 2 capital elements are:

(1) Instruments (plus related surplus) that meet the following criteria:

(i) The instrument is issued and paid-in;

(ii) The instrument is subordinated to depositors and general creditors of the FDIC-supervised institution;

(iii) The instrument is not secured, not covered by a guarantee of the FDIC-supervised institution or of an affiliate of the FDIC-supervised institution, and not subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the instrument in relation to more senior claims;

(iv) The instrument has a minimum original maturity of at least five years. At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of the instrument, the amount that is eligible to be included in tier 2 capital is reduced by 20 percent of the original amount of the instrument (net of redemptions) and is excluded from regulatory capital when the remaining maturity is less than one year. In addition, the instrument must not have any terms or features that require, or create significant incentives for, the FDIC-supervised institution to redeem the instrument prior to maturity;and

(v) The instrument, by its terms, may be called by the FDIC-supervised institution only after a minimum of five years following issuance, except that the terms of the instrument may allow it to be called sooner upon the occurrence of an event that would preclude the instrument from being included in tier 2 capital, a tax event, or if the issuing entity is required to register as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act. In addition:

(A) The FDIC-supervised institution must receive the prior approval of the FDIC to exercise a call option on the instrument.

(B) The FDIC-supervised institution does not create at issuance, through action or communication, an expectation the call option will be exercised.

(C) Prior to exercising the call option, or immediately thereafter, the FDIC-supervised institution must either: Replace any amount called with an equivalent amount of an instrument that meets the criteria for regulatory capital under this section;or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC that following redemption, the FDIC-supervised institution would continue to hold an amount of capital that is commensurate with its risk.

(vi) The holder of the instrument must have no contractual right to accelerate payment of principal or interest on the instrument, except in the event of a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding of the FDIC-supervised institution.

(vii) The instrument has no credit-sensitive feature, such as a dividend or interest rate that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the FDIC-supervised institution's credit standing, but may have a dividend rate that is adjusted periodically independent of the FDIC-supervised institution's credit standing, in relation to general market interest rates or similar adjustments.

(viii) The FDIC-supervised institution, or an entity that the FDIC-supervised institution controls, has not purchased and has not directly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument.

(ix) If the instrument is not issued directly by the FDIC-supervised institution or by a subsidiary of the FDIC-supervised institution that is an operating entity, the only asset of the issuing entity is its investment in the capital of the FDIC-supervised institution, and proceeds must be immediately available without limitation to the FDIC-supervised institution or the FDIC-supervised institution's top-tier holding company in a form that meets or exceeds all the other criteria for tier 2 capital instruments under this section.

(x) Redemption of the instrument prior to maturity or repurchase requires the prior approval of the FDIC.

(xi) For an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution, the governing agreement, offering circular, or prospectus of an instrument issued after the date on which the advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution becomes subject to this part under § 324.1(f) must disclose that the holders of the instrument may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the FDIC-supervised institution enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.

(2) Total capital minority interest, subject to the limitations set forth in § 324.21, that is not included in the FDIC-supervised institution's tier 1 capital.

(3) ALLL or AACL, as applicable, up to 1.25 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's standardized total risk-weighted assets not including any amount of the ALLL or AACL, as applicable (and excluding in the case of a market risk FDIC-supervised institution, its standardized market risk-weighted assets).

(4)(i) Any instrument that qualified as tier 2 capital under the FDIC's general risk-based capital rules under 12 CFR part 325, appendix A (state nonmember banks) and 12 CFR part 390, appendix Z (state saving associations) as then in effect, that were issued under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010,or prior to October 4, 2010, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

(ii) Any debt instruments issued under the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Emergency Capital Investment Program pursuant to section 104A of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.

(5) For an FDIC-supervised institution that makes an AOCI opt-out election (as defined in § 324.22(b)(2), 45 percent of pretax net unrealized gains on available-for-sale preferred stock classified as an equity security under GAAP and available-for-sale equity exposures.

(6) Notwithstanding the criteria for tier 2 capital instruments referenced above, an instrument with terms that provide that the instrument may be called earlier than five years upon the occurrence of a rating agency event does not violate the criterion in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section provided that the instrument was issued and included in an FDIC-supervised institution's tier 1 or tier 2 capital prior to January 1, 2014, and that such instrument satisfies all other criteria under this paragraph (d).
