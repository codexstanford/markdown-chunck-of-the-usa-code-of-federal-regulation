##### Adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory fixed rate.

1.Under § 1026.43(d)(1)(i)(A), an adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory fixed interest rate for one year or longer is considered a "non-standard mortgage." For example, a covered transaction that has a fixed introductory rate for the first two, three, or five years and then converts to a variable rate for the remaining 28, 27, or 25 years, respectively, is a "non-standard mortgage." A covered transaction with an introductory rate for six months that then converts to a variable rate for the remaining 29 and one-half years is not a "non-standard mortgage."
