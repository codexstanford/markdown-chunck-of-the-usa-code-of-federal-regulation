###### Exceptions to the availability schedules.

The Rhode Island law contains exceptions for reason to doubt collectibility or ability of the depositor to reimburse the depositary bank, for new accounts, for large checks, and for foreign checks. In all cases where the federal availability schedule preempts the state schedule, only the federal exceptions will apply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule, the state exceptions may be used to extend the state availability schedule to meet the federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held up to the federal availability schedule limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold under any federal exception that can be applied to the deposit. Thus, if the state and federal availability schedules are the same for a particular deposit, both a state and a federal exception must be applicable to that deposit in order to extend the hold beyond the schedule. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customer, in accordance with ยง 229.13(g) of Regulation CC.
