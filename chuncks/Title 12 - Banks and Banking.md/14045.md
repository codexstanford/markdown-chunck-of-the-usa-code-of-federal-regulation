1.Section 226.17(c)(3) allows creditors to disregard certain factors in calculating and making disclosures. For example:

- Creditors may ignore the effects of collecting payments in whole cents. Because payments cannot be collected in fractional cents, it is often difficult to amortize exactly an obligation with equal payments; the amount of the last payment may require adjustment to account for the rounding of the other payments to whole cents.

- Creditors may base their disclosures on calculation tools that assume that all months have an equal number of days, even if their practice is to take account of the variations in months for purposes of collecting interest. For example, a creditor may use a calculation tool based on a 360-day year, when it in fact collects interest by applying a factor ofof the annual rate to 365 days. This rule does not, however, authorize creditors to ignore, for disclosure purposes, the effects of applyingof an annual rate to 365 days.
