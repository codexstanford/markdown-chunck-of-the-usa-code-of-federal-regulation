###### Addition of a security interest.

5.Under footnote 47, the addition of a security interest in a consumer's principal dwelling to an existing obligation is rescindable even if the existing obligation is not satisfied and replaced by a new obligation, and even if the existing obligation was previously exempt under ยง 226.3(b). The right of rescission applies only to the added security interest, however, and not to the original obligation. In those situations, only the ยง 226.23(b) notice need be delivered, not new material disclosures; the rescission period will begin to run from the delivery of the notice.
