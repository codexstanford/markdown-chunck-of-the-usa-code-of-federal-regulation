##### Subpart A-Regulations That Apply to Both Federal Credit Unions and Federally Insured State-Chartered Credit Unions and That Are Not Codified Elsewhere in NCUA's Regulations
###### ยง 741.3 Criteria.
####### Insurance of member accounts would not otherwise involve undue risk to the NCUSIF.

(d)The credit union must maintain adequate fidelity bond coverage as specified in ยง 741.201. Any circumstances which may be unique to the particular credit union concerned shall also be considered in arriving at the determination of whether or not an undue risk to the NCUSIF is or may be present. For purposes of this section, the term "undue risk to the NCUSIF" is defined as a condition which creates a probability of loss in excess of that normally found in a credit union and which indicates a reasonably foreseeable probability of the credit union becoming insolvent because of such condition, with a resultant claim against the NCUSIF.
