#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Extent of termination.

2.The creditor's security interest is void to the extent that it is related to the occurrence giving rise to the right of rescission. For example, upon rescission:

i. If the consumer's right to rescind is activated by the opening of a plan, any security interest in the principal dwelling is void.

ii. If the right arises due to an increase in the credit limit, the security interest is void as to the amount of credit extensions over the prior limit, but the security interest in amounts up to the original credit limit is unaffected.

iii. If the right arises with each individual credit extension, then the interest is void as to that extension, and other extensions are unaffected.
