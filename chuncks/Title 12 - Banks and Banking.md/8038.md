###### Internal audit system.

B.An institution should have an internal audit system that is appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities and that provides for:

1. Adequate monitoring of the system of internal controls through an internal audit function. For an institution whose size, complexity or scope of operations does not warrant a full scale internal audit function, a system of independent reviews of key internal controls may be used;

2. Independence and objectivity;

3. Qualified persons;

4. Adequate testing and review of information systems;

5. Adequate documentation of tests and findings and any corrective actions;

6. Verification and review of management actions to address material weaknesses; and

7. Review by the institution's audit committee or board of directors of the effectiveness of the internal audit systems.
