#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Fees "imposed by" a person.

5.For purposes of § 1026.19(e), a fee is "imposed by" a person if the person requires a consumer to provide a method for payment, even if the payment is not made at that time. For example, if a creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a $500 check to pay for a "processing fee" before the consumer receives the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor or other person does not comply with § 1026.19(e)(2)(i), even if the creditor or other person had stated that the check will not be cashed until after the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the consumer and waited until after the consumer subsequently indicated an intent to proceed to cash the check. Similarly, a creditor or other person does not comply with the requirements of § 1026.19(e)(2)(i) if the creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a credit card number before the consumer receives the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), even if the creditor or other person had promised not to charge the consumer's credit card for the $500 processing fee until after the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the consumer and waited until after the consumer subsequently indicated an intent to proceed. In contrast, a creditor or other person complies with § 1026.19(e)(2)(i) if the creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a credit card number before the consumer receives the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and subsequently indicates an intent to proceed, provided that the consumer's authorization is only to pay for the cost of a credit report and the creditor or other person only charges a reasonable and bona fide fee for obtaining the consumer's credit report. This is so even if the creditor or other person maintains the consumer's credit card number on file and charges the consumer a $500 processing fee after the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received and the consumer subsequently indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures, provided that the creditor or other person requested and received a separate authorization from the consumer for the processing fee after the consumer received the disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicated an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.
