## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection

#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Same specified terms and conditions regardless of whether credit is accessed by the prepaid card or the traditional credit card.,1,1,5,2

3.To satisfy the condition of § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D)(), the credit card account must be a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that a consumer can access through a traditional credit card. As explained in comment 61(a)(5)(iii)(D)()-1, for purposes of § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D), "traditional credit card" means a credit card that is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card. For the exception in § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D) to apply, under § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D)(), a card issuer must not vary the specified terms and conditions on the credit card account when a consumer authorizes linking the account with the prepaid card as described in § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii)(D)() depending on whether a particular credit extension from the credit card account is accessed by the prepaid card or by the traditional credit card.
