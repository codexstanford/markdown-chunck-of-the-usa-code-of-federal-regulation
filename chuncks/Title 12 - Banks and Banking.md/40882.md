### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Disclosures not applicable.

1.Where a disclosure is not applicable to a particular transaction, form H-25 of appendix H to this part may not be modified to state "not applicable" or "N/A." The portion of the form pertaining to the inapplicable disclosure may be left blank unless otherwise provided by § 1026.38. For example, the disclosure required by § 1026.38(r) of the consumer's or seller's real estate broker may be left blank for a transaction that does not involve real estate brokers, such as a refinance or home equity loan. As provided in § 1026.38(m) and (n), however, the adjustable payment and adjustable interest rate tables required by those paragraphs may be included only if those disclosures are applicable to the transaction and otherwise must be excluded.
