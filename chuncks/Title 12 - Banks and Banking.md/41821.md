## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### 14-day rule in § 1026.55(b)(3)(ii).

i.Although § 1026.55(b)(3)(ii) permits a card issuer that discloses an increased rate pursuant to § 1026.9(c) or (g) to apply that rate to transactions that occur more than 14 days after provision of the notice, the card issuer cannot begin to accrue interest at the increased rate until that increase goes into effect, consistent with § 1026.9(c) or (g). For example, if on May 1 a card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 1026.9(c) stating that a rate will increase from 15% to 18% on June 15, § 1026.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to transactions that occur on or after May 16. However, neither § 1026.55 nor § 1026.9(c) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 18% rate on those transactions until June 15. See additional examples in comment 55(b)(3)-4.
