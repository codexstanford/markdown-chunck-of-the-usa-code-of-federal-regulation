##### Transfer three years after consummation.

1.Under § 1026.43(f)(2)(i), if a balloon-payment qualified mortgage under § 1026.43(f)(1) is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred three years or more after consummation, the balloon-payment qualified mortgage retains its status as a qualified mortgage under § 1026.43(f)(1) following the sale. The transferee need not be eligible to originate qualified mortgages under § 1026.43(f)(1)(vi). The balloon-payment qualified mortgage will continue to be a qualified mortgage throughout its life, and the transferee, and any subsequent transferees, may invoke the presumption of compliance for qualified mortgages under § 1026.43(f)(1).
