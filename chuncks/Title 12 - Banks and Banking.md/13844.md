###### Security interest-after-acquired property.

2.As used in ยง 226.12(d)(2), the term "security interest" does not exclude (as it does for other Regulation Z purposes) interests in after-acquired property. Thus, a consensual security interest in deposit-account funds, including funds deposited after the granting of the security interest would constitute a permissible exception to the prohibition on offsets.
