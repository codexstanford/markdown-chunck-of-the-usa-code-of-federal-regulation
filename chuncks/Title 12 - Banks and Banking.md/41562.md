### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### See,e.g.,

i. First, the creditor must determine the "tier" into which the loan falls based on the loan amount. The loan amount is the principal amount the consumer will borrow, as reflected in the promissory note or loan contract.§ 1026.43(b)(5). For example, if the loan amount is $55,000, the loan falls into the tier for loans greater than or equal to $20,000 but less than $60,000, to which a 5 percent cap on points and fees applies. For tiers with a prescribed dollar limit on points and fees (for loans from $60,000 up to $100,000, the limit is $3,000), the creditor does not need to do any further calculations.

ii. Second, for tiers with a percentage limit, the creditor must determine the total loan amount based on the calculation for the total loan amount under comment 32(b)(4)(i)-1. If the loan amount is $55,000, for example, the total loan amount may be a different amount, such as $52,000.

iii. Third, the creditor must apply the percentage cap on points and fees to the total loan amount. For example, for a loan of $55,000 where the total loan amount is $52,000, the allowable points and fees are 5 percent of $52,000, or $2,600.
