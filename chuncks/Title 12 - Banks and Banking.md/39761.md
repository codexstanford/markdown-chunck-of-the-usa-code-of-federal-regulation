#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Prepaid mortgage insurance premiums.

2.Regulation X under RESPA, 12 CFR 1024.8, requires creditors to give consumers a settlement statement disclosing the costs associated with reverse mortgage loan transactions. Included on the settlement statement are mortgage insurance premiums collected at settlement, which are prepaid finance charges. In calculating the total amount of prepaid finance charges, creditors should use the amount for mortgage insurance listed on the line for mortgage insurance on the settlement statement (line 1003 on HUD-1 or HUD 1-A), without adjustment, even if the actual amount collected at settlement may vary because of RESPA's escrow accounting rules. Figures for mortgage insurance disclosed in conformance with RESPA shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of Regulation Z.
