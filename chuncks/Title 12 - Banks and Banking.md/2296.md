## Chapter I - Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury
### PART 7 - ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS
#### Subpart A - National Bank and Federal Savings Association Powers
##### ยง 7.1022 National banks' authority to buy and sell exchange, coin, and bullion.
###### Nonconforming holdings.

(e)National banks that hold industrial or commercial metal as a result of dealing or investing in that metal must dispose of such metal as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from April 1, 2018. The OCC may grant up to four separate one-year extensions to dispose of industrial or commercial metal if a national bank makes a good faith effort to dispose of the metal and retention of the metal for an additional year is not inconsistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.
