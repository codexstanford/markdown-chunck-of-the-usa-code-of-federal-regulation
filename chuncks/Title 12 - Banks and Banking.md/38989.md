#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Pre-existing insurance policy.

1.The insurance discussed in § 1026.4(b)(7) and (b)(8) does not include an insurance policy (such as a life or an automobile collision insurance policy) that is already owned by the consumer, even if the policy is assigned to or otherwise made payable to the creditor to satisfy an insurance requirement. Such a policy is not "written in connection with" the transaction, as long as the insurance was not purchased for use in that credit extension, since it was previously owned by the consumer.
