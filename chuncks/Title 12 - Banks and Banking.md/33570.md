#### Supplement I to Part 1003-Official Interpretations
##### Preceding calendar year.

1.Section 1003.3(d)(6) refers to the preceding December 31, which means the December 31 preceding the current calendar year. For example, in 2020, the preceding December 31 is December 31, 2019. Assume that, as of December 31, 2019, an insured depository institution received ratings of "needs to improve record of meeting community credit needs" during its two most recent examinations under section 807(b)(2) of the Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2)) in 2018 and 2014. Accordingly, in 2020, the insured depository institution's transactions are not partially exempt pursuant to § 1003.3(d).
