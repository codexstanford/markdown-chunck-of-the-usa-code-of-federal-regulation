###### ยง 250.143 Member bank purchase of stock of foreign operations subsidiaries.
####### Federal Reserve Bulletin,operations subsidiary

(a) In a previous interpretation, the Board determined that a State member bank would not violate the "stock-purchase prohibition" of section 5136 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24 &#xB6; 7) by purchasing and holding the shares of a corporation which performs "at locations at which the bank is authorized to engage in business, functions that the bank is empowered to perform directly".(1968681, 12 CFR 250.141). The Board of Governors has been asked by a State member bank whether, under that interpretation, the bank may establish such a so-calledoutside the United States.

(b) In the above interpretation the Board viewed the creation of a wholly-owned subsidiary which engaged in activities that the bank itself could perform directly as an alternative organizational arrangement that would be permissible for member banks unless "its use would be inconsistent with other Federal law, either statutory or judicial".

(c) In the Board's judgment, the use by member banks of operations subsidiaries outside the United States would be clearly inconsistent with the statutory scheme of the Federal Reserve Act governing the foreign investments and operations of member banks. It is clear that Congress has given member banks the authority to conduct operations and make investments outside the United States only through gradually adopting a series of specific statutory amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, each of which has been carefully drawn to give the Board approval, supervisory, and regulatory authority over those operations and investments.
