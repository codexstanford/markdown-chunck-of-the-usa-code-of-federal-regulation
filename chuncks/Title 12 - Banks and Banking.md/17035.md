####### Title change.

(1)(i) Subject to ยง 239.13 and this paragraph (b), a mutual holding company may amend its charter by substituting a new corporate title in section 1 of its charter.

(ii) Prior to changing its corporate title, a mutual holding company must file with the Board a written notice indicating the intended change. The Board shall provide to the mutual holding company a timely written acknowledgment stating when the notice was received. If, within 30 days of receipt of notice, the Board does not notify the mutual holding company of its objection to the corporate title change on the grounds that the title misrepresents the nature of the institution or the services it offers, the mutual holding company may change its title by amending its charter in accordance with ยง 239.14(b) or ยง 239.22 and the amendment provisions of its charter.
