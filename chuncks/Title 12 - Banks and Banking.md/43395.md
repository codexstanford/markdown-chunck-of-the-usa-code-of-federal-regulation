###### Additional procedure for depositions by written questions.

(b)(1) Any motion or stipulation seeking a deposition of a witness by written questions must include the written questions the party seeking the deposition will ask the witness. Within seven days after service of the motion and written questions, any party may file objections to such written questions and any party may file cross-questions. When a deposition is taken by written questions, no persons other than the witness, counsel to the witness, the deposition officer, and, if the deposition officer does not act as reporter, a reporter, may be present at the examination of the witness. No party may be present or represented unless otherwise permitted by order. The deposition officer will propound the questions and cross-questions to the witness in the order submitted.

(2) The order for deposition, filing of the deposition, form of the deposition, and use of the deposition in the record will be governed by paragraphs (d) through (l) of this section, except that no cross-examination will be made.
