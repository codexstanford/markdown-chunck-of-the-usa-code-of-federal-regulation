#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### Two fee variations with like fee amounts.

iii.A financial institution offers two methods of check reload for which it charges a fee-depositing checks at an ATM and depositing checks with a teller at the financial institution's branch locations. There is a fee of $0.50 for both methods of check deposit. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from both of these check reload methods during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose this fee type as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because the fee amounts are the same for the two methods of check deposit, if the fee type is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type, the financial institution's options for disclosing this fee type in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) and (b)(3)(iii) include: "Check reload (ATM or teller check dep)" and the fee amount as "$0.50" or "Check reload" and the fee amount as "$0.50".
