#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Periodic principal and interest payments.

1.For purposes of § 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A), periodic principal and interest payments may change when the interest rate, applicable interest rate caps, required periodic principal and interest payments, or ranges of such payments may change. Minor payment variations resulting solely from the fact that months have different numbers of days are not changes to periodic principal and interest payments.
