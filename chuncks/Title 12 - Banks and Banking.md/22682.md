######## Risk-weighted assets using IMM.

(2)Under the IMM, an FDIC-supervised institution uses an internal model to estimate the expected exposure (EE) for a netting set and then calculates EAD based on that EE. An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate two EEs and two EADs (one stressed and one unstressed) for each netting set as follows:

(i) EADis calculated using an EE estimate based on the most recent data meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section;

(ii) EADis calculated using an EE estimate based on a historical period that includes a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the FDIC-supervised institution's counterparties according to paragraph (d)(3)(viii) of this section;

(iii) The FDIC-supervised institution must use its internal model's probability distribution for changes in the fair value of a netting set that are attributable to changes in market variables to determine EE; and

(iv) Under the internal models methodology, EAD = Max (0, &#x3B1; x effective EPE-CVA), or, subject to the prior written approval of FDIC as provided in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, a more conservative measure of EAD.

(A) CVA equals the credit valuation adjustment that the FDIC-supervised institution has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (d), CVA does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the FDIC-supervised institution's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.
