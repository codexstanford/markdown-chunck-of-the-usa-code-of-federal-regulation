### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Statements that the consumer should see details.

3.The provisions of § 1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A), (5)(iii)(A), (7)(iii)(A), and (8)(iii)(A) each require a statement that the consumer should see certain details of the closing costs disclosed under § 1026.38(j). Form H-25 of appendix H to this part contains some examples of these statements. For example, § 1026.38(i)(5)(iii)(A) requires a statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(ii). The following statement, which is similar to that shown on form H-25(B) of appendix H to this part for § 1026.38(i)(7)(iii)(A), "See Deposit in Section L," in which the words "Section L" are in boldface font, complies with this provision. In addition, for example, the statement "See details in Sections K and L," in which the words "Sections K and L" are in boldface font, complies with the requirement under § 1026.38(i)(8)(iii)(A). See form H-25(B) of appendix H to this part for an example of the statement required by § 1026.38(i)(8)(iii)(A). See also comment 38(i)(7)(iii)(A)-1 for additional examples that comply with the requirements under § 1026.38(i)(7)(iii)(A).
