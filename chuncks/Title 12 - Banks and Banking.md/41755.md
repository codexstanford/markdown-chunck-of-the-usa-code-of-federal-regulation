#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes.

C.Same facts as paragraphs A and B above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that-based on past returned payment rates and other factors relevant to potential returned payment rates for year two-it will experience a 2% increase in returned payments during year two (in other words, 3,000 additional returned payments for a total of 153,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect 25% of returned payment fees during year two (in other words, the card issuer will be unable to collect 38,250 fees, leaving a total of 114,750 returned payments for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that-based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of returned payments and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two-it will experience a 1% decrease in costs during year two (in other words, a $31,000 reduction in costs for a total of $3.069 million). For purposes of § 1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $27 returned payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments during year two.
