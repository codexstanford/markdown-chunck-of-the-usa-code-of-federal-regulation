####### Qualitative disclosures.

(d)(1) A covered depository institution holding company or covered nonbank company subject to this subpart must provide a qualitative discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its liquidity coverage ratio, which may include the following:

(i) The main drivers of the liquidity coverage ratio;

(ii) Changes in the liquidity coverage ratio over time and causes of such changes;

(iii) The composition of eligible HQLA;

(iv) Concentration of funding sources;

(v) Derivative exposures and potential collateral calls;

(vi) Currency mismatch in the liquidity coverage ratio; or

(vii) The centralized liquidity management function of the covered depository institution holding company or covered nonbank company and its interaction with other functional areas of the covered depository institution holding company or covered nonbank company.

(2) If a covered depository institution holding company or covered nonbank company subject to this subpart believes that the qualitative discussion required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section would prejudice seriously its position by resulting in public disclosure of specific commercial or financial information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the covered depository institution holding company or covered nonbank company is not required to include those specific items in its qualitative discussion, but must provide more general information about the items that had a significant effect on its liquidity coverage ratio, together with the fact that, and the reason why, more specific information was not discussed.
