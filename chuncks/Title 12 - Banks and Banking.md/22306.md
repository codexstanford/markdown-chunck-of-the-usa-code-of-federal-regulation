###### ยง 324.5 Issuance of directives.
####### Enforcement of a directive.

(d)(1) Whenever an FDIC-supervised institution fails to follow the directive or to submit or adhere to its capital adequacy plan, the FDIC may seek enforcement of the directive in the appropriate United States district court, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3907(b)(2)(B)(ii), in the same manner and to the same extent as if the directive were a final cease-and-desist order. In addition to enforcement of the directive, the FDIC may seek assessment of civil money penalties for violation of the directive against any FDIC-supervised institution, any officer, director, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the FDIC-supervised institution, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3909(d).

(2) The directive may be issued separately, in conjunction with, or in addition to, any other enforcement mechanisms available to the FDIC, including cease-and-desist orders, orders of correction, the approval or denial of applications, or any other actions authorized by law. In addition to addressing an FDIC-supervised institution's minimum leverage capital requirement, the capital directive may also address minimum risk-based capital requirements that are to be maintained and calculated in accordance with ยง 324.10, and, for state savings associations, the minimum tangible capital requirements set for in ยง 324.10.
