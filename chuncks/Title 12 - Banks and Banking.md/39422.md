##### Separate fee to allow consumers to make a payment.

1.For purposes of § 1026.10(e), the term "separate fee" means a fee imposed on a consumer for making a payment to the consumer's account. A fee or other charge imposed if payment is made after the due date, such as a late fee or finance charge, is not a separate fee to allow consumers to make a payment for purposes of § 1026.10(e).
