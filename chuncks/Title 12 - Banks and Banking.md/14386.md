##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### General rule.

1.Under ยง 226.24(d)(1), whenever certain triggering terms appear in credit advertisements, the additional credit terms enumerated in ยง 226.24(d)(2) must also appear. These provisions apply even if the triggering term is not stated explicitly but may be readily determined from the advertisement. For example, an advertisement may state "80 percent financing available," which is in fact indicating that a 20 percent downpayment is required.
