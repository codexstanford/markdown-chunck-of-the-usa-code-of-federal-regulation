####### Reservation of authority.

(h)Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Board retains its authority to require a banking entity without significant trading assets and liabilities to apply any requirements of this part that would otherwise apply if the banking entity had significant or moderate trading assets and liabilities if the Board determines that the size or complexity of the banking entity's trading or investment activities, or the risk of evasion of subpart B or subpart C of this part, does not warrant a presumption of compliance under paragraph (g) of this section or treatment as a banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities, as applicable. The Board's exercise of this reservation of authority must be made in accordance with the notice and response procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.
