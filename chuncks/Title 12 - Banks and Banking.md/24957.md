(ii)The temporary relief provided under this paragraph (q)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to an FDIC-supervised institution if the FDIC determines that permitting the FDIC-supervised institution to determine its assets in accordance with that paragraph would not be commensurate with the risk posed by the institution. When making this determination, the FDIC will consider all relevant factors, including the extent of asset growth of the FDIC-supervised institution since December 31, 2019; the causes of such growth, including whether growth occurred as a result of mergers or acquisitions; whether such growth is likely to be temporary or permanent; whether the FDIC-supervised institution has become involved in any additional activities since December 31, 2019; and the type of assets held by the FDIC-supervised institution.
