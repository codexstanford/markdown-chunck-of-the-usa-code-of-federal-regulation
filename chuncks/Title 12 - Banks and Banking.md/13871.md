###### Right to withhold payment.

2.If the creditor reflects any disputed amount or related finance or other charges on the periodic statement, and is therefore required to make the disclosure under ยง 226.13(d)(4), the creditor may comply with that disclosure requirement by indicating that payment of any disputed amount is not required pending resolution. Making a disclosure that only refers to the disputed amount would, of course, in no way affect the consumer's right under ยง 226.13(d)(1) to withhold related finance and other charges. The disclosure under ยง 226.13(d)(4) need not appear in any specific place on the periodic statement, need not state the specific amount that the consumer may withhold, and may be preprinted on the periodic statement.
