4.A creditor or other person complies with § 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(A) if:

i. A creditor receives a consumer's application directly from the consumer and does not impose any fee, other than a bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report, until the consumer receives the disclosures required under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.

ii. A third party submits a consumer's application to a creditor and neither the creditor nor the third party imposes any fee, other than a bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report, until the consumer receives the disclosures required under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.

iii. A third party submits a consumer's application to a creditor following a different creditor's denial of the consumer's application (or following the consumer's withdrawal of that application), and if a fee already has been assessed for obtaining the credit report, the new creditor or third party does not impose any additional fee until the consumer receives disclosures required under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) from the new creditor and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.
