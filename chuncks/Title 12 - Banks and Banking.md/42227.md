26.This sample illustrates a disclosure required under § 1026.47(a). The sample assumes a range of interest rates between 7.375% and 17.375%. The sample assumes a variable interest rate that will never exceed 25% over the life of the loan. The term of the sample loan is 20 years for an amount up to $20,000 and 30 years for an amount more than $20,000. The repayment options and sample costs have been combined into a single table, as permitted in the commentary to § 1026.47(a)(3). It demonstrates the loan amount, interest rate, and total paid when a consumer makes loan payments while in school, pays only interest while in school, and defers all payments while in school.
