##### Shared responsibilities permitted-completing the disclosures.

4.Creditors and settlement agents may agree to divide responsibility with respect to completing any of the disclosures under § 1026.38 for the disclosures provided under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i). The settlement agent may assume the responsibility to complete some or all of the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f). For example, the creditor complies with the requirements of § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) and the settlement agent complies with the requirements of § 1026.19(f)(1)(v) if the settlement agent agrees to complete only the portion of the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) related to closing costs for taxes, title fees, and insurance premiums, and the creditor agrees to complete the remainder of the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i), and either the settlement agent or the creditor provides the consumer with one single disclosure form containing all of the information required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1026.19(f)(1)(i), in accordance with the other requirements in § 1026.19(f), such as requirements related to timing and delivery.
