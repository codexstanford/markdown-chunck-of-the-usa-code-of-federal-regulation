##### Single application.

9.A card issuer may use a single, common application form or process for all credit card applicants, regardless of age. A card issuer may rely without further verification on income and asset information provided by applicants through such an application, so long as the application questions gather sufficient information to allow the card issuer to satisfy the requirements of both § 1026.51(a) and (b), depending on whether a particular applicant has reached the age of 21. For example, a card issuer might provide two separate line items on its application form, one prompting applicants to provide their "personal income," and the other prompting applicants for "available income." A card issuer might also prompt applicants, regardless of age, using only the term "income" and satisfy the requirements of both § 1026.51(a) and (b).
