####### Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.

(d)(1) The FDIC-supervised institution must have a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution must validate its internal models initially and on an ongoing basis. The FDIC-supervised institution's validation process must be independent of the internal models' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must include:

(i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the internal models;

(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and the comparison of the FDIC-supervised institution's model outputs with relevant internal and external data sources or estimation techniques; and

(iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting. For internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure, this process must include a comparison of the changes in the FDIC-supervised institution's portfolio value that would have occurred were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with VaR-based measures during a sample period not used in model development.

(3) The FDIC-supervised institution must stress test the market risk of its covered positions at a frequency appropriate to each portfolio, and in no case less frequently than quarterly. The stress tests must take into account concentration risk (including but not limited to concentrations in single issuers, industries, sectors, or markets), illiquidity under stressed market conditions, and risks arising from the FDIC-supervised institution's trading activities that may not be adequately captured in its internal models.

(4) The FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the FDIC-supervised institution's market risk measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and independent risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the FDIC-supervised institution's measures for market risk under this subpart. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the FDIC-supervised institution's board of directors (or a committee thereof).
