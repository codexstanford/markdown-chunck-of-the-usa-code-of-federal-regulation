##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Requirement applies only to agreements submitted to the Board.

1.Card issuers are only required to post and maintain on their publicly available Web site the credit card agreements that the card issuer must submit to the Board under § 226.58(c). If, for example, a card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board because the card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 226.58(c)(5), the card issuer is not required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under § 226.58(d). Similarly, if a card issuer is not required to submit a specific agreement to the Board, such as an agreement that qualifies for the private label exception under § 226.58(c)(6), the card issuer is not required to post and maintain that agreement under § 226.58(d) (either on the card issuer's publicly available Web site or on the publicly available Web sites of merchants at which private label credit cards can be used). (The card issuer in both of these cases is still required to provide each individual cardholder with access to his or her specific credit card agreement under § 226.58(e) by posting and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's Web site or by providing a copy of the agreement upon the cardholder's request.)
