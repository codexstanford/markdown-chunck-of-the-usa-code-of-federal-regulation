####### ยง 628.51 Introduction and exposure measurement.
######## General.

(a)(1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to an investment fund, a System institution must use the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) provided in ยง 628.52. A System institution must use the look-through approaches provided in ยง 628.53 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds. Equity investments (including preferred stock investments) in other System institutions, service corporations, and the Funding Corporation do not receive a risk weight, because they are deducted from capital in accordance with ยง 628.22.

(2)-(3) [Reserved]
