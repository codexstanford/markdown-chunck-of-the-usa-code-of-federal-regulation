#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Itemization.

5.Creditors determine the level of itemization of "Origination Charges" that is appropriate under § 1026.37(f)(1) in relation to charges paid by the consumer to the creditor, subject to the limitations in § 1026.37(f)(1)(ii). For example, the following charges should be itemized separately: compensation paid directly by a consumer to a loan originator that is not also the creditor; or a charge imposed to pay for a loan level pricing adjustment assessed on the creditor, which the creditor passes onto the consumer as a charge at consummation and not as an adjustment to the interest rate.
