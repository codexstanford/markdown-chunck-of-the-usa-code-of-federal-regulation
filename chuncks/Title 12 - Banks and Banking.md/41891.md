#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Closed accounts.

1.If a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a balance is closed, § 1026.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a card issuer or a consumer closes a credit card account with a balance, § 1026.55(d)(1) prohibits the card issuer from increasing the annual percentage rate that applies to that balance or imposing a periodic fee based solely on that balance that was not charged before the account was closed (such as a closed account fee) unless permitted by one of the exceptions in § 1026.55(b).
