(vi) Identify all subsidiaries, bank service company investments, and other equity investments that will be retained following the conversion, and provide the information and analysis of the subsidiaries' activities, the bank service company investments, and the other equity investments that would be required if the converting bank or savings association were a national bank establishing each subsidiary or making each bank service company investment or other equity investment pursuant to § 5.34, § 5.35, § 5.36, § 5.39, 12 CFR part 1, or other applicable law and regulation;

(vii) Identify any nonconforming assets (including nonconforming subsidiaries) and nonconforming activities that the institution engages in and describe the plans to retain or divest those assets and activities;

(viii) Include a business plan if the converting institution has been operating for fewer than three years, plans to make significant changes to its business after the conversion, or at the request of the OCC;

(ix) List all outstanding conditions or other requirements imposed by the institution's current appropriate Federal banking agency and, if applicable, current State bank supervisor or State attorney-general in any cease and desist order, written agreement, other formal enforcement order, memorandum of understanding, approval of any application, notice or request, commitment letter, board resolution, or in any other manner, including the converting institution's analysis whether the conversion is prohibited under 12 U.S.C. 35, and State the institution's plans regarding adhering to such conditions or requirements after conversion;

(x) Include a list of directors and senior executive officers, as defined in § 5.51, of the converting institution; and

(3) The OCC may permit a national bank to retain nonconforming assets of a State bank or stock State savings association, subject to conditions and an OCC determination of the carrying value of the retained assets, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 35. The OCC may permit a national bank to continue nonconforming activities of a State bank or stock State savings association, or to retain the nonconforming assets or nonconforming activities of a Federal stock savings association, for a reasonable period of time following a conversion, subject to conditions imposed by the OCC.
