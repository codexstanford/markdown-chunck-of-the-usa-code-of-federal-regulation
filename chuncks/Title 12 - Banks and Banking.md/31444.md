###### Relation to Regulation CC.

1.Credit unions may rely on the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) to determine, for example, when a deposit is considered made for purposes of dividend accrual, or when dividends need not be paid on funds because a deposited check is later returned unpaid.
