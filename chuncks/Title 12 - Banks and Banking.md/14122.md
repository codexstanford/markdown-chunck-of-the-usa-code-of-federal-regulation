6.Section 226.18(g) applies only to closed-end transactions other than transactions that are subject to § 226.18(s). Section 226.18(s) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Thus, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor discloses an interest rate and payment summary table in accordance with § 226.18(s) and does not observe the requirements of § 226.18(g). On the other hand, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is not secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor discloses a payment schedule in accordance with § 226.18(g) and does not observe the requirements of § 226.18(s).
