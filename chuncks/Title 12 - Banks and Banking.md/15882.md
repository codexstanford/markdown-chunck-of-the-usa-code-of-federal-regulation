The definitions ofandin the Wisconsin statutes are preempted by the Regulation CC definition of those terms. For determining the permissible hold under the Wisconsin schedules that supersede the Regulation CC schedule, deposits are considered available for withdrawal on the specified number offollowing theof deposit.

Wisconsin law considers funds to be deposited, for the purpose of determining when they must be made available for withdrawal, when an item is "received at the proof and transit facility of the depository." For the purposes of this preemption determination, funds are considered deposited under Wisconsin law in accordance with the rules set forth in ยง 229.19(a) of Regulation CC.

The Wisconsin statute does not require disclosure of a bank's funds availability policy. The state law does require, however, that a bank give notice to its customer if it extends the time within which funds will be available for withdrawal due to the bank's doubt as to the collectibility of the item (Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m)(b); 215.136(2); and 186.117(2)).
