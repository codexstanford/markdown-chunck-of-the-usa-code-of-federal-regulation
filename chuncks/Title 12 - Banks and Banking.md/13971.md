###### Deferred billing and deferred payment programs.

4.Statements such as "Charge it-you won't be billed until May" or "You may skip your January payment" are not in themselves triggering terms, since the timing for initial billing or for monthly payments are not terms required to be disclosed under ยง 226.6. However, a statement such as "No interest charges until May" or any other statement regarding when interest or finance charges begin to accrue is a triggering term, whether appearing alone or in conjunction with a description of a deferred billing or deferred payment program such as the examples above.
