3.As in the case of a paying bank, a returning bank's return of a returned check is expeditious if it is sent in a manner such that the depositary bank would normally receive the returned check by 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) of the second business day after the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying bank. Although a returning bank will not have firsthand knowledge of the day on which a check was presented to the paying bank, returning banks may, by agreement, allocate with paying banks liability for late return based on the delays caused by each. Paying banks and returning banks are subject to the expeditious return rule, however, under section 229.33(a) a paying or returning bank may be liable to a depositary bank for failing to return a check in an expeditious manner only if the depositary bank has arrangements in place such that the paying bank or returning bank could return a returned check to the depositary bank electronically by commercially reasonable means. The depositary bank has the burden of proof for demonstrating that its arrangements are commercially reasonable.
