4.Maturity is generally not a factor in assigning items to risk categories with the exception of claims on non-OECD banks, commitments, and interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts. Except for commitments, short-term is defined as one year or lessmaturity and long-term is defined as over one yearmaturity. In the case of commitments, short-term is defined as one year or lessmaturity and long-term is defined as over one yearmaturity.
