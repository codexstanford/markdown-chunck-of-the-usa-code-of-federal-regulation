### PART 32 - LENDING LIMITS
#### Appendix A to Part 32 - Interpretations

1. The ยง 32.3(d)(2) exception for loans to one borrower to develop domestic residential housing units is characterized in the regulation as an "alternative" limit. This exceptional $30,000,000 or 30 percent limitation does not operate in addition to the 15 percent General Limitation or the 10 percent additional amount a savings association may loan to one borrower secured by readily marketable collateral, but serves as the uppermost limitation on a savings association's lending to any one person once a savings association employs this exception.

2. a. This result does not change even if the facts are altered to assume that some or all of the $800,000 amount of lending permissible under the General Limitation's 15 percent basket is not used, or is devoted to the development of domestic residential housing units.

b. In other words, using the above example, if Savings Association A lends Y $400,000 for commercial purposes and $300,000 for residential purposes-both of which would be permitted under its $800,000 General Limitation-Savings Association A's remaining permissible lending to Y would be: first, an additional $100,000 under the General Limitation, and then another $800,000 to develop domestic residential housing units if the savings association meets the paragraph ยง 32.3(d)(2) prerequisites. (The latter is $800,000 because in no event may the total lending to Y exceed 30 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus). If Savings Association A did not lend Y the remaining $100,000 permissible under the General Limitation, its permissible loans to develop domestic residential housing units under ยง 32.3(d)(2) would be $900,000 instead of $800,000 (the total loans to Y would still equal $1,600,000).

3. In short, under the ยง 32.3(d)(2) exception, the 30 percent or $30,000,000 limit will always operate as the uppermost limitation, unless the savings association does not avail itself of the exception and merely relies upon its General Limitation.
