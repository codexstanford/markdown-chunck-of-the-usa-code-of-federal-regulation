8.The creditor need not specifically identify the total dollar amount of credits not deducted in computing the finance charge balance. Disclosure of the amount of credits not deducted is accomplished by listing the credits (ยง 226.7(a)(3)) and indicating which credits will not be deducted in determining the balance (for example, "credits after the 15th of the month are not deducted in computing the finance charge.").
