#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Fees in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.

3.With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, § 1026.52(b) applies to any fee for violating the terms or other requirements of the credit feature, regardless of whether those fees are imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. For example, assume that a late fee will be imposed by the card issuer if the covered separate credit feature becomes delinquent or if a payment is not received by a particular date. This fee is subject to § 1026.52(b) regardless of whether the fee is imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account or on the separate credit feature.
