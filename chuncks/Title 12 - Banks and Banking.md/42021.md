##### Examples.

ii.A. Assume that on April 1, 2022, the previous formula is the 1-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR index plus a margin of 10% equal to a 12% annual percentage rate. In this case, the LIBOR index value is 2%. The card issuer selects the prime index published in the Wall Street Journal as the replacement index. The replacement formula used to derive the rate at which the card issuer may terminate its obligation to review factors must be set at a replacement index plus replacement margin that equals 12%. If the prime index is 4% on October 18, 2021, the replacement margin must be 8% in the replacement formula. The replacement formula for purposes of determining when the card issuer can terminate the obligation to review factors is the prime index plus 8%.

B. Assume that on April 1, 2022, the account was not subject to § 1026.59 and the annual percentage rate was the 1-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR index plus a margin of 10% equal to 12%. On May 1, 2022, the card issuer raises the annual percentage rate to the 1-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR index plus a margin of 12% equal to 14%. On June 1, 2022, the card issuer transitions the account from the LIBOR index in accordance with § 1026.55(b)(7)(ii). The card issuer selects the prime index published in the Wall Street Journal as the replacement index with a value on October 18, 2021, of 4%. The replacement formula used to derive the rate at which the card issuer may terminate its obligation to review factors must be set at the value of a replacement index on October 18, 2021, plus replacement margin that equals 12%. In this example, the replacement formula is the prime index plus 8%.
