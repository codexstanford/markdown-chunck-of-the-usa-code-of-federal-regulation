##### Consistent terminology and order of charges.

1.On the Closing Disclosure the creditor must label the corresponding services and costs disclosed under § 1026.38(f) and (g) using terminology that describes each item, as applicable, and must use terminology or the prescribed label, as applicable, that is consistent with that used on the Loan Estimate to identify each corresponding item. In addition, § 1026.38(h)(4) requires the creditor to list the items disclosed under each subcategory of charges in a consistent order. If costs move between subheadings under § 1026.38(f)(2) and (f)(3), listing the costs in alphabetical order in each subheading category is considered to be in compliance with § 1026.38(h)(4). See comment 37(f)(5)-1 for guidance regarding the requirement to use terminology that describes the items to be disclosed.
