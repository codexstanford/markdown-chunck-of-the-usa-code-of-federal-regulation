####### Responsibilities.

(b)It is the responsibility of each compensation committee to review the compensation policies and plans for senior officers and employees and to approve the overall compensation program for senior officers. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the compensation committee must document that it determined the:

(1) Institution's projected long-term compensation and retirement benefit obligations are appropriate to the services performed and not excessive;

(2) Incentive-based compensation programs and payments are reasonable and proportionate to the services performed and structured so the payout schedule considers the potential for future losses or undue risks to the institution;

(3) Senior officer compensation, incentive, and benefit programs support the institution's long-term business strategy and mission, as well as promote safe and sound business practices; and

(4) Compensation programs designed for specific groups of employees, other than senior officers, pose no imprudent risks to the institution.
