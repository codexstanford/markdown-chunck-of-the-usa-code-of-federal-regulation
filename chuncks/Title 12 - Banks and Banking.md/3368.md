##### Ratings in general.

(a)(1) In assigning a rating, the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a bank's or savings association's performance under the applicable performance criteria in this part, in accordance with §§ 25.21 and 25.28. This includes consideration of low-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers and activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions, as well as adjustments on the basis of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.

(2) A bank's or savings association's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance in others. The bank's or savings association's overall performance, however, must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and generally with the appropriate rating profile as follows.
