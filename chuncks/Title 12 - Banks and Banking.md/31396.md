###### Maturity dates on nonbusiness days.

1.In determining the term of a term share account, credit unions may disregard the fact that the term will be extended beyond the disclosed number of days if the maturity date falls on a nonbusiness day. For example, a holiday or weekend may cause a "one-year" term share account to extend beyond 365 days (or 366, in a leap year), or a "one-month" term share account to extend beyond 31 days.
