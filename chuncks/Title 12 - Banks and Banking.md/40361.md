For example, the following are limitations on the consumer's liability that must be included in the projected total cost of credit:

i. A limit on the consumer's liability to a certain percentage of the projected value of the home.

ii. A limit on the consumer's liability to the net proceeds from the sale of the property subject to the reverse mortgage.
