2.Creditors that use electronic mail or a courier other than the United States Postal Service also may follow the approach for disclosures provided by mail described in comment 19(f)(1)(iii)-1. For example, if a creditor sends a disclosure required under § 1026.19(f) via email on Monday, pursuant to § 1026.19(f)(1)(iii) the consumer is considered to have received the disclosure on Thursday, three business days later. The creditor may, alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the emailed disclosures earlier after delivery. See comment 19(e)(1)(iv)-2 for an example in which the creditor emails disclosures and receives an acknowledgment from the consumer on the same day. Creditors using electronic delivery methods, such as email, must also comply with § 1026.38(t)(3)(iii). For example, if a creditor delivers the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) to a consumer via email, but the creditor did not obtain the consumer's consent to receive disclosures via email prior to delivering the disclosures, then the creditor does not comply with § 1026.38(t)(3)(iii), and the creditor does not comply with § 1026.19(f)(1)(i), assuming the disclosures were not provided in a different manner in accordance with the timing requirements of § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii).
