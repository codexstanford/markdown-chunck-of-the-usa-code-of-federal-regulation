#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Timing of refunds and relation to other provisions.

4.The refund of fees must be made as soon as reasonably possible after the creditor is notified that the consumer is not entering into the plan because of the changed term, or that the consumer wants a refund of fees. The fact that an application fee may be refunded to some applicants under this provision does not render such fees finance charges under § 1026.4(c)(1) of the regulation.
