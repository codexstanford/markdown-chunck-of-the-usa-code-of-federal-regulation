### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Balloon payment.

iv.If a loan product includes a "balloon payment," as that term is defined in § 1026.37(b)(5), the disclosure of the balloon payment feature, including the year the payment is due, precedes the disclosure of the loan product. Thus, if the loan product is a step rate with an introductory rate that lasts for three years and adjusts each year thereafter until the balloon payment is due in the seventh year of the loan term, the disclosure required is "Year 7 Balloon Payment, 3/1 Step Rate." If the loan product includes more than one balloon payment, only the earliest year that a balloon payment is due shall be disclosed.
