9.A member who fails to complete payment of one share within __________ of his admission to membership, or within __________ from the increase in the par value in shares, or a member who reduces his share balance below the par value of one share and does not increase the balance to at least the par value of one share within __________ of the reduction may be terminated from membership at the end of a dividend period. [All blanks should be filled with time chosen by credit union board of directors.] Shares may be transferred only from one member to another, by written instrument in such form as the Credit Union may prescribe. The Credit Union reserves the right, at any time, to require members to give, in writing, not more than 60 days notice of intention to withdraw the whole or any part of the amounts so paid in by them. Shares paid in under an accumulated payroll deduction plan may not be withdrawn until credited to a member's account. No member may withdraw shareholdings that are pledged as required on security on loans without the written approval of the credit committee or a loan officer, except to the extent that such shares exceed the member's total primary and contingent liability to the Credit Union. No member may withdraw any shareholdings below the amount of his/her primary or contingent liability to the Credit Union if he/she is delinquent as a borrower, or if borrowers for whom he/she is comaker, endorser, or guarantor are delinquent, without the written approval of the credit committee or loan officer.
