##### Non-federally related mortgage loans.

1.For a transaction that is not a federally related mortgage loan, the creditor is not required to use form H-25 of appendix H to this part, although its use as a model form for such transactions, if properly completed with accurate content, constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of § 1026.38(t)(1)(i). Even when the creditor elects not to use the model form, § 1026.38(t)(1)(ii) requires that the disclosures contain only the information required by § 1026.38(a) through (s), and that the creditor make the disclosures in the same order as they occur in form H-25, use the same headings, labels, and similar designations as used in the form (many of which also are expressly required by § 1026.38(a) through (s)), and position the disclosures relative to those designations in the same manner as shown in the form. In order to be in a format substantially similar to form H-25, the disclosures required by § 1026.38 must be provided on letter size (8.5&#x2033; x 11&#x2033;) paper.
