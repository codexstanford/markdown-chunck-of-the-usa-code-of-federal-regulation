For the avoidance of doubt, any Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent did not enter on behalf of a Client and which the Agent does not have the authority from the relevant Client to amend will not constitute a Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document.

(C) Subject to subparagraph 3(g)(iv)(A) above, following the delivery of any such evidence by the Agent to the other Adhering Party, unless the other Adhering Party notifies the Agent to the contrary by the end of the fifteenth calendar day following the day on which such evidence is delivered, the Agent shall be deemed to have provided reasonable evidence satisfactory to the other Adhering Party at the end of that fifteenth calendar day;

(D) If: (I)

(I) following written request from the other Adhering Party, the Agent does not provide the other Adhering Party with any evidence supporting its authority to amend such documents or, if subparagraph 3(g)(iv)(A) above applies, with an additional copy of the relevant agreement or extracts, by the end of the fifteenth calendar day following such written request; or

If, in respect of a Client, more than one Adherence Letter is accepted by ISDA in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above (by virtue of the Client adhering on its own behalf and one or more Agents adhering on behalf of that Client), then:

(A) If ISDA accepts an Adherence Letter from an Agent on behalf of a Client after it accepts an Adherence Letter from that Client, any document entered into by:

(I) The Protocol Effective Date; or if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from that Client (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from the other Adhering Party), will be deemed to have "a Protocol Covered Document Date prior to the Protocol Effective Date (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere)" for the purposes of the definitions of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document and Protocol Covered Master Agreement below.

(vii) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol on behalf of a Client, then as of the later of (A) the date on which such Agent adheres to this Protocol in accordance with paragraph 1 above and (B) the Protocol Covered Document Date, such Agent represents to each Adhering Party (I) with which it has entered into a Protocol Covered Document on behalf of such Client or (II) which is a party to any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document (which representation will be deemed to be repeated on the Protocol Effective Date and on the Implementation Date if one or both such dates are later than the date on which such Agent adheres to this Protocol) that it has, as at the relevant Implementation Date, all necessary authority to enter into the Adherence Letter on behalf of such Client. In respect of any Client referred to in paragraph 3(h), paragraph 3(i), paragraph 3(j) or paragraph 3(k) below, the Agent represents that it has, as at the relevant Implementation Date, all necessary authority to apply the terms of the Adherence Letter to such Client.
