###### Substantial similarity.

2.The "substantially similar" standard requires that state statutory or regulatory provisions and state interpretations of those provisions be generally the same as the Federal Act and Regulation Z. This includes the requirement that state provisions for reimbursement to consumers for overcharges be at least equivalent to those required in section 108 of the act. A State will be eligible for an exemption even if its law covers classes of transactions not covered by the Federal law. For example, if a state's law covers agricultural credit, this will not prevent the Board from granting an exemption for consumer credit, even though agricultural credit is not covered by the Federal law.
