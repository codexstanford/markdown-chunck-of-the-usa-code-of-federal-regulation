### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### As applicable.

1.i. The disclosures required by this section need be made only as applicable. Any disclosure not relevant to a particular transaction may be eliminated entirely. For example:

A. In a loan transaction, the creditor may delete disclosure of the total sale price.

B. In a credit sale requiring disclosure of the total sale price under § 1026.18(j), the creditor may delete any reference to a downpayment where no downpayment is involved.

ii. Where the amounts of several numerical disclosures are the same, the "as applicable" language also permits creditors to combine the terms, so long as it is done in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example:

A. In a transaction in which the amount financed equals the total of payments, the creditor may disclose "amount financed/total of payments," together with descriptive language, followed by a single amount.

B. However, if the terms are separated on the disclosure statement and separate space is provided for each amount, both disclosures must be completed, even though the same amount is entered in each space.
