### PART 1006-DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES (REGULATION F)
#### Supplement I to Part 1006-Official Interpretations
##### Substantially similar form.

1.Pursuant to § 1006.34(d)(2)(iii), a debt collector who uses Model Form B-1 as described in § 1006.34(d)(2)(i) may make changes to the form and retain the safe harbor for compliance with the information and form requirements of § 1006.34(c) and (d)(1) provided that the form remains substantially similar in substance, clarity, and meaningful sequence to Model Form B-1. Permissible changes include, for example:

i. Modifications to remove language that could suggest liability for the debt if such language is not applicable. For example, if a debt collector sends a validation notice to a person who is authorized to act on behalf of the deceased consumer's estate (see comment 34(a)(1)-1), and that person is not liable for the debt, the debt collector may use the name of the deceased consumer instead of "you";

ii. Relocating the consumer-response information required by § 1006.34(c)(4) to facilitate mailing;

iii. Adding barcodes or QR codes, as long as the inclusion of such items does not violate § 1006.38(b);

iv. Adding the date the form is generated; and

v. Embedding hyperlinks, if delivering the form electronically.
