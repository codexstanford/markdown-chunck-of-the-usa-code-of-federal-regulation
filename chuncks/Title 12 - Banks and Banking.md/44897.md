#### PART 1225 - MINIMUM CAPITAL - TEMPORARY INCREASE
##### § 1225.4 Standards and factors.
###### Standard for imposing a temporary increase.

(a)In making a determination to increase temporarily a minimum capital requirement for a regulated entity or entities, the Director will consider the necessity and consistency of such an increase with the prudential regulation and the safe and sound operations of a regulated entity. The Director may impose a temporary minimum-capital increase if consideration of one or more of the following factors leads the Director to the judgment that the current minimum capital requirement for a regulated entity is insufficient to address the entity's risks:

(1) Current or anticipated declines in the value of assets held by a regulated entity; the amounts of mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the regulated entity; and, its ability to access liquidity and funding;

(2) Credit (including counterparty), market, operational and other risks facing a regulated entity, especially where an increase in risks is foreseeable and consequential;

(3) Current or projected declines in the capital held by a regulated entity;

(4) A regulated entity's material non-compliance with regulations, written orders, or agreements;

(5) Housing finance market conditions;

(6) Level of reserves or retained earnings;

(7) Initiatives, operations, products, or practices that entail heightened risk;

(8) With respect to a Bank, the ratio of the market value of its equity to par value of its capital stock where the market value of equity is the value calculated and reported by the Bank as "market value of total capital" under 12 CFR 932.5(a)(1)(ii)(A); or

(9) Other conditions as detailed by the Director in the notice provided under § 1225.3.
