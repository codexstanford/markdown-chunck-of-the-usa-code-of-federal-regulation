The certification shall indicate the date on which the transferring institution's authority to engage in banking has terminated or will terminate as well as the method of termination (e.g., whether by the surrender of its charter, by the cancellation of its charter or license to conduct a banking business, or otherwise). The certification may follow the form contained in Appendix A of this part. In a merger or consolidation where there is only one surviving entity which is the legal successor to both the transferring and assuming institutions, the surviving entity shall provide any required certification.
