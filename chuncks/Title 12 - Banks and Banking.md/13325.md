1.Applications or solicitations contained in generally available publications mailed to consumers (such as subscription magazines) are subject to the requirements applicable toin § 226.5a(e), rather than the direct mail requirements of § 226.5a(c). However, if a primary purpose of a card issuer's mailing is to offer credit or charge card accounts-for example, where a card issuer "prescreens" a list of potential cardholders using credit criteria, and then mails to the targeted group its catalog containing an application or a solicitation for a card account-the direct mail rules apply. In addition, a card issuer may use a single application form as a(in racks in public locations, for example) and for direct mailings, if the card issuer complies with the requirements of § 226.5a(c) even when the form is used as a-that is, by presenting the required § 226.5a disclosures in a tabular format. When used in a direct mailing, the credit term disclosures must be accurate as of the mailing date whether or not the § 226.5a(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) disclosures are included; when used in athe disclosures must be accurate for as long as theforms remain available to the public if the § 226.5a(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) disclosures are omitted. (If those disclosures are included in the take-one, the credit term disclosures need only be accurate as of the printing date.)
