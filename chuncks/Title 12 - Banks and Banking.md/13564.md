2.Creditors that choose to disclose an annual percentage rate calculated under ยง 226.14(c) and label the figure as "annual percentage rate" must label the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate as the "corresponding APR," "nominal APR," or a similar phrase as provided in comment 7(a)(4)-4. Creditors also comply with the label requirement if the rate calculated under ยง 226.14(c) is described as the "effective APR" or something similar. For those creditors, the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate could be labeled "annual percentage rate," consistent with the requirement under ยง 226.7(b)(4). If the two rates represent different values, creditors must label the rates differently to meet the clear and conspicuous standard under ยง 226.5(a)(1).
