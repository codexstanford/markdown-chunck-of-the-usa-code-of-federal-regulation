###### Original maturity,i.e.,

means, with respect to a commitment, the earliest date after a commitment is made on which the commitment is scheduled to expire (it will reach its stated maturity and cease to be binding on either party), provided that either:

(1) The commitment is not subject to extension or renewal and will actually expire on its stated expiration date; or

(2) If the commitment is subject to extension or renewal beyond its stated expiration date, the stated expiration date will be deemed the original maturity only if the extension or renewal must be based upon terms and conditions independently negotiated in good faith with the member at the time of the extension or renewal and upon a new, bona fide credit analysis utilizing current information on financial condition and trends.
