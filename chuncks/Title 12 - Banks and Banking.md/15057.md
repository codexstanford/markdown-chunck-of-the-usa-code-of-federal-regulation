2.Assume that on December 31 of year one the annual percentage rate that applies to a $5,000 balance on a credit card account is a variable rate that is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index that is not under the card issuer's control. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer reduces the rate that applies to the $5,000 balance to a non-variable rate of 6% pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527. On January 1 of year three, 50 U.S.C. app. 527 ceases to apply and the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to ยง 226.9(c) informing the consumer that on February 15 of year three the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin will apply to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance. On February 15 of year three, ยง 226.55(b)(6) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest on any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance at the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin.
