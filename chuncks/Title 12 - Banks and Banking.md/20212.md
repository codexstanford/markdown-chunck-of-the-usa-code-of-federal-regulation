#### PART 264b - RULES REGARDING FOREIGN GIFTS AND DECORATIONS
##### ยง 264b.5 Gifts of more than minimal value.
###### Other gifts.

(c)(1) Board employees may typically regard the refusal of gifts of more than minimal value at the inception (when offered or received without a prior offer) as consistent with the interests and general policy of the United States.

(2) Board employees may accept gifts of more than minimal value when it appears that refusal would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. Tangible gifts are considered to have been accepted on behalf of the United States and become the property of the United States on acceptance. Accordingly, they must be deposited and documented in accordance with ยง 264b.6(a) and can only be returned or otherwise processed by the Office of the Secretary under ยง 264b.8.
