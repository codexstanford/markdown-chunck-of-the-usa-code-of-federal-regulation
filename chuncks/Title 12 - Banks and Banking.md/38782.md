#### Appendix M1 to Part 1026 - Repayment Disclosures
##### Assumptions.

(4)When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, a card issuer for each of the terms below, may either make the following assumption about that term, or use the account term that applies to a consumer's account.

(i) Only minimum monthly payments are made each month. In addition, minimum monthly payments are made each month-for example, a debt cancellation or suspension agreement, or skip payment feature does not apply to the account.

(ii) No additional extensions of credit are obtained, such as new purchases, transactions, fees, charges or other activity. No refunds or rebates are given.

(iii) The annual percentage rate or rates that apply to a cardholder's account will not change, through either the operation of a variable rate or the change to a rate, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this Appendix. For example, if a penalty annual percentage rate currently applies to a consumer's account, a card issuer may assume that the penalty annual percentage rate will apply to the consumer's account indefinitely, even if the consumer may potentially return to a non-penalty annual percentage rate in the future under the account agreement.

(iv) There is no grace period.
