#### PART 1238 - STRESS TESTING OF REGULATED ENTITIES
##### § 1238.1 Authority and purpose.
###### Purpose.

(b)(1) This part implements section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by section 401 of the EGRRCPA, which requires all large financial companies that have total consolidated assets of more than $250 billion, and are regulated by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, to conduct periodic stress tests.

(2) This part establishes requirements that apply to each Enterprise's performance of periodic stress tests. The purpose of the periodic stress test is to provide the Enterprises, FHFA, and the FRB with additional, forward-looking information that will help them to assess capital adequacy at the Enterprises under various scenarios; to review the Enterprises' stress test results; and to increase public disclosure of the Enterprises' capital condition by requiring broad dissemination of the stress test scenarios and results.
