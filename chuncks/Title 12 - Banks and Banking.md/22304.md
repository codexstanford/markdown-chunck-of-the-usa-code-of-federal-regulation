####### Issuance of directives.

(b)If an FDIC-supervised institution is operating with less than the minimum leverage capital requirement established by this regulation, the FDIC Board of Directors, or its designee(s), may issue and serve upon any FDIC-supervised institution a directive requiring the FDIC-supervised institution to restore its capital to the minimum leverage capital requirement within a specified time period. The directive may require the FDIC-supervised institution to submit to the appropriate FDIC regional director, or other specified official, for review and approval, a plan describing the means and timing by which the FDIC-supervised institution shall achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement. After the FDIC has approved the plan, the FDIC-supervised institution may be required under the terms of the directive to adhere to and monitor compliance with the plan. The directive may be issued during the course of an examination of the FDIC-supervised institution, or at any other time that the FDIC deems appropriate, if the FDIC-supervised institution is found to be operating with less than the minimum leverage capital requirement.
