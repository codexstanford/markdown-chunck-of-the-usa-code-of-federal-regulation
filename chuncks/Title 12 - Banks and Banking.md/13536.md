###### Disclosure of periodic rates required only if imposition possible.,could have

2.With regard to the periodic rate disclosure (and its corresponding annual percentage rate), only rates thatbeen imposed during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement need to be disclosed. For example:

i. If the creditor is changing rates effective during the next billing cycle (because of a variable-rate plan), the rates required to be disclosed under ยง 226.7(a)(4) are only those in effect during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement. For example, if the monthly rate applied during May was 1.5%, but the creditor will increase the rate to 1.8% effective June 1, 1.5% (and its corresponding annual percentage rate) is the only required disclosure under ยง 226.7(a)(4) for the periodic statement reflecting the May account activity.

ii. If rates applicable to a particular type of transaction changed after a certain date and the old rate is only being applied to transactions that took place prior to that date, the creditor need not continue to disclose the old rate for those consumers that have no outstanding balances to which that rate could be applied.
