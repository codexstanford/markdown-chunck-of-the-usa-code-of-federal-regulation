##### Rating.

(3)The appropriate Federal banking agency assesses the performance of a bank or savings association operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank or savings association has met its plan goals:

(i) If the bank or savings association substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the appropriate Federal banking agency will rate the bank's or savings association's performance under the plan as "satisfactory."

(ii) If the bank or savings association exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the appropriate Federal banking agency will rate the bank's or savings association's performance under the plan as "outstanding."

(iii) If the bank or savings association fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the appropriate Federal banking agency will rate the bank or savings association as either "needs to improve" or "substantial noncompliance," depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, unless the bank or savings association elected in its plan to be rated otherwise, as provided in ยง 25.27(f)(4).
