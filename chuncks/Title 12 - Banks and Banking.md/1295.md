###### Prefiling meeting.

(f)Before submitting a filing to the OCC, a potential filer is encouraged to contact the appropriate OCC licensing office to determine the need for a prefiling meeting. The OCC decides whether to require a prefiling meeting on a case-by-case basis. Submission of a draft business plan or other relevant information before any prefiling meeting may expedite the filing review process. A potential filer considering a novel, complex, or unique proposal is encouraged to contact the appropriate OCC licensing office to schedule a prefiling meeting early in the development of its proposal for the early identification and consideration of policy issues. Information on model business plans can be found in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual.
