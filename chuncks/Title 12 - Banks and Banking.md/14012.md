###### Content of segregated disclosures.

4.Footnotes 37 and 38 contain exceptions to the requirement that the disclosures under § 226.18 be segregated from material that is not directly related to those disclosures. Footnote 37 lists the items that may be added to the segregated disclosures, even though not directly related to those disclosures. Footnote 38 lists the items required under § 226.18 that may be deleted from the segregated disclosures and appear elsewhere. Any one or more of these additions or deletions may be combined and appear either together with or separate from the segregated disclosures. The itemization of the amount financed under § 226.18(c), however, must be separate from the other segregated disclosures under § 226.18, except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance with § 226.47. If a creditor chooses to include the security interest charges required to be itemized under § 226.4(e) and § 226.18(o) in the amount financed itemization, it need not list these charges elsewhere.
