###### Measuring odd periods.

2.In determining whether a transaction may take advantage of the rule in ยง 226.17(c)(4), the creditor must measure the variation against a regular period. For purposes of that rule:

- The first period is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the first payment.

- The term is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the final payment.

- The regular period is the most common interval between payments in the transaction.

In transactions involving regular periods that are monthly, semimonthly or multiples of a month, the length of the irregular and regular periods may be calculated on the basis of either the actual number of days or an assumed 30-day month. In other transactions, the length of the periods is based on the actual number of days.
