####### Prepayment fees.

(b)(1) Except where an advance product contains a prepayment option, each Bank shall establish and charge a prepayment fee pursuant to a specified formula which makes the Bank financially indifferent to the borrower's decision to repay the advance prior to its maturity date.

(2) Prepayment fees are not required for:

(i) Advances with original terms to maturity or repricing periods of six months or less;

(ii) Advances funded by callable debt; or

(iii) Advances which are otherwise appropriately hedged so that the Bank is financially indifferent to their prepayment.

(3) The board of directors of each Bank, a designated committee thereof, or officers specifically authorized by the board of directors, may waive a prepayment fee only if such prepayment will not result in an economic loss to the Bank. Any such waiver must subsequently be ratified by the board of directors.

(4) A Bank, in determining whether or not to waive a prepayment fee, shall apply consistent standards to all of its members.
