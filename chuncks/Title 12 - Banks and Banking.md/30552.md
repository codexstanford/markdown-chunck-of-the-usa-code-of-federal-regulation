###### Simple modified look-through approach.

(3)Under the simple modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a credit union's exposure to an investment fund equals the exposure amount multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).
