#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Consumer credit.

1.In general, § 1026.43 applies to consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, but certain dwelling-secured consumer credit transactions are exempt or partially exempt from coverage under § 1026.43(a)(1) through (3). (See § 1026.2(a)(12) for the definition of "consumer credit.") Section 1026.43 does not apply to an extension of credit primarily for a business, commercial, or agricultural purpose, even if it is secured by a dwelling. See § 1026.3 and associated commentary for guidance in determining the primary purpose of an extension of credit. In addition, § 1026.43 does not apply to any change to an existing loan that is not treated as a refinancing under § 1026.20(a).
