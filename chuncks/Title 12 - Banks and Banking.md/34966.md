2.In order to indicate clearly and conspicuously that the provider's fee has changed as required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: "Transfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30." To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should also indicate that those figures are updated.
