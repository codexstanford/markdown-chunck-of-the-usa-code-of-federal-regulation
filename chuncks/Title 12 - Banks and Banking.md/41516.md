2.The following example illustrates the rule described in comment 43(d)(5)(ii)-1: A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan agreement provides for an interest rate of 6 percent that is fixed for an initial period of five years, after which time the interest rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap. The creditor must determine whether the standard mortgage monthly payment is materially lower than the non-standard mortgage monthly payment (§ 1026.43(d)(2)(ii)) based on a standard mortgage payment of $1,199. This is the substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest required to repay $200,000 over 30 years at an interest rate of 6 percent.
