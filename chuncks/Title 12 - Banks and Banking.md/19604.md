(b) If a Relevant Rate (as defined in the 1991 ISDA Definitions) is to be determined pursuant to Section 4.3(b) () of the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions and "rates for deposits in euros" referred to in that section are required for any determination but are not available, they shall be deemed to be references to a Relevant IBOR (and, in particular, the euro interbank offered rate) to which paragraph 6 of this Attachment applies.

A Protocol Covered Document of the type described in subparagraph (b) of, respectively, the definition of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document or Protocol Covered Master Agreement shall be amended so that the reference to the Relevant IBOR "as defined in", or the reference to the Relevant IBOR as having the meaning given in, the Covered ISDA Definitions Booklet will instead be a reference to the relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (or, if there is more than one relevant Rate Option, the first relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement) for the Relevant IBOR "as defined in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement" (and, if that Protocol Covered Document is a Protocol Covered Master Agreement, any reference to the Relevant IBOR (as defined in that Protocol Covered Master Agreement) in a Confirmation which supplements, forms part of and is subject to that Protocol Covered Master Agreement will be a reference to the relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (or, if there is more than one relevant Rate Option, the first relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement) for the Relevant IBOR "as defined in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement"), provided that:

(a) If the Relevant IBOR is:

(i) "EUR-EURIBOR-Telerate", it will be deemed to be a reference to "EUR-EURIBOR- Reuters";

(ii) "AUD-BBR-ISDC", it will be deemed to be a reference to "AUD-BBR-AUBBSW";

(iii) "XEU-LIBOR-BBA", it will be deemed to be a reference to "EUR-LIBOR-BBA"; and

(iv) "SGD-SOR-Telerate", it will be deemed to be a reference to "SGD-SOR-VWAP", in each case, as defined in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement; and

(b) If the Relevant IBOR is "THB-THBFIX-Reuters" and the Covered ISDA Definitions Booklet is the 2000 ISDA Definitions, the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement shall be deemed amended in accordance with subparagraph 2(e) of this Attachment.

If a Protocol Covered Document is of the type described in subparagraph (c) of, respectively, the definition of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document or Protocol Covered Master Agreement and, in each case, includes a reference to a Relevant IBOR pursuant to which the Relevant IBOR is required for any determination, and:

(a) (i) the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is neither the Singapore dollar swap offer rate nor the Thai baht interest rate fixing, (ii) the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Relevant IBOR on the day on which it is required, and (iii) an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to the Relevant IBOR has not occurred, then the reference to the Relevant IBOR will be deemed to be a reference to the rate as provided by the administrator of the Relevant IBOR and published by an authorized distributor of the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR itself in respect of the day on which it is required. If neither an authorized distributor nor the administrator has published or provided the Relevant IBOR in respect of that day and an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to the Relevant IBOR has not occurred, then, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the reference to the Relevant IBOR will be deemed to be a reference to:

(A) A rate formally recommended for use by the administrator of the Relevant IBOR; or

(B) A rate formally recommended for use by:

(I) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is Swiss franc LIBOR, the competent authority responsible for supervising that rate or the administrator of that rate;

(II) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is sterling LIBOR, euro LIBOR or the euro interbank offered rate, the supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR;

(III) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is Japanese yen LIBOR, the Japanese yen Tokyo interbank offered rate or the euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate, a committee officially endorsed or convened by the Bank of Japan for the purposes of recommending an alternative rate for that Relevant IBOR (which rate may be produced by the Bank of Japan or another administrator) or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR;

(IV) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR; and

(V) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the bank bill swap rate, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (or any successor to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in its role as supervisor of the bank bill swap rate),

In each case, during the period of non-publication of the Relevant IBOR and for so long as an Index Cessation Effective Date has not occurred. If a rate described in subparagraph (A) above is available, that rate shall apply. If no such rate is available but, in respect of the Relevant IBOR, a rate described in subparagraph (B) above, if applicable, is available, that rate shall apply. If neither a rate described in subparagraph (A) above is available nor a rate described in subparagraph (B) above, if applicable, is available, then the Calculation Agent shall determine a commercially reasonable alternative for the Relevant IBOR, taking into account any rate implemented by central counterparties and/or futures exchanges, in each case with trading volumes in derivatives or futures referencing the Relevant IBOR that the Calculation Agent considers sufficient for that rate to be a representative alternative rate.

If the Relevant IBOR is the Hong Kong interbank offered rate and the Protocol Covered Document provides that the Hong Kong Association of Banks' (or any successor's) typhoon and rainstorm arrangements (as published on the Hong Kong Association of Banks' website or on any successor website) apply, then those typhoon and rainstorm arrangements shall continue to apply and shall take precedence over the provisions of this paragraph 6(a);

(b) (i) The Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate, (ii) the Singapore dollar swap offer rate has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate on the day on which it is required and (iii) an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, then the reference to the Singapore dollar swap offer rate will be deemed to be a reference to the substitute rate announced by ABS Benchmarks Administration Co Pte. Ltd. (or its successor as administrator or sponsor of that rate) in respect of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate.

If ABS Benchmarks Administration Co Pte. Ltd. (or its successor as administrator or sponsor of that rate) has not announced a substitute rate by 9:00 p.m., Singapore time, on the Relevant Original Fixing Date and an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, then, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the reference to the Singapore dollar swap offer rate will be deemed to be a reference to:

(A) A rate formally recommended for use by the administrator of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate; or

(B) A rate formally recommended for use by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the administrator of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate) or a committee officially endorsed or convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the administrator of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate), in each case, during the period of non-publication of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate and for so long as an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred. If a rate described in subparagraph (A) above is available, that rate shall apply. If no such rate is available but a rate described in subparagraph (B) above is available, that rate shall apply. If neither a rate described in subparagraph (A) above nor a rate described in subparagraph (B) above is available, then the Calculation Agent shall determine a commercially reasonable alternative for the Singapore dollar swap offer rate, taking into account any rate implemented by central counterparties and/or futures exchanges, in each case with trading volumes in derivatives or futures referencing the Singapore dollar swap offer rate that the Calculation Agent considers sufficient for that rate to be a representative alternative rate;

(c) (i) the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the Thai baht interest rate fixing, (ii) the Thai baht interest rate fixing has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Thai baht interest rate fixing on the day on which it is required and (iii) an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, then the reference to the Thai baht interest rate fixing will be deemed to be a reference to "THB-THBFIX-Reference Banks" (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions) but with the references to (A) "Reset Date" being replaced by "the day on which the rate is required"; (B) "Designated Maturity" being replaced by "the period of time in respect of which the Thai baht interest rate fixing is to be determined"; (C) "Calculation Period" being replaced by "period"; and (D) "Representative Amount" being replaced by "an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time". If the rate cannot be determined pursuant to "THB-THBFIX-Reference Banks" (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions) andan Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, the rate will be determined by the Calculation Agent taking into consideration all available information that in good faith it deems relevant;

(d) Subject to paragraphs 6(e), (f) and (g) below, an Index Cessation Event has occurred with respect to the Relevant IBOR (or, if the Relevant IBOR is either the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing, with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR), then the reference to the Relevant IBOR will be deemed to be a reference to the Applicable Fallback Rate from and including either the Index Cessation Effective Date or, if the Relevant IBOR is observed on a day that is a period of time prior to the date for which the Relevant IBOR is set, such period of time following the Index Cessation Effective Date, provided that:

(i) If the Applicable Fallback Rate is Fallback Rate (SONIA), Fallback Rate (SARON), Fallback Rate (SOFR), Fallback Rate (EuroSTR), Fallback Rate (TONA), Fallback Rate (AONIA), Fallback Rate (CORRA), Fallback Rate (HONIA), Fallback Rate (SOR) or Fallback Rate (THBFIX), then the rate for the Relevant Original Fixing Date will be the Applicable Fallback Rate for the `Original IBOR Rate Record Day' (or, if Fallback Rate (SOR) or Fallback Rate (THBFIX) is the Applicable Fallback Rate, for the `Original SOR Rate Record Day' or `Original THBFIX Rate Record Day', as applicable) that corresponds to the Relevant Original Fixing Date, as most recently provided or published as at the Applicable Cut-off Time. If neither the provider of the Applicable Fallback Rate (or a successor provider, which, if the Applicable Fallback Rate is Fallback Rate (SONIA), Fallback Rate (SARON), Fallback Rate (SOFR), Fallback Rate (EuroSTR), Fallback Rate (TONA), Fallback Rate (AONIA), Fallback Rate (CORRA) or Fallback Rate (HONIA), is approved and/or appointed by ISDA from time to time) provides, nor any authorized distributors publish, the Applicable Fallback Rate for that `Original IBOR Rate Record Day' (or that `Original SOR Rate Record Day' or `Original THBFIX Rate Record Day', as applicable) at, or prior to, the Applicable Cut-off Time and a Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to that Applicable Fallback Rate has not occurred, then the rate for the Relevant Original Fixing Date will be the Applicable Fallback Rate as most recently provided or published at the Applicable Cut-off Time for the most recent `Original IBOR Rate Record Day' (or `Original SOR Rate Record Day' or `Original THBFIX Rate Record Day', as applicable), notwithstanding that such day does not correspond to the Relevant Original Fixing Date;

(ii) If (A) the Applicable Fallback Rate is SONIA, the GBP Recommended Rate, SARON, the NWG Recommended Rate, the Modified SNB Policy Rate, SOFR, the Fed Recommended Rate, OBFR, the FOMC Target Rate, EuroSTR, the ECB Recommended Rate, Modified EDFR, TONA, the JPY Recommended Rate, AONIA, the RBA Recommended Rate, CORRA, the CAD Recommended Rate, the BOC Target Rate, HONIA, the HKD Recommended Rate, the MAS Recommended Rate, SORA, the BOT Recommended Rate or THOR, (B) neither the administrator provides nor authorized distributors publish that Applicable Fallback Rate (or if the Applicable Fallback Rate is the Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the definition thereof) and (C) a Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to that Applicable Fallback Rate has not occurred, then, in respect of any day for which that Applicable Fallback Rate is required, references to that Applicable Fallback Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published Applicable Fallback Rate. If the Applicable Fallback Rate is the Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, references to that Applicable Fallback Rate in subparagraph 6(d)(ii)(C) above shall be deemed to be references to the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the definition of Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, as applicable; and

(iii) If the Applicable Fallback Rate is UK Bank Rate, in respect of any day for which the UK Bank Rate is required, references to the UK Bank Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published UK Bank Rate as at close of business in London on that day.

If the Relevant IBOR is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing, an Index Cessation Event with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR will also occur if the Relevant IBOR in the relevant tenor (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be equivalent to the "Designated Maturity") has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Relevant IBOR and, as of the Relevant Original Fixing Date, U.S. dollar LIBOR in the relevant tenor (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be equivalent to the "Designated Maturity") has been permanently discontinued or is Non-Representative and there is either no U.S. dollar LIBOR which has not been permanently discontinued and which is not Non-Representative for a period which is longer than that relevant tenor or no U.S. dollar LIBOR which has not been permanently discontinued and which is not Non-Representative for a period which is shorter than that relevant tenor. The related Index Cessation Effective Date shall be the first date on which there is no such longer or shorter rate or, if later, the first date on which U.S. dollar LIBOR in the relevant tenor (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be equivalent to the "Designated Maturity") is permanently unavailable or Non-Representative.

For the purposes of this paragraph 6(d), references to an "Original IBOR Rate Record Day", "Original SOR Rate Record Day" and "Original THBFIX Rate Record Day" are to that term as used on the Fallback Rate Screen. For the purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph above, (A) references to a rate being "permanently discontinued" or "permanently unavailable" shall be deemed to be references to such rate being permanently discontinued or permanently unavailable following a public statement or publication of information which would constitute an Index Cessation Event in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) of the definition thereof in respect of that rate in the relevant tenor and (B) references to "U.S. dollar LIBOR" in the definition of "Non-Representative" shall be deemed to be references to the relevant tenor of U.S. dollar LIBOR;

(e) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is neither the Singapore dollar swap offer rate nor the Thai baht interest rate fixing and:

(i) The determination for which the Relevant IBOR is required is ordinarily made by reference to linear interpolation between two rates, each of which is based on the Relevant IBOR, then (notwithstanding paragraph 6(d) above) the provisions of Section 7.9(a) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions shall be deemed to apply, provided that the Calculation Agent shall make such adaptations as are reasonable and necessary to the provisions of Section 7.9(a) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions in order to apply them to the relevant Protocol Covered Document;

(ii) The Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is to be determined by reference to one or more rates, either (A) at least one of which has been permanently discontinued, or (B) if the Relevant IBOR is a Relevant LIBOR, at least one of which is Non-Representative, and, in either case, at least two Relevant IBOR tenors, at least one of which is shorter than the period of time in respect of which the Relevant IBOR is to be determined and at least one of which is longer than the period of time in respect of which the Relevant IBOR is to be determined, have not been permanently discontinued (and, if the Relevant IBOR is a Relevant LIBOR, are not Non- Representative), then the provisions of Section 8.5 and Section 8.6 of the 2006 ISDA Definitions shall be deemed to apply, provided that the Calculation Agent shall make such adaptations as are reasonable and necessary to the provisions of Sections 8.5 and 8.6 of the 2006 ISDA Definitions in order to apply them to the relevant Protocol Covered Document;

(iii) The Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is to be determined by reference to a tenor of the Relevant IBOR which has been permanently discontinued (or, if the Relevant IBOR is a Relevant LIBOR, which is Non-Representative), and there are either no shorter or no longer tenors in respect of the Relevant IBOR which have not been permanently discontinued (or, if the Relevant IBOR is a Relevant LIBOR, which are not Non-Representative), then an Index Cessation Event shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Relevant IBOR and the Index Cessation Effective Date shall be the first date on which there is either no such shorter or no such longer tenor or, if later, the first date on which the Relevant IBOR in the relevant tenor is permanently unavailable (or, if the Relevant IBOR is a Relevant LIBOR, Non-Representative);

(iv) In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of subparagraph 6(e)(ii) or subparagraph 6(e)(iii) above and the provisions of subparagraph 6(e)(i) above, subparagraph 6(e)(i) above shall prevail; and

(v) In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of subparagraph 6(e)(ii) or subparagraph 6(e)(iii) above and paragraph 6(d) above (including any terms used in paragraph 6(d) above and defined below), subparagraph 6(e)(ii) or subparagraph 6(e)(iii) above (as applicable) shall prevail,

For the purposes of this paragraph 6(e), (A) references to a rate being "permanently discontinued" shall be deemed to be references to such rate being permanently discontinued following a public statement or publication of information which would constitute an Index Cessation Event in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) of the definition thereof in respect of that rate in the relevant tenor, (B) references to the "Relevant LIBOR" in the definition of "Non-Representative" shall be deemed to be references to the relevant tenor of the Relevant LIBOR and (C) Section 7.9(a), 8.5 and 8.6 of the 2006 ISDA Definitions shall be construed in accordance with Sections 7.3(r) and 7.3(s) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions;

(f) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing and the determination for which the Relevant IBOR is required is ordinarily made by reference to linear interpolation between two rates, each of which is based on the Relevant IBOR, then (notwithstanding paragraph 6(d) above) the provisions of Section 7.10(a) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions shall be deemed to apply, provided that the Calculation Agent shall make such adaptations as are reasonable and necessary to the provisions of Section 7.10(a) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions in order to apply them to the relevant Protocol Covered Document.

For the purposes of this paragraph 6(f), Section 7.10(a) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions shall be construed in accordance with Sections 7.3(r) and 7.3(s) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions;

(g) If (i) the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing and the Applicable Fallback Rate is Fallback Rate (SOR) or Fallback Rate (THBFIX), as applicable, (ii) the determination for which the Relevant IBOR is required is not ordinarily made by reference to linear interpolation between two rates and (iii) the period of time for which the rate is required (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be the "Calculation Period") is shorter than the Relevant IBOR in the relevant tenor (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be the "Designated Maturity"), then (notwithstanding paragraph 6(d) above) the provisions of Section 7.11(a) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions shall be deemed to apply, provided that the Calculation Agent shall make such adaptations as are reasonable and necessary to the provisions of Section 7.11(a) of the 2006 ISDA Definitions in order to apply them to the relevant Protocol Covered Document; and

(h) If the definition, methodology, formula or other means of calculating the Relevant IBOR or the Applicable Fallback Rate (or, if applicable, the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the Relevant IBOR or the Applicable Fallback Rate) is modified, each party acknowledges that, unless otherwise specified or agreed, references to that Relevant IBOR or the Applicable Fallback Rate (or the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the Relevant IBOR or the Applicable Fallback Rate) shall be to the Relevant IBOR or the Applicable Fallback Rate (or the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the Relevant IBOR or the Applicable Fallback Rate) as modified. In the event of any inconsistency between this paragraph 6(h) and paragraphs 6(a) through 6(d) above (including any terms used in those paragraphs and defined below and including subparagraphs 6(e)(ii) and 6(e)(iii) above as they apply in priority to paragraph 6(d) above), paragraphs 6(a) through 6(d) above including subparagraphs 6(e)(ii) and 6(e)(iii) as they apply in priority to paragraph 6(d) above shall prevail.
