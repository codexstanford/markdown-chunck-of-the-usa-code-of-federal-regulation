### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Events causing inaccuracies.

1.Subject to § 1026.19(e) and (f), inaccuracies in disclosures are not violations if attributable to events occurring after the disclosures are made. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the collateral insured and the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make the original disclosures inaccurate. The creditor may, however, be required to make new disclosures under § 1026.17(f) or § 1026.19 if the events occurred between disclosure and consummation, in some cases after consummation under § 1026.19(f), or under § 1026.20 if the events occurred after consummation. For rules regarding permissible changes to the information required to be disclosed by § 1026.19(e) and (f), see § 1026.19(e)(3) and (f)(2) and their commentary.
