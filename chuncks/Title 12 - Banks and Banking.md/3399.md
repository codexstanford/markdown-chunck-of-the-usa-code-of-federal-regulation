##### Eligibility for an outstanding overall rating.

(ii)(A) An intermediate small bank or savings association that receives an "outstanding" rating on one test and at least "satisfactory" on the other test may receive an assigned overall rating of "outstanding."

(B) A small bank or savings association that is not an intermediate small bank or savings association that meets each of the standards for a "satisfactory" rating under the lending test and exceeds some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of "outstanding." In assessing whether a bank's or savings association's performance is "outstanding," the appropriate Federal banking agency considers the extent to which the bank or savings association exceeds each of the performance standards for a "satisfactory" rating and its performance in making qualified investments and its performance in providing branches and other services and delivery systems that enhance credit availability in its assessment area(s).
