##### Interpretations
###### ยง 221.110 Questions arising under this part.
####### Loan to acquire controlling shares.

(2)(i) The second question is whether this part governs a margin stock-secured loan made for the business purpose of purchasing a controlling interest in a corporation, or whether such a loan would be exempt on the ground that this part is directed solely toward purchases of stock for speculative or investment purposes. The Board answered that a margin stock-secured loan for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock is subject to this part, regardless of the reason for which the purchase is made.

(ii) The answer is required, in the Board's view, since the language of this part is explicitly inclusive, covering "any purpose credit, secured directly or indirectly by margin stock." Moreover, the withdrawal in 1945 of the original section 2(e) of this part, which exempted "any loan for the purpose of purchasing a stock from or through a person who is not a member of a national securities exchange . . ." plainly implies that transactions of the sort described are now subject to the general prohibition of ยง 221.3(a).
