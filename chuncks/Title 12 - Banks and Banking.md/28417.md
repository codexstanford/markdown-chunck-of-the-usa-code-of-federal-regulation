###### ยง 617.7410 When and how does a qualified lender notify a borrower of the right to seek loan restructuring?
####### Does the borrower have the opportunity to meet with the qualified lender after receiving the restructure notice?

(f)The qualified lender must provide any borrower to whom a notice has been sent with a reasonable opportunity to meet personally with a representative of the lender. The borrower and lender may meet to review the status of the loan, the financial condition of the borrower, and the suitability of the loan for restructuring. A meeting to discuss a loan that is in a non-interest-earning status may also involve developing a plan for restructuring, if the qualified lender determines the loan is suitable for restructuring.
