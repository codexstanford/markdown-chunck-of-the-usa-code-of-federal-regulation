##### Settlement agent responsibilities.

2.If a settlement agent provides any disclosure under § 1026.19(f), the settlement agent must comply with the relevant requirements of § 1026.19(f). For example, if the creditor and settlement agent agree that the creditor will deliver the disclosures required under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) to be received by the consumer three business days before consummation, pursuant to § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A), and that the settlement agent will deliver any corrected disclosures at or before consummation, including disclosures provided so that they are received by the consumer three business days before consummation under § 1026.19(f)(2)(ii), and will permit the consumer to inspect the disclosures during the business day before consummation, the settlement agent must ensure that the consumer receives the disclosures required under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) at or before consummation and is able to inspect the disclosures during the business day before consummation, if the consumer so requests, in accordance with § 1026.19(f)(2)(i). See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-3 below for additional guidance regarding the creditor's responsibilities where the settlement agent provides disclosures. The settlement agent may assume the responsibility to provide some or all of the disclosures required by § 1026.19(f). See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-4 for guidance on how creditors and settlement agents may divide responsibilities for completing the disclosures.
