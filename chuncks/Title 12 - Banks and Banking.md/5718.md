##### ยง 150.70 Must I obtain OCC approval or file a notice before I exercise fiduciary powers?

Except for fiduciary activities subject solely to subpart E, you should refer to 12 CFR 5.26 to determine if you must obtain OCC approval or file a notice with the OCC before you exercise fiduciary powers.
