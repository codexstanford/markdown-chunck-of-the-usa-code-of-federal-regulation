#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Relationship to § 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D).

2.A card issuer that has complied with the disclosure requirements in § 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D) has also complied with the disclosure requirements in § 1026.55(b)(5)(i). See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-10. Thus, although the disclosures required by § 1026.55(b)(5)(i) must generally be provided in writing prior to commencement of the arrangement, a card issuer may comply with § 1026.55(b)(5)(i) by complying with § 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D), which states that the disclosure of the terms of the arrangement may be made orally by telephone, provided that the card issuer mails or delivers a written disclosure of the terms of the arrangement to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable after the oral disclosure is provided.
