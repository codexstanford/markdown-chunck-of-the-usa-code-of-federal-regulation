#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Multifeatured plans.

3.In a multifeatured plan, the creditor must disclose a separate balance (or balances, as applicable) to which a periodic rate was applied for each feature. Separate balances are not required, however, merely because a grace period is available for some features but not others. A total balance for the entire plan is optional. This does not affect how many balances the creditor must disclose-or may disclose-within each feature. (See, for example, comments 7(b)(5)-4 and 7(b)(4)-5.)
