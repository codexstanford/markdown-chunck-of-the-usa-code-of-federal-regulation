###### Other dwelling-secured obligations.

3.For purposes of ยง 226.34(a)(4), current obligations include another credit obligation of which the creditor has knowledge undertaken prior to or at consummation of the transaction and secured by the same dwelling that secures the transaction subject to ยง 226.32 or ยง 226.35. For example, where a transaction subject to ยง 226.35 is a first-lien transaction for the purchase of a home, a creditor must consider a "piggyback" second-lien transaction of which it has knowledge that is used to finance part of the down payment on the house.
