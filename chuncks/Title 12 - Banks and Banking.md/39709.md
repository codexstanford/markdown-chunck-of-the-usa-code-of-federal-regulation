##### Measuring odd periods.

2.i. In determining whether a transaction may take advantage of the rule in § 1026.17(c)(4), the creditor must measure the variation against a regular period. For purposes of that rule:

A. The first period is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the first payment.

B. The term is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the final payment.

C. The regular period is the most common interval between payments in the transaction.

ii. In transactions involving regular periods that are monthly, semimonthly or multiples of a month, the length of the irregular and regular periods may be calculated on the basis of either the actual number of days or an assumed 30-day month. In other transactions, the length of the periods is based on the actual number of days.
