1.Agreements submitted to the Board must contain the provisions of the agreement and pricing information in effect as of the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter. For example, on June 1, a card issuer decides to decrease the purchase APR associated with one of the agreements it offers to the public. The change in the APR will become effective on August 1. If the card issuer submits the agreement to the Board on July 31 (for example, because the agreement has been otherwise amended), the agreement submitted should not include the new lower APR because that APR was not in effect on June 30, the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter.
