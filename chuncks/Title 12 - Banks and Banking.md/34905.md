3.If an insured institution in the prior calendar year did not exceed the 1,000-transfer threshold to a particular country pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(4)(i)(C), but does exceed the 1,000-transfer threshold in the current calendar year, the insured institution has a reasonable amount of time after exceeding the 1,000-transfer threshold to begin providing exact exchange rates in disclosures (assuming it cannot rely on another exception in § 1005.32 to estimate the exchange rate). The reasonable amount of time must not exceed the later of six months after exceeding the 1,000-transfer threshold in the current calendar year or January 1 of the next year. For example, assume an insured institution did not exceed the 1,000-transfer threshold to a particular country pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(4)(i)(C) in 2020, but does exceed the 1,000-transfer threshold on December 1, 2021. The insured institution would have a reasonable amount of time after December 1, 2021 to begin providing exact exchange rates in disclosures (assuming it cannot rely on another exception in § 1005.32 to estimate the exchange rate). In this case, the reasonable amount of time must not exceed June 1, 2022 (which is six months after the insured institution exceeds the 1,000-transfer threshold in the previous year).
