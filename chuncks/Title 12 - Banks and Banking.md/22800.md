####### § 324.145 Recognition of credit risk mitigants for securitization exposures.
######## Collateral,Rules of recognition.

(b)-(1)An FDIC-supervised institution may recognize financial collateral in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure (other than a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, or an OTC derivative contract for which the FDIC-supervised institution has reflected collateral in its determination of exposure amount under § 324.132) as follows. The FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for the collateralized securitization exposure is equal to the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure as calculated under the SSFA in § 324.144 or under the SFA in § 324.143 multiplied by the ratio of adjusted exposure amount (SE*) to original exposure amount (SE), where:

(i) SE* equals max {0, [SE - C x (1- H- H)]};

(ii) SE equals the amount of the securitization exposure calculated under § 324.142(e);

(iii) C equals the current fair value of the collateral;

(iv) Hequals the haircut appropriate to the collateral type; and

(v) Hequals the haircut appropriate for any currency mismatch between the collateral and the exposure.
