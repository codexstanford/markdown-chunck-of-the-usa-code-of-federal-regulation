3.Except as provided in § 226.55(b)(3)(iii), § 226.55(b)(3) permits a card issuer to increase a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) after complying with the applicable notice requirements in § 226.9(b) or (c), provided that the increased fee or charge is not applied to a protected balance. To the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(3)(iii), a card issuer is not prohibited from increasing a fee or charge that applies to the account as a whole or to balances other than the protected balance. For example, after the first year following account opening, a card issuer generally may add or increase an annual or a monthly maintenance fee for an account after complying with the notice requirements in § 226.9(c), including notifying the consumer of the right to reject the new or increased fee under § 226.9(h). However, except as otherwise provided in § 226.55(b), an increased fee or charge cannot be applied to an account while the account is closed or while the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions.§ 226.55(b)(3)(iii);§§ 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)() and 226.55(d)(1). Furthermore, if the consumer rejects an increase in a fee or charge pursuant to § 226.9(h), the card issuer is prohibited from applying the increased fee or charge to the account and from imposing any other fee or charge solely as a result of the rejection.§ 226.9(h)(2)(i) and (ii); comment 9(h)(2)(ii)-2.
