###### Alternative modified look-through approach.

(4)Under the alternative modified look-through approach, a credit union may assign the credit union's exposure amount to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under subpart A of this part based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the credit union's exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the exposure amount assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the credit union must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the credit union must use the highest applicable risk weight. A credit union may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.
