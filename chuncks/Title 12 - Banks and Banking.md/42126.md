#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Authorization not required for every transaction.

1.The prepaid account issuer is not required to receive an authorization request for each transaction to comply with § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A). Nonetheless, the prepaid account issuer generally must establish an authorization policy as described in § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) and have reasonable practices in place to comply with its established policy with respect to the authorization requests it receives. In that case, a prepaid account issuer is deemed to satisfy § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) even if a negative balance results on the prepaid account when a transaction is settled.
