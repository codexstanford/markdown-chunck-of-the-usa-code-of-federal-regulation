(2)(i) A Board-regulated institution that purchases a guarantee or OTC credit derivative (other than an n-to-default credit derivative) that is recognized under § 217.45 as a credit risk mitigant (including via collateral recognized under § 217.37) is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under § 217.31, in accordance with 34(c).
