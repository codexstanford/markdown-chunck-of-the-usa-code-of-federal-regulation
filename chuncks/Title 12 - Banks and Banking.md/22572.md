######## Operational risk quantification systems.

(3)(i) The FDIC-supervised institution's operational risk quantification systems:

(A) Must generate estimates of the FDIC-supervised institution's operational risk exposure using its operational risk data and assessment systems;

(B) Must employ a unit of measure that is appropriate for the FDIC-supervised institution's range of business activities and the variety of operational loss events to which it is exposed, and that does not combine business activities or operational loss events with demonstrably different risk profiles within the same loss distribution;

(C) Must include a credible, transparent, systematic, and verifiable approach for weighting each of the four elements, described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, that an FDIC-supervised institution is required to incorporate into its operational risk data and assessment systems;

(D) May use internal estimates of dependence among operational losses across and within units of measure if the FDIC-supervised institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC that its process for estimating dependence is sound, robust to a variety of scenarios, and implemented with integrity, and allows for uncertainty surrounding the estimates. If the FDIC-supervised institution has not made such a demonstration, it must sum operational risk exposure estimates across units of measure to calculate its total operational risk exposure; and

(E) Must be reviewed and updated (as appropriate) whenever the FDIC-supervised institution becomes aware of information that may have a material effect on the FDIC-supervised institution's estimate of operational risk exposure, but the review and update must occur no less frequently than annually.

(ii) With the prior written approval of the FDIC, an FDIC-supervised institution may generate an estimate of its operational risk exposure using an alternative approach to that specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. An FDIC-supervised institution proposing to use such an alternative operational risk quantification system must submit a proposal to the FDIC. In determining whether to approve an FDIC-supervised institution's proposal to use an alternative operational risk quantification system, the FDIC will consider the following principles:

(A) Use of the alternative operational risk quantification system will be allowed only on an exception basis, considering the size, complexity, and risk profile of the FDIC-supervised institution;

(B) The FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate that its estimate of its operational risk exposure generated under the alternative operational risk quantification system is appropriate and can be supported empirically; and

(C) An FDIC-supervised institution must not use an allocation of operational risk capital requirements that includes entities other than depository institutions or the benefits of diversification across entities.
