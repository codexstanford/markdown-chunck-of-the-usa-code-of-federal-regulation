###### Activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions.

(f)In assessing and taking into account the record of a nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned bank or savings association under this part, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers as a factor capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by the bank or savings association in cooperation with minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions. Such activities must help meet the credit needs of local communities in which the minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions are chartered. To be considered, such activities need not also benefit the bank's or savings association's assessment area(s) or the broader statewide or regional area(s) that includes the bank's or savings association's assessment area(s).
