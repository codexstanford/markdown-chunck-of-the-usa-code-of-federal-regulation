####### Seller dissolution option.

(i)-(1) Mortgages acquired through transactions involving seller dissolution options will be treated as mortgage purchases only when:

(ii) The transaction is not dissolved during the one-year minimum lockout period.

(2) FHFA may grant an exception to the one-year minimum lockout period described in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (i)(1)(ii) of this section, in response to a written request from an Enterprise, if FHFA determines that the transaction furthers the purposes of the Enterprise's Charter Act and the Safety and Soundness Act.

(3) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, "seller dissolution option" means an option for a seller of mortgages to the Enterprises to dissolve or otherwise cancel a mortgage purchase agreement or loan sale.
