###### Default of a material obligation.

8.Creditors may specify events that would qualify as a default of a material obligation under ยง 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C). For example, a creditor may provide that default of a material obligation will exist if the consumer moves out of the dwelling or permits an intervening lien to be filed that would take priority over future advances made by the creditor.
