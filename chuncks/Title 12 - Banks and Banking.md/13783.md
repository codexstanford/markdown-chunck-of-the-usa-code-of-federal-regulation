###### Timely statement of balance.

3.A card issuer must disclose the balance on a deceased consumer's account, upon request by the administrator of the decedent's estate. A card issuer may provide the amount, if any, by a written statement or by telephone. This does not preclude a card issuer from providing the balance amount to appropriate persons, other than the administrator, such as the spouse or a relative of the decedent, who indicate that they may pay any balance. This provision does not relieve card issuers of the requirements to provide a periodic statement, under ยง 226.5(b)(2). A periodic statement, under ยง 226.5(b)(2), may satisfy the requirements of ยง 226.11(c)(2), if provided within 30 days of receiving a request by an administrator of the estate.
