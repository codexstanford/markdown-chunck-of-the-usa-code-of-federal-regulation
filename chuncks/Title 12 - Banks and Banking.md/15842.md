Section 229.20(c)(2) of Regulation CC provides that inconsistency may exist when a state law provides for disclosures or notices concerning funds availability relating to accounts. California Financial Code ยง 866.2 requires disclosures that differ from those required by Regulation CC and, therefore, is preempted to the extent that it applies toas defined in Regulation CC. The state law continues to apply to savings accounts and other accounts not governed by Regulation CC disclosure requirements.
