### PART 1005-ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS (REGULATION E)
#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### 1. Amount received.

The remittance transfer provider is required to disclose the amount that will be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which the funds will be received. The amount received must reflect the exchange rate, all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, as well as any covered third-party fees required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax-except for a non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider-that is imposed on the remittance transfer that affects the amount received even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.
