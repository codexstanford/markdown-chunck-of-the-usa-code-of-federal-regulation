(2)(i) An FDIC-supervised institution's wholesale obligor is in default if:

(B) The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation(s) to the FDIC-supervised institution.

(ii) An obligor in default remains in default until the FDIC-supervised institution has reasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest payments on all exposures of the FDIC-supervised institution to the obligor (other than exposures that have been fully written-down or charged-off).
