###### Periodic rates.

3.No explicit tolerance exists for any periodic rate as such; a disclosed periodic rate may vary from precise accuracy (for example, due to rounding) only to the extent that its annualized equivalent is within the tolerance permitted by ยง 226.14(a). Further, a periodic rate need not be calculated to any particular number of decimal places.
