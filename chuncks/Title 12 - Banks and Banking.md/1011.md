Except as provided in ยง 3.210(b)(2)(vii)(D) for n-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization positions that arewith the position (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization positions that are not resecuritization positions and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization positions.
