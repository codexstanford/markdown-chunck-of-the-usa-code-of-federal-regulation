######## Full look-through approach.

(b)An FDIC-supervised institution that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart as if the proportional ownership share of the adjusted carrying value of each exposure were held directly by the FDIC-supervised institution) may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:

(1) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the FDIC-supervised institution; and

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution's proportional ownership share of the fund.
