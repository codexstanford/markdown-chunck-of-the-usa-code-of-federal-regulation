##### Retainable disclosures.

1.Section 1005.18(b)(6)(ii) requires that, except for disclosures provided orally pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) or (iii), long form disclosures provided via SMS as permitted by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) for a prepaid account sold at retail locations pursuant to the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), and the disclosure of a purchase price pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5) that is not disclosed on the exterior of the packaging material for a prepaid account sold at a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.18(b) must be made in a form that a consumer may keep. For example, a short form disclosure with a tear strip running though it would not be deemed retainable because use of the tear strip to gain access to the prepaid account access device inside the packaging would destroy part of the short form disclosure. Electronic disclosures are deemed retainable if the consumer is able to print, save, and email the disclosures from the Web site or mobile application on which they are displayed.
