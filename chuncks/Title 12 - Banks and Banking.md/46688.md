####### Pledge of advances collateral by affiliates.

(g)Assets held by an affiliate of a member that are eligible as collateral under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section may be used to secure advances to that member only if:

(1) The collateral is pledged to secure either:

(i) The member's obligation to repay advances; or

(ii) A surety or other agreement under which the affiliate has assumed, along with the member, a primary obligation to repay advances made to the member; and

(2) The Bank obtains and maintains a legally enforceable security interest pursuant to which the Bank's legal rights and privileges with respect to the collateral are functionally equivalent in all material respects to those that the Bank would possess if the member were to pledge the same collateral directly, and such functional equivalence is supported by adequate documentation.
