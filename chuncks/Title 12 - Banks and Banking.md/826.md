##### Risk-Weighted Assets for Equity Exposures
###### § 3.151 Introduction and exposure measurement.
####### General.

(a)(1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to investment funds, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply either the Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA) in § 3.152 or, if it qualifies to do so, the Internal Models Approach (IMA) in § 3.153. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the look-through approaches provided in § 3.154 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.

(2) A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 3.2), as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 3.154.
