###### Changes in fees.

6.If a creditor is changing part of how a fee that is disclosed in a tabular format under ยง 226.6(b)(1) and (b)(2) is determined, the creditor must redisclose all relevant information related to that fee regardless of whether this other information is changing. For example, if a creditor currently charges a cash advance fee of "Either $5 or 3% of the transaction amount, whichever is greater. (Max: $100)," and the creditor is only changing the minimum dollar amount from $5 to $10, the issuer must redisclose the other information related to how the fee is determined. For example, the creditor in this example would disclose the following: "Either $10 or 3% of the transaction amount, whichever is greater. (Max: $100)."
