###### Optional "disposition" charges.

6.Disposition and similar charges that are anticipated by the parties as an incident to the normal operation of the lease agreement must be disclosed under ยง 213.4(d). If, under a lease agreement, a lessee may return leased property to various locations, and the lessor charges a disposition fee depending upon the location chosen, under ยง 213.4(d), the lessor must disclose the highest amount charged. In such circumstances, the lessor may also include a brief explanation of the fee structure in the segregated disclosure. For example, if no fee or a lower fee is imposed for returning a leased vehicle to the originating dealer as opposed to another location, that fact may be disclosed. By contrast, if the terms of the lease treat the return of the leased property to a location outside the lessor's service area as a default, the fee imposed is not disclosed as an "other charge," although it may be required to be disclosed under ยง 213.4(q).
