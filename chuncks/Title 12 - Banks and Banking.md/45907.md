####### Protection purchaser,First-to-default credit derivatives.

(4)-(i)An Enterprise that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 1240.38(b) must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the Enterprise synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. An Enterprise must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 1240.36 for a first-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 1240.38(b).
