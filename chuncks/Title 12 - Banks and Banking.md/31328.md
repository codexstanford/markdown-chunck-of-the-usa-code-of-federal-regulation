###### Minimum balance accounts.

4.A requirement to maintain a minimum balance to earn dividends does not make an account a tiered-rate account. If dividends are not paid on amounts below a specified balance level, then the account has a minimum balance requirement (required to be disclosed under ยง 707.4(b)(3)(i)), but the account does not constitute a tiered-rate account. A zero rate (0%) cannot constitute a tier. Minimum balance accounts are single rate accounts with a minimum balance requirement.
