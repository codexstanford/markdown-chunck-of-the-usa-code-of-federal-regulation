### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Inapplicability of closed-end rules.

8.Advertisements for home-equity plans are governed solely by the requirements in § 1026.16, except § 1026.16(g), and not by the closed-end advertising rules in § 1026.24. Thus, if a creditor states payment information about the repayment phase, this will trigger the duty to provide additional information under § 1026.16, but not under § 1026.24.
