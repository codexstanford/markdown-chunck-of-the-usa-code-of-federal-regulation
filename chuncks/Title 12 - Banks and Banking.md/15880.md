###### Next-day availability.

Under the Wisconsin statute, the proceeds of state and local government checks must be made available for withdrawal by the second day following deposit, if the check is endorsed only by the person to whom it was issued (Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m)(b)(1); 215.136(2)(b); and 186.117(2)(a)). Regulation CC requires next-day availability for these checks if they are (1) deposited in an account of a payee of the check, (2) deposited in a depositary bank located in the same state as the state or local government that issued the check, (3) deposited in person to an employee of the depositary bank, and (4) deposited with a special deposit slip, if the depositary bank informed its customers that use of such a slip is a condition to next-day availability. Under the Federal law, if a state or local government check is not deposited in person to an employee of the depositary bank, but meets the other conditions set forth in ยง 229.10(c)(1)(iv), the funds must be made available for withdrawal not later than the second business day following deposit. The Wisconsin statute supersedes Regulation CC to the extent that the state law does not permit the use of a special deposit slip as a condition to receipt of second-day availability.
