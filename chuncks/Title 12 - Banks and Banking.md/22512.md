######## Protection purchaser.

(2)(i) An FDIC-supervised institution that purchases a guarantee or OTC credit derivative (other than an nth-to-default credit derivative) that is recognized under § 324.45 as a credit risk mitigant (including via collateral recognized under § 324.37) is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under § 324.31, in accordance with § 324.34(c).

(ii) If an FDIC-supervised institution cannot, or chooses not to, recognize a purchased credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant under § 324.45, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine the exposure amount of the credit derivative under § 324.34.

(A) If the FDIC-supervised institution purchases credit protection from a counterparty that is not a securitization SPE, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to this subpart D.

(B) If the FDIC-supervised institution purchases the credit protection from a counterparty that is a securitization SPE, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to section § 324.42, including § 324.42(a)(4) for a credit derivative that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures of the securitization SPE (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments).
