##### Multiple applicants.

5.When two or more consumers apply for an extension of credit as joint obligors with primary liability on an obligation, § 1026.43(c)(2)(i) does not require the creditor to consider income or assets that are not needed to support the creditor's repayment ability determination. If the income or assets of one applicant are sufficient to support the creditor's repayment ability determination, the creditor is not required to consider the income or assets of the other applicant. For example, if a husband and wife jointly apply for a loan and the creditor reasonably determines that the wife's income is sufficient to repay the loan, the creditor is not required to consider the husband's income.
