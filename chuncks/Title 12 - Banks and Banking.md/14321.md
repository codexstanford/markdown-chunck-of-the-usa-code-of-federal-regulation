##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Example.

1.If a creditor improperly omits a $75 fee from the finance charge on a regular transaction, the understated finance charge is considered accurate under ยง 226.18(d)(1), and the annual percentage rate corresponding to that understated finance charge also is considered accurate even if it falls outside the tolerance ofof 1 percentage point provided under ยง 226.22(a)(2). Because a $75 error was made, an annual percentage rate corresponding to a $100 understatement of the finance charge would not be considered accurate.
