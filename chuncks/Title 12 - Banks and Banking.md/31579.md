####### Applicability of State law.

(a)While NCUA's merger rules apply to all mergers of Federally insured credit unions, Federally insured state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs) are also subject to State law on mergers. NCUA's position is that no merger of a State chartered credit union is authorized unless permitted by State law, and also that a State legislature or State supervisory authority may impose merger requirements more stringent or restrictive than NCUA's. States that permit mergers may have substantive and procedural requirements that vary from Federal law. For example, there may be different voting standards for approving a vote. While the Federal Credit Union Act requires a simple majority of those who vote to approve a merger, some States have higher voting standards requiring two-thirds or more of those who vote. A FISCU should be careful to understand both Federal and State law to navigate the merger process and conduct a proper vote.
