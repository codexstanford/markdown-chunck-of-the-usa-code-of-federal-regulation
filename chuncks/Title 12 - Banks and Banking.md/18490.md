####### Qualitative disclosures.

(d)(1) A covered depository institution holding company, U.S. intermediate holding company, or covered nonbank company must provide a qualitative discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its net stable funding ratio, which may include the following:

(i) The main drivers of the net stable funding ratio;

(ii) Changes in the net stable funding ratio results over time and the causes of such changes (for example, changes in strategies and circumstances);

(iii) Concentrations of funding sources and changes in funding structure; or

(iv) Concentrations of available and required stable funding within a covered company's corporate structure (for example, across legal entities).

(2) If a covered depository institution holding company, U.S. intermediate holding company, or covered nonbank company subject to this subpart believes that the qualitative discussion required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section would prejudice seriously its position by resulting in public disclosure of specific commercial or financial information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the covered depository institution holding company, U.S. intermediate holding company, or covered nonbank company is not required to include those specific items in its qualitative discussion, but must provide more general information about the items that had a significant effect on its net stable funding ratio, together with the fact that, and the reason why, more specific information was not discussed.
