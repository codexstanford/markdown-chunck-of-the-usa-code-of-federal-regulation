## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Creditors, assignees, and servicers.

1.Creditors, assignees, and servicers that own either the applicable adjustable-rate mortgage or the applicable mortgage servicing rights or both are subject to the requirements of § 1026.20(d). Creditors, assignees, and servicers are also subject to the requirements of any provision of subpart C that governs § 1026.20(d). For example, the form requirements of § 1026.17(a) apply to § 1026.20(d) disclosures and thus, assignees and servicers, as well as creditors, are subject to those requirements. While creditors, assignees, and servicers are all subject to the requirements of § 1026.20(d), they may decide among themselves which of them will provide the required disclosures.
