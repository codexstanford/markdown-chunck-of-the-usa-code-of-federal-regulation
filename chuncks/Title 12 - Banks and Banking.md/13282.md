###### Noncoverage of consumer-initiated requests.

1.Applications provided to a consumer upon request are not covered by § 226.5a, even if the request is made in response to the card issuer's invitation to apply for a card account. To illustrate, if a card issuer invites consumers to call a toll-free number or to return a response card to obtain an application, the application sent in response to the consumer's request need not contain the disclosures required under § 226.5a. Similarly, if the card issuer invites consumers to call and make an oral application on the telephone, § 226.5a does not apply to the application made by the consumer. If, however, the card issuer calls a consumer or initiates a telephone discussion with a consumer about opening a card account and contemporaneously takes an oral application, such applications are subject to § 226.5a, specifically § 226.5a(d). Likewise, if the card issuer initiates an in-person discussion with a consumer about opening a card account and contemporaneously takes an application, such applications are subject to § 226.5a, specifically § 226.5a(f).
