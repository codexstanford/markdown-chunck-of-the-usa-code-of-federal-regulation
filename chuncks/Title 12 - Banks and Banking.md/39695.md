#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Growth-equity mortgages.

13.i. Also referred to as payment-escalated mortgages, these mortgage plans involve scheduled payment increases to prematurely amortize the loan. The initial payment amount is determined as for a long-term loan with a fixed interest rate. Payment increases are scheduled periodically, based on changes in an index. The larger payments result in accelerated amortization of the loan. In disclosing these mortgage plans, creditors may either:

A. Estimate the amount of payment increases, based on the best information reasonably available; or

B. Disclose by analogy to the variable-rate disclosures in 1026.18(f)(1).

ii. This discussion does not apply to growth-equity mortgages in which the amount of payment increases can be accurately determined at the time of disclosure. For these mortgages, as for graduated-payment mortgages, disclosures should reflect the scheduled increases in payments.
