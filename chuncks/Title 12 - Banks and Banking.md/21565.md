####### General rule.

(a)An eligible applicant who, following an adversary adjudication has gained victory on the merits in the proceeding is a "prevailing party". An eligible applicant may be a "prevailing party" if a settlement of the proceeding was effected on terms favorable to it or if the proceeding against it has been dismissed. In appropriate situations an applicant may also have prevailed if the outcome of the proceeding has substantially vindicated the applicant's position on the significant substantive matters at issue, even though the applicant has not totally avoided adverse final action.
