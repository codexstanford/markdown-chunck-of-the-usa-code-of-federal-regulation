3.The following are examples of items that arebonuses:

i. Discount coupons distributed by credit unions for use at restaurants or stores.

ii. A credit union offers $20 to any member if the member is responsible for encouraging a potential member to open an account. The $20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening the account. Any item, including cash, given or offered to a third party (that is not a joint member or joint owner in an account being opened) in exchange for a member or potential member opening (or a member renewing or adding to) an account is not a bonus.

iii. A credit union offers $25 to a member if the member can locate his name in the body of a newsletter.

iv. Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members. Because the benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are not bonuses.

v. A credit union offers to pay annual membership dues in a benevolent organization for a class of members.
