#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Downpayments.

1.A downpayment is defined in § 1026.2(a)(18) to include, at the creditor's option, certain deferred downpayments or pick-up payments. A deferred downpayment that meets the criteria set forth in the definition may be treated as part of the downpayment, at the creditor's option.

i. Deferred downpayments that are not treated as part of the downpayment (either because they do not meet the definition or because the creditor simply chooses not to treat them as downpayments) are included in the amount financed.

ii. Deferred downpayments that are treated as part of the downpayment are not part of the amount financed under § 1026.18(b)(1).
