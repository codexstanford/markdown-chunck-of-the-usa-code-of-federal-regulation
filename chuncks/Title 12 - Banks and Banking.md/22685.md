######## Prior approval relating to EAD calculation.

(3)To obtain FDIC approval to calculate the distributions of exposures upon which the EAD calculation is based, the FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC that it has been using for at least one year an internal model that broadly meets the following minimum standards, with which the FDIC-supervised institution must maintain compliance:

(i) The model must have the systems capability to estimate the expected exposure to the counterparty on a daily basis (but is not expected to estimate or report expected exposure on a daily basis);

(ii) The model must estimate expected exposure at enough future dates to reflect accurately all the future cash flows of contracts in the netting set;

(iii) The model must account for the possible non-normality of the exposure distribution, where appropriate;

(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution must measure, monitor, and control current counterparty exposure and the exposure to the counterparty over the whole life of all contracts in the netting set;

(v) The FDIC-supervised institution must be able to measure and manage current exposures gross and net of collateral held, where appropriate. The FDIC-supervised institution must estimate expected exposures for OTC derivative contracts both with and without the effect of collateral agreements;

(vi) The FDIC-supervised institution must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control wrong-way risk throughout the life of an exposure. The procedures must include stress testing and scenario analysis;

(vii) The model must use current market data to compute current exposures. The FDIC-supervised institution must estimate model parameters using historical data from the most recent three-year period and update the data quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. The FDIC-supervised institution should consider using model parameters based on forward-looking measures, where appropriate;

(viii) When estimating model parameters based on a stress period, the FDIC-supervised institution must use at least three years of historical data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the FDIC-supervised institution's counterparties. The FDIC-supervised institution must review the data set and update the data as necessary, particularly for any material changes in its counterparties. The FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, and maintain documentation of such demonstration, that the stress period coincides with increased CDS or other credit spreads of the FDIC-supervised institution's counterparties. The FDIC-supervised institution must have procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration that include a process for using benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same risk factors as the FDIC-supervised institution's portfolio. The FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to modify its stress calibration to better reflect actual historic losses of the portfolio;

(ix) An FDIC-supervised institution must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process. The model review should consider whether the inputs and risk factors, as well as the model outputs, are appropriate. As part of the model review process, the FDIC-supervised institution must have a backtesting program for its model that includes a process by which unacceptable model performance will be determined and remedied;

(x) An FDIC-supervised institution must have policies for the measurement, management and control of collateral and margin amounts; and

(xi) An FDIC-supervised institution must have a comprehensive stress testing program that captures all credit exposures to counterparties, and incorporates stress testing of principal market risk factors and creditworthiness of counterparties.
