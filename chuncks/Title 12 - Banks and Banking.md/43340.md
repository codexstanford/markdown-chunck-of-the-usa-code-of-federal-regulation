### PART 1081-RULES OF PRACTICE FOR ADJUDICATION PROCEEDINGS
#### Subpart B-Initiation of Proceedings and Prehearing Rules
##### § 1081.201 Answer and disclosure statement and notification of financial interest.
###### Default.

(d)(1) Failure of a respondent to file an answer within the time provided will be deemed to constitute a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations of the notice of charges and to authorize the hearing officer, without further notice to the respondent, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of charges and to enter preliminary findings and conclusions containing appropriate findings and conclusions. In such cases, respondent will have no right to appeal pursuant to § 1081.402, but must instead proceed pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(2) A motion to set aside a default must be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate, the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of the preliminary findings and conclusions, or the Director, at any time, may for good cause shown set aside a default.
