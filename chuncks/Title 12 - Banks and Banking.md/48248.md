#### ยง 1600.1 Standards of ethical conduct.
##### Waivers

(c)-The post-employment restrictions set forth in section 152(g) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may be waived in whole or in part for an employee with limited access to the transaction or position data or business confidential information maintained by the Data Center if-

(1) The Designated Agency Ethics Official, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Financial Research or the Department's General Counsel in instances where consultation with the Director poses a conflict or the Director's position is vacant, determines in writing that such waiver is unlikely to compromise any financial company's business confidential information, unfairly advantage or disadvantage any financial company, or affect the integrity or effectiveness of the Office of Financial Research.

(2) Relevant factors to be considered by the Designated Agency Ethics Official and the Director or General Counsel include-

(i) The nature and importance of the employee's position and the degree to which the employee had access to non-public or business confidential data for the purpose of analysis, standardization, or performing applied research or essential long-term research;

(ii) Whether the information to which the employee had access revealed positions or transactions of an individual financial company;

(iii) Whether the data, especially position data, remains sensitive considering changing circumstances or the passage of time;

(iv) Whether the employee had access to micro-level data, as compared to aggregated information;

(v) If the employee had access to micro-level data, whether it was sufficiently masked or coded to protect the identity of the provider or the subject financial company;

(vi) Whether the information to which the employee had access would provide a financial company employer with a competitive commercial advantage;

(vii) Whether the financial company employer has made a satisfactory representation that it has adopted screening measures which will effectively prevent a potential employee from sharing any transaction or position data or business confidential information acquired at the Office of Financial Research one year prior to accepting employment with the company;

(viii) Whether granting the waiver would affect the willingness of a financial company to continue to provide transaction or position data or business confidential information to the Office; and

(ix) Whether the proposed employment would create an appearance of impropriety or would otherwise adversely affect the interests of the government or compromise the integrity of the office.

(d) The following examples are illustrative of how the OFR post-employment prohibitions would apply under certain circumstances:
