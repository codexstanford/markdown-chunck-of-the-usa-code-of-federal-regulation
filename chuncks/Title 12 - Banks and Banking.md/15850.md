#### PART 229 - AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND COLLECTION OF CHECKS (REGULATION CC)
##### Appendix F to Part 229 - Official Board Interpretations; Preemption Determinations
###### Permanent schedule.

Under the California regulations, credit unions and industrial loan companies must provide next-day availability to first-indorsed items issued by any federally-insured institution. This regulatory requirement, however, has been superseded by section 867 of the California Financial Code, which requires depository institutions to make funds deposited by cashier's check, teller's check, certified check, or depository check available for withdrawal on the second business day following deposit, if certain conditions are met. This requirement became effective January 1, 1988.

The Regulation CC next-day availability requirement for cashier's and teller's checks applies only to those checks issued for remittance purposes. To the extent that the state second business day availability requirement applies to cashier's and teller's checks issued for other than remittance purposes, the state two-day requirement supersedes the federal local and nonlocal schedules.
