#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### General.

1.For loans with a balloon payment, the rules differ depending on whether the loan is a higher-priced covered transaction, as defined under § 1026.43(b)(4), or is not a higher-priced covered transaction because the annual percentage rate does not exceed the applicable threshold calculated using the applicable average prime offer rate (APOR) for a comparable transaction. "Average prime offer rate" is defined in § 1026.35(a)(2); "higher-priced covered transaction" is defined in § 1026.43(b)(4). For higher-priced covered transactions with a balloon payment, the creditor must consider the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on the payment schedule under the terms of the legal obligation, including any required balloon payment. For loans with a balloon payment that are not higher-priced covered transactions, the creditor should use the maximum payment scheduled during the first five years of the loan following the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. "Balloon payment" is defined in § 1026.18(s)(5)(i).
