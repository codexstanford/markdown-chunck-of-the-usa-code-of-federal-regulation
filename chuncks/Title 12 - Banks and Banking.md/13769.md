2.For purposes of ยง 226.10(f), a "material change" means any change in the address for receiving payment or procedures for handling cardholder payments which causes a material delay in the crediting of a payment. "Material delay" means any delay in crediting payment to a consumer's account which would result in a late payment and the imposition of a late fee or finance charge. A delay in crediting a payment which does not result in a late fee or finance charge would be immaterial.
