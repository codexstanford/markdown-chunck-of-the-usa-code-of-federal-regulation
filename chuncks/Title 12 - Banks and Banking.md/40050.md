3.In addition to the disclosures required for interest rate adjustments under an adjustable-rate mortgage, § 1026.20(c) also requires the disclosures for an ARM converting to a fixed-rate transaction when the conversion changes the interest rate and results in a corresponding payment change. When an open-end account converts to a closed-end adjustable-rate mortgage, the § 1026.20(c) disclosure is not required until the implementation of an interest rate adjustment post-conversion that results in a corresponding payment change. For example, for an open-end account that converts to a closed-end 3/1 hybrid ARM,an ARM with a fixed rate of interest for the first three years after which the interest rate adjusts annually, the first § 1026.20(c) disclosure would not be required until three years after the conversion, and only if that first adjustment resulted in a payment change.
