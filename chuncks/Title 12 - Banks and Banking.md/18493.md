####### loan production offices,mortgage company,servicing exemption

(f) The Board noted in its 1967 interpretation that offices that are open to the public and staffed by employees of the bank who regularly engage in soliciting borrowers, negotiating terms, and processing applications for loans (so-called) constitute branches. (1967 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1334.) The Board also noted that later in that year it considered the question whether a bank holding company may acquire the stock of a so-calledon the basis that the company would be engaged in "furnishing services to or performing services for such bank holding company or its banking subsidiaries" (the so-calledof section 4(c)(1)(C) of the Bank Holding Company Act; 12 U.S.C. 1843). In concluding affirmatively, the Board stated that "the appropriate test for determining whether the company may be considered as within the servicing exemption is whether the company will perform as principal any banking activities-such as receiving deposits, paying checks, extending credit, conducting a trust department, and the like. In other words, if the mortgage company is to act merely as an adjunct to a bank for the purpose of facilitating the bank's operations, the company may appropriately be considered as within the scope of the servicing exemption." (1967 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1911; 12 CFR 225.122.)
