###### Dissenters' rights and appraisal procedures.

(iii)(A) Unless the Federal savings association has elected to follow the procedures applicable to State savings associations under paragraph (o)(1)(i)(A), Federal savings association shareholders who dissent from a plan to merge or consolidate may receive in cash the value of their Federal savings association shares if they comply with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 214a as if the Federal savings association were a national bank. The OCC conducts an appraisal or reappraisal of the value of the Federal savings association shares held by dissenting shareholders only if all parties agree that the determination will be final and binding. The parties also must agree on how the total expenses of the OCC in making the appraisal will be divided among the parties and paid to the OCC.

(B) Unless the Federal savings association has elected to follow the procedures applicable to State savings associations under paragraph (o)(1)(i)(A), the plan of merger or consolidation must provide the manner of disposing of the shares of the resulting State institution not taken by the dissenting shareholders of the Federal savings association.
