##### Club accounts.

6.Institutions offering club accounts (such as a "holiday" or "vacation" club) cannot impose a minimum balance requirement for interest based on the total number or dollar amount of payments required under the club plan. For example, if a plan calls for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the institution cannot set a $500 "minimum balance" and then pay interest only if the consumer has made all 50 payments.
