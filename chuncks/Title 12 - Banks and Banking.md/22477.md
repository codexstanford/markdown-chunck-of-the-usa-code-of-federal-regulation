(f)(1) If an FDIC-supervised institution recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative that is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the following formula to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative: Pc = Pr x (1-H), where:

(i) Pc equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for currency mismatch (and maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable);

(ii) Pr equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable); and

(iii) Hequals haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch between the credit risk mitigant and the hedged exposure.
