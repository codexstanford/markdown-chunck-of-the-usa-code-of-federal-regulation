2.The exception contained in § 1026.43(e)(7)(iii)(B)) may be used only one time for a covered transaction. The exceptions contained in § 1026.43(e)(7)(iii)(B)() and () apply not only to an initial sale, assignment, or other transfer by the originating creditor but to subsequent sales, assignments, and other transfers as well. For example, assume Creditor A originates a covered transaction that is not a qualified mortgage at origination. Six months after consummation, the covered transaction is transferred to Creditor B pursuant to § 1026.43(e)(7)(iii)(B)(). The transfer does not fail to comply with the requirements in § 1026.43(e)(7)(iii) because the loan is not securitized as part of the transfer or at any other time before the end of the seasoning period. If Creditor B sells the covered transaction before the end of the seasoning period, the covered transaction is not eligible to season into a qualified mortgage under § 1026.43(e)(7) unless the sale falls within an exception set forth in § 1026.43(e)(7)(iii)(B)() or () (the transfer is required by supervisory action or pursuant to a merger or acquisition).
