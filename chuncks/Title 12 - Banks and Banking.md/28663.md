####### Effect of failure to answer.

(d)Failure of a party to file an answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the party's right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice and authorizes the presiding officer, without further notice to the party, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice and to file with the Board a recommended decision containing such findings and appropriate conclusions. The Board or the presiding officer may, for good cause shown, permit the filing of a delayed answer after the time for filing and the answer has expired.
