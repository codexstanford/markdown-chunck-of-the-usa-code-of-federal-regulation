Other than the provisions of Section 867 discussed above, California law incorporates the Regulation CC availability requirements with respect to deposits to accounts covered by Regulation CC. Because the state requirements are consistent with the federal requirements, the California regulation is not preempted by, nor does it supersede, the federal law.
