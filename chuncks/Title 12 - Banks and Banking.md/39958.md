#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges.

5.In calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges for purposes of conducting the good faith analysis pursuant to § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), the aggregate amount of estimated charges must reflect charges for services that are actually performed. For example, assume that the creditor included a $100 estimated fee for a pest inspection in the disclosures provided pursuant to § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the fee is included in the category of charges subject to § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), but a pest inspection was not obtained in connection with the transaction, then for purposes of the good faith analysis required under § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), the sum of all charges subject to § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) paid by or imposed on the consumer is compared to the sum of all such charges disclosed pursuant to § 1026.19(e), minus the $100 estimated pest inspection fee.
