##### Principal amount.,See

1.The principal amount must equal what the face amount of the note would be as of the time of approval, and it must be labeled "Total Loan Amount."appendix H-18. This amount may be different from the "principal loan amount" used to calculate the amount financed under comment 18(b)(3)-1, because the creditor has the option under that comment of using a "principal loan amount" that is different from the face amount of the note. If the creditor elects to provide an itemization of the amount financed under § 1026.18(c)(1) the creditor need not disclose the amount financed elsewhere.
