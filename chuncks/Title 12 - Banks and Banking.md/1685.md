###### Termination of status.

(4)The national bank or Federal savings association must advise the OCC when the transaction is about to be consummated. Termination of a national bank's or Federal savings association's existence and status as a national banking association or Federal savings association is automatic, and its charter cancelled, upon completion of the statutory and regulatory requirements and consummation of the consolidation or merger. When the national bank or Federal savings association files the notice under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, the OCC provides instructions to the national bank or Federal savings association for terminating its status as a national bank or Federal savings association, including surrendering its charter to the OCC immediately after consummation of the transaction.
