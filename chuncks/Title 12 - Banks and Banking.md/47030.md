####### Independent validation of Bank internal market-risk model or internal cash-flow model.

(c)(1) Each Bank shall conduct an independent validation of its internal market-risk model or internal cash-flow model within the Bank that is carried out by personnel not reporting to the business line responsible for conducting business transactions for the Bank. Alternatively, the Bank may obtain independent validation by an outside party qualified to make such determinations. Validations shall be done periodically, commensurate with the risk associated with the use of the model, or as frequently as required by FHFA.

(2) The results of such independent validations shall be reviewed by the Bank's board of directors and provided promptly to FHFA.
