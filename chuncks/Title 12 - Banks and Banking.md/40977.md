#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Adjustments and other credits.

1.Under § 1026.38(i)(8)(ii), the "Final" amount for "Adjustments and Other Credits" would include, for example, prorations of taxes or homeowner's association fees, utilities used but not paid for by the seller, rent collected in advance by the seller from a tenant for a period extending beyond the consummation, and interest on loan assumptions. This category also includes generalized credits toward closing costs given by parties other than the seller. For additional guidance regarding adjustments and other credits, see commentary to §§ 1026.37(h)(1)(vii) and 1026.38(j)(2)(vi) and (xi). If the calculation required by § 1026.38(i)(8)(ii) yields a negative number, the creditor or closing agent discloses the amount as a negative number.
