(d)Whenever this part of cross referenced provisions of the SEC regulations require disclosure of indebtedness of management, extensions of credit to specified persons in excess of ten (10) percent of the equity capital accounts of the bank or State savings association or $5 million, whichever is less, shall be deemed material and shall be disclosed in addition to any other required disclosure. The disclosure of this material indebtedness shall include the largest aggregate amount of indebtedness (in dollar amounts, and as a percentage of total equity capital accounts at the time), including extensions of credit or overdrafts, endorsements and guarantees outstanding at any time since the beginning of the bank or State savings association's last fiscal year, and as of the latest practicable date.

(2) Other loans are deemed material and shall be disclosed where:

(i) The extension(s) of credit was not made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates, collateral and repayment terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other than the specified persons;

(ii) The extension(s) of credit was not made in the ordinary course of business; or

(iii) The extension(s) of credit has involved or presently involves more than a normal risk of collectibility or other unfavorable features including the restructuring of an extension of credit, or a delinquency as to payment of interest or principal.
