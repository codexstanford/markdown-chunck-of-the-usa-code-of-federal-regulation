###### Date for obtaining disclosed terms.

2.The creditor may disclose either a specific date or a time period for obtaining the disclosed terms. If the creditor discloses a time period, the consumer must be able to determine from the disclosure the specific date by which an application must be submitted to obtain any guaranteed terms. For example, the disclosure might read, "To obtain the following terms, you must submit your application within 60 days after the date appearing on this disclosure," provided the disclosure form also shows the date.
