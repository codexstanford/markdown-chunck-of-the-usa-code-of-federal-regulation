###### Finance charge.

4.The dollar amount of the finance charge or any portion of it includes statements such as:

- "$500 total cost of credit."

- "$2 monthly carrying charge."

- "$50,000 mortgages, 2 points to the borrower."

In the last example, the $1,000 prepaid finance charge can be readily determined from the information given. Statements of the annual percentage rate or statements that there is no particular charge for credit (such as "no closing costs") are not triggering terms under this paragraph.
