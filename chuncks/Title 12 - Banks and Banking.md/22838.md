####### ยง 324.161 Qualification requirements for incorporation of operational risk mitigants.
######## Qualification to use operational risk mitigants.

(a)An FDIC-supervised institution may adjust its estimate of operational risk exposure to reflect qualifying operational risk mitigants if:

(1) The FDIC-supervised institution's operational risk quantification system is able to generate an estimate of the FDIC-supervised institution's operational risk exposure (which does not incorporate qualifying operational risk mitigants) and an estimate of the FDIC-supervised institution's operational risk exposure adjusted to incorporate qualifying operational risk mitigants; and

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution's methodology for incorporating the effects of insurance, if the FDIC-supervised institution uses insurance as an operational risk mitigant, captures through appropriate discounts to the amount of risk mitigation:

(i) The residual term of the policy, where less than one year;

(ii) The cancellation terms of the policy, where less than one year;

(iii) The policy's timeliness of payment;

(iv) The uncertainty of payment by the provider of the policy; and

(v) Mismatches in coverage between the policy and the hedged operational loss event.
