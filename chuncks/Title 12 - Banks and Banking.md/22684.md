(C) &#x3B1; = 1.4 except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, or when the FDIC has determined that the FDIC-supervised institution must set &#x3B1; higher based on the FDIC-supervised institution's specific characteristics of counterparty credit risk or model performance.

(v) An FDIC-supervised institution may include financial collateral currently posted by the counterparty as collateral (but may not include other forms of collateral) when calculating EE.

(vi) If an FDIC-supervised institution hedges some or all of the counterparty credit risk associated with a netting set using an eligible credit derivative, the FDIC-supervised institution may take the reduction in exposure to the counterparty into account when estimating EE. If the FDIC-supervised institution recognizes this reduction in exposure to the counterparty in its estimate of EE, it must also use its internal model to estimate a separate EAD for the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the protection provider of the credit derivative.
