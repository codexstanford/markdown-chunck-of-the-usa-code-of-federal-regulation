#### PART 226-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### i.e.,

The card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Board under ยง 226.58(c)(1). (The card issuer has more than 10,000 open accounts, so the ยง 226.58(c)(5) de minimis exception does not apply. The agreement is offered solely for two different private label credit card plans (one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A and one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B and its affiliates, Merchants C and D), but both of these plans have more than 10,000 open accounts, so the ยง 226.58(c)(6) private label credit card exception does not apply. Finally, the agreement is not offered solely in connection with a product test by the card issuer, so the ยง 226.58(c)(7) product test exception does not apply.)
