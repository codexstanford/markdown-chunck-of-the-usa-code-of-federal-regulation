####### Retail.

(1)(i) A retail exposure of an FDIC-supervised institution is in default if:

(A) The exposure is 180 days past due, in the case of a residential mortgage exposure or revolving exposure;

(B) The exposure is 120 days past due, in the case of retail exposures that are not residential mortgage exposures or revolving exposures; or

(C) The FDIC-supervised institution has taken a full or partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or material negative fair value adjustment of principal on the exposure for credit-related reasons.

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(i) of this definition, for a retail exposure held by a non-U.S. subsidiary of the FDIC-supervised institution that is subject to an internal ratings-based approach to capital adequacy consistent with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework" in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the FDIC-supervised institution may elect to use the definition of default that is used in that jurisdiction, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution has obtained prior approval from the FDIC to use the definition of default in that jurisdiction.

(iii) A retail exposure in default remains in default until the FDIC-supervised institution has reasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest payments on the exposure.
