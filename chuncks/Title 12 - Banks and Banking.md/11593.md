(i)For purposes of the activity limitation, a commercial loan is defined in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision inv.474 U.S. 361 (1986), as a direct loan to a business customer for the purpose of providing funds for that customer's business. In this regard, the Board notes that whether a particular transaction is a commercial loan must be determined not from the face of the instrument, but from the application of the definition of commercial loan in thedecision to that transaction. Thus, certain transactions of the type mentioned in the Board's ruling at issue inand in the Senate and Conference Reports in the CEBA legislationwould be commercial loans if they meet the test for commercial loans established inUnder this test, a commercial loan would not include, for example, an open-market investment in a commercial entity that does not involve a borrower-lender relationship or negotiation of credit terms, such as a money market transaction.
