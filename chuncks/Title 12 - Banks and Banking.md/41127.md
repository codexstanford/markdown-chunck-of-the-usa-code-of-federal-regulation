#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Segregation of disclosures.

3.i. While most of the disclosures must be grouped together and segregated from all unrelated information, the creditor is permitted to include information that explains or expands on the required disclosures, including, for example:

A. Any prepayment penalty.

B. How a substitute index may be chosen.

C. Actions the creditor may take short of terminating and accelerating an outstanding balance.

D. Renewal terms.

E. Rebate of fees.

ii. An example of information that does not explain or expand on the required disclosures and thus cannot be included is the creditor's underwriting criteria, although the creditor could provide such information separately from the required disclosures.
