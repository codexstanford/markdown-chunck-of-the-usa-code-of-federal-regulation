## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Late payment-six months prior to application.

1.Under § 1026.43(d)(2)(v), the exemptions in § 1026.43(d)(3) apply to a covered transaction only if, during the six months immediately preceding the creditor's receipt of the consumer's written application for a refinancing, the consumer has made no payments on the non-standard mortgage more than 30 days late. (For an explanation of "written application" and how to determine the payment due date, see comments 43(d)(2)-1 and 43(d)(2)(iv)-2.) For example, assume a consumer with a non-standard mortgage applies for a refinancing on May 1, 2014. If the consumer made a payment on March 15, 2014, that was 45 days late, the requirement under § 1026.43(d)(2)(v) is not met because the consumer made a payment more than 30 days late one and one-half months prior to application. If the number of months between consummation of the non-standard mortgage and the consumer's application for the standard mortgage is six or fewer, the consumer may not have made any payment more than 30 days late on the non-standard mortgage.
