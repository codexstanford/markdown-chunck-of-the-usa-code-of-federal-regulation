##### Disclosure of multiple service plans.,2,1,See,2,e.g.,,2

1.The multiple service plan disclosure requirements in § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)() apply when a financial institution offers more than one service plan within a particular prepaid account program, each plan has a different fee schedule, and the financial institution opts not to disclose the default service plan pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)().Model Form A-10(e). For example, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with one service plan for which a consumer pays no periodic fee but instead pays a fee for each transaction, and another plan that includes a monthly fee but no per transaction fee may use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(). Similarly, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with preferred rates or fees for the prepaid accounts of consumers who also use another non-prepaid service (a mobile phone service), often referred to as "loyalty plans," may also use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(). Pricing variations based on whether a consumer elects to use a specific feature of a prepaid account, such as waiver of the monthly fee for consumers electing to receive direct deposit, does not constitute multiple service plans or a loyalty plan. See comment 18(b)(3)(iii)-1.ii for guidance on providing a single disclosure for like fees for multiple service plan short form disclosures.
