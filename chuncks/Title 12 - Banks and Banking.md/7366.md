###### Fees for overdrafts.

2.The financial institution may not impose fees for items it is required to honor under ยง 205.11. It may, however, impose any normal transaction or item fee that is unrelated to an overdraft resulting from the debiting. If the account is still overdrawn after five business days, the institution may impose the fees or finance charges to which it is entitled, if any, under an overdraft credit plan.
