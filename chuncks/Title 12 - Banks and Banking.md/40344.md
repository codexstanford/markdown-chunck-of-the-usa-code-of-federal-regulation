#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Repayment period.

2.If the terms of an open-end credit plan provide for a repayment period during which no further draws may be taken, the limitations in § 1026.32(d)(1)(i) apply to regular periodic payments required by the credit plan during the draw period, but do not apply to any adjustment in the regular periodic payment that results from the transition from the credit plan's draw period to its repayment period. Further, the limitation on balloon payments in § 1026.32(d)(1)(i) does not preclude increases in regular periodic payments that result solely from the initial draw or additional draws on the credit line during the draw period.
