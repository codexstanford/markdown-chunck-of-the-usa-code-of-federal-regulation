##### ยง 5.24 Conversion to become a national bank.
###### Continuation of business and corporate entity.

(i)The corporate existence of the converting institution continues in the resulting national bank. The resulting national bank is considered the same business and corporate entity as the converting institution, although as to rights, powers, and duties, the resulting national bank is a national bank. Any and all of the assets and other property (whether real, personal, mixed, tangible or intangible, including choses in action, rights, and credits) of the converting institution become assets and property of the resulting national bank when the conversion occurs. Similarly, any and all of the obligations and debts of and claims against the converting institution become obligations and debts of and claims against the national bank when the conversion occurs.
