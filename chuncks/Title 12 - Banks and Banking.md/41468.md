#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Balloon-payment mortgage with a three-year loan term; fixed interest rate.

i.A loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 6 percent, which is below the APOR-calculated threshold for a comparable transaction; thus the loan is not a higher-priced covered transaction. The loan amount is $200,000, and the loan has a three-year loan term but is amortized over 30 years. The monthly payment scheduled for the first three years following consummation is $1,199, with a balloon payment of $193,367 due at the end of the third year. For purposes of § 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must determine the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on the balloon payment of $193,367.
