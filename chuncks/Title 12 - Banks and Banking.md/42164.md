#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Replacement or substitute cards.

3.A card issuer is not required to comply with § 1026.61(c) when a hybrid prepaid-credit card is permitted to be replaced, or substituted, for another hybrid prepaid-credit card without a request or application under § 1026.12(a)(2) and related commentary. For example, § 1026.61(c) does not apply to situations where a prepaid account or credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is replaced because of security concerns and a new hybrid prepaid-credit card is issued to access the new prepaid account or covered separate credit feature without a request or application under § 1026.12(a)(2).
