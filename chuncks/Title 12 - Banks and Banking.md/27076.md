###### Aggregating requests.

(g)To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, EXIM may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. EXIM cannot aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
