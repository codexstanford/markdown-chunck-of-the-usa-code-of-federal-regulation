iii. The person offering the non-covered separate credit feature does not become a card issuer under § 1026.2(a)(7) and thus does not become a creditor under § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv) because the prepaid card can be used to access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature. The person offering the non-covered separate credit feature, however, may already have obligations under this regulation with respect to that separate credit feature. For example, if the non-covered separate credit feature is an open-end credit card account offered by an unrelated third-party creditor that is not an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer, the person already will be a card issuer under § 1026.2(a)(7) and a creditor under § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii). Nonetheless, in that case, the person does not need to comply with the provisions in the regulation applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards even though the prepaid card can access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature. The obligations under this regulation that apply to a non-covered separate credit feature are not affected by the fact that the prepaid card can access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature.§ 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and comments 4(b)(11)-1.ii, 6(b)(2)-2, 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1, 12(d)(3)-2.iii, 52(a)(2)-3, 52(b)-4, 55(a)-4, and 60(b)-4.
