#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Estimated amounts.

1.Section 1026.37(o)(2) incorporates the "estimated" designations reflected on form H-24 of appendix H to this part into the disclosure requirements of § 1026.37, even if the relevant provision of § 1026.37 does not expressly require or permit disclosure of the word "estimate." Where form H-24 uses the abbreviation "est." in place of the word "estimated," § 1026.37(o)(2) also incorporates that designation into its requirement. For example, § 1026.37(c)(2)(iv) requires disclosure of the total periodic payment labeled "Total Monthly Payment," but the label on form H-24 contains the designation "Estimated" and thus, the label required by § 1026.37(c)(2)(iv) must contain the designation "Estimated." Although many of the disclosures required by § 1026.38 cross-reference their counterparts in § 1026.37, § 1026.38(t) incorporates the "estimated" designations reflected on form H-25, not form H-24.
