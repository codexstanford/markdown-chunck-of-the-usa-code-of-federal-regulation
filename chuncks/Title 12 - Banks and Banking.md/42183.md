#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### e.g.,

B. A creditor that discloses "YES" as the answer to "Can this amount increase after closing?" pursuant to § 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) may use months or years for the § 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) disclosures, consistent with comment 37(b)(6)-1. For example, for a 10-month construction loan, the first § 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) disclosure bullet may disclose, "Adjusts every mo. starting in mo. 1" and the second § 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) disclosure bullet may disclose, "Can go as high as $[insert maximum possible periodic principal and interest payment] in year 1". The calculation of the maximum possible periodic principal and interest payment disclosed is based on the maximum principal balance that could be outstanding during the construction phase. As part of the "First Change/Amount" disclosure in the "Adjustable Payment (AP) Table" pursuant to § 1026.37(i)(5)(i), the creditor may omit and leave blank the amount or range corresponding to the first periodic principal and interest payment that may change. In such cases, the creditor must still disclose the timing of the first change, which is the number of the earliest possible payment (1st payment) that may change under the terms of the legal obligation.

C. When separate construction disclosures or the combined construction-permanent disclosures are provided for adjustable-rate construction financing, a creditor provides the § 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) disclosures reflecting changes that are due to changes in the interest rate and changes that are due to changes in the total amount advanced. Such a creditor discloses "YES" as the answer to "Can this amount increase after closing?" pursuant to § 1026.37(b)(6), because the initial periodic payment may increase based upon an increase in the interest rate in addition to a change based on the total amount advanced. Such a creditor also discloses a reference to the adjustable payment table required by § 1026.37(i), disclosed as provided in comment app. D-7.iv.B, because that disclosure reflects both a change due to a change in the total amount advanced, which is a change to the periodic principal and interest payment that is not based on an adjustment to the interest rate, as well as the fact that there are interest-only payments. Such a creditor also includes a reference to the adjustable interest rate table required by § 1026.37(j) because that disclosure reflects a change due to a change in the interest rate.
