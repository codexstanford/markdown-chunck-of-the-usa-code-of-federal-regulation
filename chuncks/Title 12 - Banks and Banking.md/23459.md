(1)(i) To determine the offset amount, the FDIC will take the sum of the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, both as reported on the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income, and multiply the sum by an institution's total base assessment rate, as calculated under ยง 327.16, including any adjustments under ยง 327.16(e).

(ii) To the extent that an institution does not report the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program, such as in an insured branch's Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, the FDIC will take the sum of either the quarterly average amount of loans pledged to the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility as reported in the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, or the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program, as such certified data is provided to the FDIC, and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, as reported in the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, and multiply the sum by an institution's total base assessment rate, as calculated under ยง 327.16.
