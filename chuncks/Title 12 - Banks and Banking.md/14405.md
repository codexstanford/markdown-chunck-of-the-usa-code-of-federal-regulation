###### General.

2.Section 226.24(e) permits creditors to put credit information together in one place in a catalog or other multiple-page advertisement or in an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site). The rule applies only if the advertisement contains one or more of the triggering terms from ยง 226.24(d)(1). A list of different annual percentage rates applicable to different balances, for example, does not trigger further disclosures under ยง 226.24(d)(2) and so is not covered by ยง 226.24(e).
