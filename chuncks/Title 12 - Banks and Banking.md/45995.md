####### Principle of conservatism.

(c)Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, an Enterprise may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:

(1) The Enterprise can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of FHFA that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;

(2) The Enterprise appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;

(3) The Enterprise notifies FHFA in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and

(4) The exposures to which the Enterprise applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the Enterprise.
