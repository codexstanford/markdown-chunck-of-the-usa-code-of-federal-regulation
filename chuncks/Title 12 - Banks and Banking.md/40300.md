##### Example.

C.Assume that a $3,000 private mortgage insurance premium charged on a closed-end mortgage loan is payable at or before closing and is required to be refunded on a pro rata basis and that the refund is automatically issued upon notification of the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan. Assume also that the maximum premium allowable under the National Housing Act is $2,000. In this case, the creditor could exclude $2,000 from points and fees but would have to include the $1,000 that exceeds the allowable premium under the National Housing Act. However, if the $3,000 private mortgage insurance premium were not required to be refunded on a pro rata basis or if the refund were not automatically issued upon notification of the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan, the entire $3,000 premium would be included in points and fees.
