#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Forward commitments.

1.A creditor may make a mortgage loan that will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the transaction is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a "forward commitment." A balloon-payment mortgage that will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment does not satisfy the requirements of § 1026.43(f)(1)(v), whether the forward commitment provides for the purchase and sale of the specific transaction or for the purchase and sale of transactions with certain prescribed criteria that the transaction meets. However, a purchase and sale of a balloon-payment qualified mortgage to another person that separately meets the requirements of § 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) is permitted. For example: Assume a creditor that meets the requirements of § 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) makes a balloon-payment mortgage that meets the requirements of § 1026.43(f)(1)(i) through (iv); if the balloon-payment mortgage meets the purchase criteria of an investor with which the creditor has an agreement to sell such loans after consummation, then the balloon-payment mortgage does not meet the definition of a qualified mortgage in accordance with § 1026.43(f)(1)(v). However, if the investor meets the requirement of § 1026.43(f)(1)(vi), the balloon-payment qualified mortgage retains its qualified mortgage status.
