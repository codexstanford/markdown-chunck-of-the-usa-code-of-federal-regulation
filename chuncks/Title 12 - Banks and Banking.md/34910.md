##### United States Federal statute or regulation.

4.An insured institution can still use § 1005.32(b)(5) to provide estimates of covered third-party fees for a remittance transfer sent to a particular designated recipient's institution even if the insured institution sent more than 500 transfers to the designated recipient's institution in the prior calendar year if a United States Federal statute or regulation prohibits the insured institution from being able to determine the exact covered third-party fees required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) for the remittance transfer and the insured institution meets the other conditions set forth in § 1005.32(b)(5). A United States Federal statute or regulation specifically prohibits the insured institution from being able to determine the exact covered third-party fees for the remittance transfer if the United States Federal statute or regulation:

i. Prohibits the insured institution from disclosing exact covered third-party fees in disclosures for transfers to a designated recipient's institution; or

ii. Makes it infeasible for the insured institution to form a relationship with the designated recipient's institution and that relationship is necessary for the insured institution to be able to determine, at the time it must provide the applicable disclosures, exact covered third-party fees.
