#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Waiting period.

2.The seven-business-day waiting period begins when the creditor delivers the disclosures or places them in the mail, not when the consumer receives or is considered to have received the disclosures. For example, if a creditor delivers the early disclosures to the consumer in person or places them in the mail on Monday, June 1, consummation may occur on or after Tuesday, June 9, the seventh business day following delivery or mailing of the early disclosures, because, for the purposes of § 1026.19(e)(1)(iii)(B), Saturday is a business day, pursuant to § 1026.2(a)(6).
