###### Relevant facts and circumstances.

ii.Listed below are facts and circumstances that are relevant to whether a substitution or replacement results in the opening of a new account or a change in the terms of an existing account for purposes of the disclosure requirements in §§ 226.6(b) and 226.9(c)(2). When most of the facts and circumstances listed below are present, the substitution or replacement likely constitutes the opening of a new account for which § 226.6(b) disclosures are appropriate. When few of the facts and circumstances listed below are present, the substitution or replacement likely constitutes a change in the terms of an existing account for which § 226.9(c)(2) disclosures are appropriate.

A. Whether the card issuer provides the consumer with a new credit card;

B. Whether the card issuer provides the consumer with a new account number;

C. Whether the account provides new features or benefits after the substitution or replacement (such as rewards on purchases);

D. Whether the account can be used to conduct transactions at a greater or lesser number of merchants after the substitution or replacement (such as when a retail card is replaced with a cobranded general purpose credit card that can be used at a wider number of merchants);

E. Whether the card issuer implemented the substitution or replacement on an individualized basis (such as in response to a consumer's request); and

F. Whether the account becomes a different type of open-end plan after the substitution or replacement (such as when a charge card is replaced by a credit card).
