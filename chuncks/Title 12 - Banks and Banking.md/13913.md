###### Transaction charges.

1.i. Section 226.14(c)(3) transaction charges include, for example:

A. A loan fee of $10 imposed on a particular advance.

B. A charge of 3 percent of the amount of each transaction.

ii. The reference to avoiding duplication in the computation requires that the amounts of transactions on which transaction charges were imposed not be included both in the amount of total balances and in the "other amounts on which a finance charge was imposed" figure. In a multifeatured plan, creditors may consider each bona fide feature separately in the calculation of the denominator. A creditor has considerable flexibility in defining features for open-end plans, as long as the creditor has a reasonable basis for the distinctions. For further explanation and examples of how to determine the components of this formula, see appendix F to part 226.
