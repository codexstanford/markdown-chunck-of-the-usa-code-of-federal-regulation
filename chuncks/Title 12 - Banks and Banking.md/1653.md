() For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3), a combination in which a national bank acquires all or substantially all of the assets, or assumes all or substantially all of the liabilities, of a Federal savings association will be treated as a consolidation for the Federal savings association.

(ii)(A) Unless the national bank has elected to follow the procedures set out in paragraph (h) of this section, national bank shareholders who dissent from a plan to consolidate may receive in cash the value of their national bank shares if they comply with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 215 as if the Federal savings association were a national bank.

(B) Unless the Federal savings association has elected to follow the procedures applicable to State savings associations pursuant to paragraph (o)(1)(i)(A) of this section, Federal savings association shareholders who dissent from a plan to consolidate or merge may receive in cash the value of their Federal savings association shares if they comply with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 215 or 215a as if the Federal savings association were a national bank.

(C) Unless the national bank or Federal savings association has elected to follow the procedures applicable to State banks or State savings associations, respectively, pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (o)(1)(i)(A) of this section, respectively, the OCC will conduct an appraisal or reappraisal of the value of a national bank or Federal savings association held by dissenting shareholders in accordance with the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 215 or 215a, as applicable, except that the costs and expenses of any appraisal or reappraisal may be apportioned and assessed by the Comptroller as he or she may deem equitable against all or some of the parties. In making this determination the Comptroller will consider whether any party has acted arbitrarily or not in good faith in respect to the rights provided by this paragraph.

(iii) The consolidation or merger agreement must address the effect upon, and the terms of the assumption of, any liquidation account of any participating institution by the resulting institution.
