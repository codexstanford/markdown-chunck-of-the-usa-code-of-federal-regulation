###### Benchmark replacement conforming changes generally.

(3) Solely with respect to any LIBOR contract that is not a consumer loan, a calculating person may make any additional technical, administrative, or operational changes, alterations, or modifications that, in that person's reasonable judgment, would be necessary or appropriate to permit the implementation, administration, and calculation of the Board-selected benchmark replacement under or with respect to a LIBOR contract after giving due consideration to any changes, alterations, or modifications otherwise required by the Board, without any requirement to obtain consent from any other person prior to the adoption of such benchmark replacement conforming changes.
