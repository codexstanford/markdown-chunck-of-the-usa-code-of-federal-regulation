1.Except as provided in ยง 226.9(g)(1), no notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is set forth initially consistent with any applicable requirements, such as rate or fee increases upon expiration of a specific period of time that were disclosed in accordance with ยง 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or rate increases under a properly disclosed variable-rate plan in accordance with ยง 226.9(c)(2)(v)(C).
