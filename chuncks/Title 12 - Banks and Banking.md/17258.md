###### § 239.66 Board review of the voluntary supervisory conversion application.
####### Board review of a voluntary supervisory conversion application.

(a)The Board will generally approve the application to engage in a voluntary supervisory conversion unless it determines:

(1) The mutual holding company does not meet the eligibility requirements for a voluntary supervisory conversion under §§ 239.65(d) or because the proceeds from the sale of the conversion stock, less the expenses of the conversion, would be insufficient to satisfy any applicable viability requirement;

(2) The transaction is detrimental to or would cause potential injury to the mutual holding company, its subsidiary savings association, or the Deposit Insurance Fund or is contrary to the public interest;

(3) The mutual holding company or the acquiror, or the controlling parties or directors and officers of the mutual holding company or the acquiror, have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in connection with the voluntary supervisory conversion; or

(4) The mutual holding company fails to justify an employment contract incidental to the conversion, or the employment contract will be an unsafe or unsound practice or represent a sale of control. In a voluntary supervisory conversion, the Board generally will not approve employment contracts of more than one year for the existing management.
