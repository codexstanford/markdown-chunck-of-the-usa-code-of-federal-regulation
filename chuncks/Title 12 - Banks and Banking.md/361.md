(ii)The temporary relief provided under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to a national bank or Federal savings association if the OCC determines that permitting the institution to determine its assets in accordance with that paragraph would not be commensurate with the risk posed by the institution. When making this determination, the OCC will consider all relevant factors, including the extent of asset growth of the national bank or Federal savings association since December 31, 2019; the causes of this growth, including whether this growth occurred as a result of a merger or acquisition; whether such growth is likely to be temporary or permanent; whether the national bank or Federal savings association has become involved in any additional activities since December 31, 2019; and the type of assets held by the national bank or Federal savings association. The OCC will notify a national bank or Federal savings association of a determination under this paragraph. A national bank or Federal savings association may, not later than 30 days after the date of a determination by the OCC, inform the OCC, in writing, of why the national bank or Federal savings association should be eligible for the temporary relief. The OCC will make a final determination after reviewing any response.
