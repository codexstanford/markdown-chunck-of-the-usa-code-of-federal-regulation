###### ยง 204.132 Treatment of loan strip participations.
####### deposit,1

(c) Because many of these transactions give rise to deposit liabilities in the form of promissory notes, acknowledgments of advance or similar obligations (written or oral) as described in ยง 204.2(a)(1)(vii) of Regulation D, the exemptions from the definition ofincorporated in that section may apply to the liability incurred by a depository institution when it offers or originates a loan strip facility. Thus, for example, loan strips sold to domestic offices of other depository institutions are exempt from Regulation D under ยง 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A)() because they are obligations issued or undertaken and held for the account of a U.S. office of another depository institution. Similarly, some of these transactions result in Eurocurrency liabilities and are reportable and reservable as such.
