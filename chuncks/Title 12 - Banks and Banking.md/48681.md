###### Periods of affordability.

(d)Housing under this section must meet the affordability requirements for not less than 10 years, beginning after Project Completion and at initial occupancy. The affordability requirements apply without regard to the term of any loan or mortgage or the transfer of ownership and must be imposed by deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other recordable mechanisms. Other recordable mechanisms must be approved in writing and in advance by the CDFI Fund. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure. However, the affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or any entity that includes the former owner or those with whom the former owner has or had family or business ties, obtains an ownership interest in the Project.
