### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Fees imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.

3.With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61, a card issuer is required to disclose under § 1026.60(b) any fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that are charges imposed as part of the plan under § 1026.6(b)(3) to the extent those fees or charges fall within the categories of fees or charges required to be disclosed under § 1026.60(b). For example, assume that a card issuer imposes a $1.25 per transaction fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card, and the card issuer charges $0.50 per transaction for purchases that access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account in the same program without such a credit feature. In this case, the $0.75 excess is a charge imposed as part of the plan under § 1026.6(b)(3) and must be disclosed under § 1026.60(b)(4).
