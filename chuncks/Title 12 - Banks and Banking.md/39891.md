## Chapter Xâ€”Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Determination of interest rate and payment.

1.This provision requires an explanation of how the creditor will determine the consumer's interest rate and payment. In cases where a creditor bases its interest rate on a specific index and adjusts the index through the addition of a margin, for example, the disclosure might read, "Your interest rate is based on the index plus a margin, and your payment will be based on the interest rate, loan balance, and remaining loan term." In transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fully amortize the outstanding balance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the creditor must disclose this fact. For example, the disclosure might read, "Your periodic payments will not fully amortize your loan and you will be required to make a single payment of the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance at the end of the loan term." The creditor, however, need not reflect any irregular final payment in the historical example or in the disclosure of the initial and maximum rates and payments. If applicable, the creditor should also disclose that the rate and payment will be rounded.
