7.Advertisements for home-equity plans must comply with all provisions in § 1026.16, not solely the rules in § 1026.16(d). If an advertisement contains information (such as the payment terms) that triggers the duty under § 1026.16(d) to state the annual percentage rate, the additional disclosures in § 1026.16(b) must be provided in the advertisement. While § 1026.16(d) does not require a statement of fees to use or maintain the plan (such as membership fees and transaction charges), such fees must be disclosed under § 1026.16(b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii).
