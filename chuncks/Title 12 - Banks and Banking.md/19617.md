###### Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date

"" means, in respect of a Fallback Index Cessation Event, the first date on which the Applicable Fallback Rate is no longer provided. If the Applicable Fallback Rate ceases to be provided on the same day that it would have been observed but it was provided at the time at which it is ordinarily observed (or, if no such time is specified, at the time at which it is ordinarily published), then the Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date will be the next day on which the rate would ordinarily have been published. If the Applicable Fallback Rate is the Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, references to the Applicable Fallback Rate in this definition of "Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date" shall be deemed to be references to the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the definition of Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, as applicable.
