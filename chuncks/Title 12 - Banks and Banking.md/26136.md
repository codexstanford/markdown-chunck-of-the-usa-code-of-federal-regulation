###### Recordkeeping requirements for official items.

(c)A covered institution must maintain in its deposit account records the information needed for its information technology system to meet the requirements set forth in ยง 370.3 with respect to accounts held in the name of the covered institution from which withdrawals are made to honor a payment instrument issued by the covered institution, such as a certified check, loan disbursement check, interest check, traveler's check, expense check, official check, cashier's check, money order, or similar payment instrument.
