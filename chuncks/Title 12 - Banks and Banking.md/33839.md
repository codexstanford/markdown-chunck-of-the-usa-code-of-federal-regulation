i. Restrictions on prepayment penalties or late charges (including an increase in an interest rate or finance charge as a result of a late payment).

ii. Restrictions on transactions in which one or more of the regular periodic payments may result in an increase in the principal balance (a negative amortization feature) or may be applied solely to accrued interest and not to loan principal (an interest-only feature).

iii. Requirements that disclosures be provided.
