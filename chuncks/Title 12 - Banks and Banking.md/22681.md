######## Internal models methodology.

(d)(1)(i) With prior written approval from the FDIC, an FDIC-supervised institution may use the internal models methodology in this paragraph (d) to determine EAD for counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts (collateralized or uncollateralized) and single-product netting sets thereof, for eligible margin loans and single-product netting sets thereof, and for repo-style transactions and single-product netting sets thereof.

(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution that uses the internal models methodology for a particular transaction type (derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, or repo-style transactions) must use the internal models methodology for all transactions of that transaction type. An FDIC-supervised institution may choose to use the internal models methodology for one or two of these three types of exposures and not the other types.

(iii) An FDIC-supervised institution may also use the internal models methodology for derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, and repo-style transactions subject to a qualifying cross-product netting agreement if:

(A) The FDIC-supervised institution effectively integrates the risk mitigating effects of cross-product netting into its risk management and other information technology systems; and

(B) The FDIC-supervised institution obtains the prior written approval of the FDIC.

(iv) An FDIC-supervised institution that uses the internal models methodology for a transaction type must receive approval from the FDIC to cease using the methodology for that transaction type or to make a material change to its internal model.
