###### Time annual percentage yield is offered.

(2)For interest-bearing accounts and dividend-bearing term share accounts, the period of time the annual percentage yield will be offered, or a statement that the annual percentage yield is accurate as of a specified date. For dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, a statement that the annual percentage yield is accurate as of the last dividend declaration date. In the event that disclosure of an annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration date might be inaccurate because of known or contemplated dividend rate changes, the credit union may disclose the prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective annual percentage yield may be disclosed either in lieu of, or in addition to, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration date.
