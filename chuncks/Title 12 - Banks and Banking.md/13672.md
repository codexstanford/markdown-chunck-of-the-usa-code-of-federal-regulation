###### Changes to home-equity plans entered into on or after November 7, 1989.

6.Section 226.9(c)(1) applies when, by written agreement under § 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a home-equity plan-entered into on or after November 7, 1989-at or before its scheduled expiration, for example, by renewing a plan on terms different from those of the original plan. In disclosing the change:

i. If the index is changed, the maximum annual percentage rate is increased (to the limited extent permitted by § 226.30), or a variable-rate feature is added to a fixed-rate plan, the creditor must include the disclosures required by § 226.5b(d)(12)(x) and (d)(12)(xi), unless these disclosures are unchanged from those given earlier.

ii. If the minimum payment requirement is changed, the creditor must include the disclosures required by § 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) (and, in variable-rate plans, the disclosures required by § 226.5b(d)(12)(x) and (d)(12)(xi)) unless the disclosures given earlier contained representative examples covering the new minimum payment requirement. (See the commentary to § 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), (d)(12)(x) and (d)(12)(xi) for a discussion of representative examples.)

iii. When the terms are changed pursuant to a written agreement as described in § 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), the advance-notice requirement does not apply.
