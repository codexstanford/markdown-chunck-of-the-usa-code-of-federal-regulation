###### Variable rate disclosures.

1.The interest rate is considered variable if the terms of the legal obligation allow the creditor to increase the interest rate originally disclosed to the consumer. The provisions do not apply to increases resulting from delinquency (including late payment), default, assumption, or acceleration. In addition to disclosing the information required under §§ 226.47(b)(ii) and (iii), the creditor must disclose the information required under §§ 226.18(f)(1)(i) and (iii)-the circumstances under which the rate may increase and the effect of an increase, respectively. The creditor is required to disclose the maximum monthly payment based on the maximum possible rate in § 226.47(b)(3)(viii), and the creditor need not disclose a separate example of the payment terms that would result from an increase under § 226.18(f)(1)(iv).
