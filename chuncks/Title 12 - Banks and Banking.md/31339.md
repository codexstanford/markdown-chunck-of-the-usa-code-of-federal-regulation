###### Application of rule.

1.Credit unions need not provide rate information orally. Disclosures need be made only as appropriate. For example, the requirement to give a telephone number for a member to call about rates for interest-bearing accounts and dividend-bearing term share accounts, would not be necessary for members calling the credit union for information. Also, the disclosure requirements are applicable only to credit union employees and volunteers acting in the ordinary course of credit union business.
