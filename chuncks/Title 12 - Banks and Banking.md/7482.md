###### Application of expiration date provisions after redemption of certificate or card.

13.The requirement that funds underlying a certificate or card must not expire for at least five years from the date of issuance or date of last load ceases to apply once the certificate or card has been fully redeemed, even if the underlying funds are not used to contemporaneously purchase a specific good or service. For example, some certificates or cards can be used to purchase music, media, or virtual goods. Once redeemed by a consumer, the entire balance on the certificate or card is debited from the certificate or card and credited or transferred to another "account" established by the merchant of such goods or services. The consumer can then make purchases of songs, media, or virtual goods from the merchant using that "account" either at the time the value is transferred from the certificate or card or at a later time. Under these circumstances, once the card has been fully redeemed and the "account" credited with the amount of the underlying funds, the five-year minimum expiration term no longer applies to the underlying funds. However, if the consumer only partially redeems the value of the certificate or card, the five-year minimum expiration term requirement continues to apply to the funds remaining on the certificate or card.
