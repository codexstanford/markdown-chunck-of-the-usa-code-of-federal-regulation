### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Substantive changes.

1.A change to an agreement is substantive, and therefore is deemed an amendment of the agreement, if it alters the rights or obligations of the parties. Section 1026.58(b)(2) provides that any change in the pricing information, as defined in § 1026.58(b)(7), is deemed to be substantive. Examples of other changes that generally would be considered substantive include:

i. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer a right under the agreement, such as a clause that allows an issuer to unilaterally change the terms of an agreement.

ii. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer an obligation under the agreement, such as a clause requiring the consumer to pay an additional fee.

iii. Changes that may affect the cost of credit to the consumer, such as changes in a provision describing how the minimum payment will be calculated.

iv. Changes that may affect how the terms of the agreement are construed or applied, such as changes in a choice-of-law provision.

v. Changes that may affect the parties to whom the agreement may apply, such as provisions regarding authorized users or assignment of the agreement.
