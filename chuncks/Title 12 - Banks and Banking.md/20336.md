(A) To determine under § 217.1(d)(2)(ii) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.1(d)(2)(ii)) whether a capital element may be included in a company's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital consistent with the loss absorption capacity of the element and in accordance with § 217.20(e) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.20(e)); and

(B) To determine under the definition of "financial institution" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) whether a company is a financial institution based on its activities.

(ii) After consultation with the General Counsel:

(A) To require under § 217.1(d)(1) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.1(d)(1)) a company to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under Regulation Q because the company's capital requirements under Regulation Q are not commensurate with the company's credit, market, operational or other risks;

(B) To determine under § 217.1(d)(2)(i) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.1(d)(2)(i)) whether an element of capital must be excluded in whole or in part from capital because the capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise presents safety and soundness concerns;

(C) To require under § 217.1(d)(3) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.1(d)(3)) that a company assign a different risk-weighted asset amount to an exposure or deduct the amount of the exposure from its regulatory capital because the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under Regulation Q for the exposure is not commensurate with the risks associated with the exposure;

(D) To determine under § 217.1(d)(4) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.1(d)(4)) whether the leverage exposure amount, or the amount reflected in a company's reported average total consolidated assets, for an on- or off-balance sheet exposure (under § 217.10 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.10)) is inappropriate for the exposure(s) or the circumstances of the company, and, based on this determination, require the company to adjust this amount in the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the company's leverage ratio calculations;

(E) To determine under § 217.1(d)(5) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.1(d)(5)) whether the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure, or the treatment provided to an entity that is not consolidated on a company's balance sheet, is commensurate with the risk of the exposure and the relationship of the company to the entity, and, based on this determination, require the company to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated on the company's balance sheet; and

(F) With respect to any deduction or limitation required under Regulation Q, to require under § 217.1(d)(6) of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.1(d)(6)) a different deduction or limitation provided that such alternative deduction or limitation is commensurate with the company's risk and consistent with safety and soundness.

(iii)(A) To determine under paragraph (5) of the definition of "distribution" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) whether a transaction is in substance a distribution of capital;

(B) To act on a request from a company under the definition of "eligible credit derivative" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) to find that a credit derivative (other than a credit default swap, nth-to-default swap, or total return swap) should be considered an eligible credit derivative;

(C) To determine under the definition of "main index" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) whether an index is a main index because the equities represented by the index have comparable liquidity, depth of market, and size of bid-ask spreads as equities in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and FTSE All-World Index;

(D) To determine under the definition of "multilateral development bank" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) whether a multilateral lending institution or regional development bank poses a comparable credit risk to other multilateral development banks;

(E) To determine under the definition of "qualifying central counterparty" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) whether a central counterparty meets the requirements for qualification as a qualifying central counterparty;

(F) To determine under paragraph (8) of the definition of "traditional securitization" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) whether a transaction is not a traditional securitization based on the transaction's leverage, risk profile, or economic substance; and

(G) To determine under paragraph (9) of the definition of "traditional securitization" in § 217.2 of Regulation Q (12 CFR 217.2) whether a transaction is a traditional securitization based on the transaction's leverage, risk profile, or economic substance.
