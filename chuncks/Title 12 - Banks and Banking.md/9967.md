####### Backtesting.

(b)A Board-regulated institution must compare each of its most recent 250 business days' trading losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures calibrated to a one-day holding period and at a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level. A Board-regulated institution must begin backtesting as required by this paragraph (b) no later than one year after the later of January 1, 2014 and the date on which the Board-regulated institution becomes subject to this subpart. In the interim, consistent with safety and soundness principles, a Board-regulated institution subject to this subpart as of January 1, 2014 should continue to follow backtesting procedures in accordance with the Board's supervisory expectations.

(1) Once each quarter, the Board-regulated institution must identify the number of exceptions (that is, the number of business days for which the actual daily net trading loss, if any, exceeds the corresponding daily VaR-based measure) that have occurred over the preceding 250 business days.

(2) A Board-regulated institution must use the multiplication factor in Table 1 to ยง 217.204 that corresponds to the number of exceptions identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine its VaR-based capital requirement for market risk under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and to determine its stressed VaR-based capital requirement for market risk under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section until it obtains the next quarter's backtesting results, unless the Board notifies the Board-regulated institution in writing that a different adjustment or other action is appropriate.
