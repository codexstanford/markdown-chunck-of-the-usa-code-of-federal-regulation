##### Relationship between "gift certificate" and "store gift card."

1.The term "store gift card" in § 1005.20(a)(2) includes "gift certificate" as defined in § 1005.20(a)(1). For example, a numeric or alphanumeric code representing a specified dollar amount or value that is electronically sent to a consumer as a gift which can be redeemed or exchanged by the recipient to obtain goods or services may be both a "gift certificate" and a "store gift card" if the specified amount or value cannot be increased.
