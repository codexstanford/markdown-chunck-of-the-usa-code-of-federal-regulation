##### Collection of fees after consumer receives disclosures.

1.A fee may be collected after the consumer receives the disclosures and brochure and before the expiration of three days, although the fee must be refunded if, within three days of receiving the required information, the consumer decides to not enter into the agreement. In such a case, the consumer must be notified that the fee is refundable for three days. The notice must be clear and conspicuous and in writing, and may be included with the disclosures required under § 1026.40(d) or as an attachment to them. If disclosures and brochure are mailed to the consumer, § 1026.40(h) provides that a nonrefundable fee may not be imposed until six business days after the mailing.
