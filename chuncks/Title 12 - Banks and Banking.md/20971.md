####### Voting securities

(i)(1)means shares of common or preferred stock, general or limited partnership shares or interests, membership interests, or similar interests if the shares or interests, by statute, charter, or in any manner, entitle the holder:

(i) To vote for, or to select, directors, trustees, managers of an LLC, partners, or other persons exercising similar functions of the issuing entity; or

(ii) To vote on, or to direct, the conduct of the operations or significant policies of the issuing entity.

(2) Nonvoting shares: Shares of common or preferred stock, limited partnership shares or interests, membership interests, or similar interests are not "voting securities" if:

(i) Any voting rights associated with the shares or interests are limited solely to the type customarily provided by State statute with regard to matters that would significantly and adversely affect the rights or preference of the security or other interest, such as the issuance of additional amounts or classes of senior securities, the modification of the terms of the security or interest, the dissolution of the issuing entity, or the payment of dividends by the issuing entity when preferred dividends are in arrears;

(ii) The shares or interests represent an essentially passive investment or financing device and do not otherwise provide the holder with control over the issuing entity; and

(iii) The shares or interests do not entitle the holder, by statute, charter, or in any manner, to select, or to vote for the selection of, directors, trustees, managers of an LLC, partners, or persons exercising similar functions of the issuing entity.

(3) Class of voting securities: Voting securities issued by a single issuer are deemed to be the same class of voting securities, regardless of differences in dividend rights or liquidation preference, if the securities are voted together as a single class on all matters for which the securities have voting rights other than matters described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section that affect solely the rights or preferences of the securities.
