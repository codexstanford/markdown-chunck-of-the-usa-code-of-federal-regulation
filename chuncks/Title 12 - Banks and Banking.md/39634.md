#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Positive periodic payment amounts.

2.Only positive periodic payment amounts trigger the additional disclosures under § 1026.16(b)(2). Therefore, if the periodic payment amount advertised is not a positive amount (e.g., "No payments"), the advertisement need not state the total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation.
