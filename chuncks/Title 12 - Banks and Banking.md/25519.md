###### Economically depressed regions.

(b)(1) For the purpose of determining "economically depressed regions", the FDIC will determine whether an institution qualifies as being located in an "economically depressed region" on a case-by-case basis. That determination will be based on four criteria:

(i) High unemployment rates;

(ii) Significant declines in non-farm employment;

(iii) High delinquency rates of real estate assets at insured depository institutions; and

(iv) Evidence indicating declining real estate values.

(2) In addition, the FDIC will also consider relevant information from institutions regarding their geographic market area, as well as information on whether that market is "economically depressed".
