# Title 12 - Banks and Banking
## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Additional prohibitions applicable under other sections.

1.Section 1026.34 sets forth certain prohibitions in connection with high-cost mortgages, in addition to the limitations in § 1026.32(d). Further, § 1026.35(b) prohibits certain practices in connection with closed-end transactions that meet the coverage test in § 1026.35(a). Because the coverage test in § 1026.35(a) is generally broader than the coverage test in § 1026.32(a), most closed-end high-cost mortgages are also subject to the prohibitions set forth in § 1026.35(b) (such as escrows), in addition to the limitations in § 1026.32(d).
