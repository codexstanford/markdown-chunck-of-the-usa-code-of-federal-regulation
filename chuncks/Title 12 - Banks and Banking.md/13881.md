###### Different billing error.

1.Examples of a different billing error include:

i. Differences in the amount of an error (for example, the customer asserts a $55.00 error but the error was only $53.00).

ii. Differences in other particulars asserted by the consumer (such as when a consumer asserts that a particular transaction never occurred, but the creditor determines that only the seller's name was disclosed incorrectly).
