## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Requirement applies to all open accounts.

1.The requirement to provide access to credit card agreements under § 1026.58(e) applies to all open credit card accounts, regardless of whether such agreements are required to be submitted to the Bureau pursuant to § 1026.58(c) (or posted on the card issuer's Web site pursuant to § 1026.58(d)). For example, a card issuer that is not required to submit agreements to the Bureau because it qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 1026.58(c)(5)) would still be required to provide cardholders with access to their specific agreements under § 1026.58(e). Similarly, an agreement that is no longer offered to the public would not be required to be submitted to the Bureau under § 1026.58(c), but would still need to be provided to the cardholder to whom it applies under § 1026.58(e).
