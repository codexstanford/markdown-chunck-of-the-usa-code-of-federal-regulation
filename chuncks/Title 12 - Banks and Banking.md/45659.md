(d)In order to recognize an agreement as a qualifying master netting agreement as defined in § 1240.2, an Enterprise must:

(i) The agreement meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of the definition of "qualifying master netting agreement" in § 1240.2; and

(ii) In the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from default or from receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the agreement to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions; and

(2) Establish and maintain written procedures to monitor possible changes in relevant law and to ensure that the agreement continues to satisfy the requirements of the definition of "qualifying master netting agreement" in § 1240.2.
