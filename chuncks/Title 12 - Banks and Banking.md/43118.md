### PART 1073-PROCEDURES FOR BUREAU DEBT COLLECTION
#### Subpart B-Administrative Offset
##### § 1073.204 Debtor's rights.
###### Opportunity for review.

(b)(1) Any request by the debtor for such review shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the Bureau within 30 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Offset. The Director may waive the time limit for requesting review for good cause shown by the debtor;

(2) Upon receipt of a request for review by the debtor, the Director shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the Director determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone (e.g., when the determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity). Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although all significant matters discussed at the hearing shall be documented.

(3) In cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Bureau shall make its determination based on a documentary hearing consisting of a review of the written record.
