##### ยง 5.24 Conversion to become a national bank.
###### Policy.

(d)Consistent with the OCC's chartering policy, it is OCC policy to allow conversion to a national bank charter by another financial institution that can operate safely and soundly as a national bank in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. A converting financial institution also must obtain all necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals. The OCC may deny an application by any State bank, stock State savings association, and any Federal stock savings association to convert to a national bank charter on the basis of the standards for denial set forth in ยง 5.13(b), or when conversion would permit the filer to escape supervisory action by its current regulators.
