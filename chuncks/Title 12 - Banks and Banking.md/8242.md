(2) Subpart B of this part, including its incorporation of Article 4A, governs a payment order even though the originator's or beneficiary's account may be a consumer account established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. That act and Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) implementing it do not apply to funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service (see 15 U.S.C. 1693a(7)(B) and 12 CFR 1005.3(c)(3)), except that section 919 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act may govern a Fedwire funds transfer that is a "remittance transfer." Such remittance transfers that are Fedwire funds transfers continue to be governed by subpart B. Thus, subpart B applies to all funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service even though some such transfers involve originators or beneficiaries who are consumers.
