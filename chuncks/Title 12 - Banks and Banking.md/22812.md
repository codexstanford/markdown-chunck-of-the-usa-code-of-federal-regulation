####### § 324.151 Introduction and exposure measurement.
######## General.

(a)(1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to investment funds, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply either the Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA) in § 324.152 or, if it qualifies to do so, the Internal Models Approach (IMA) in § 324.153. An FDIC-supervised institution must use the look-through approaches provided in § 324.154 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.

(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 324.2), as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 324.154.
