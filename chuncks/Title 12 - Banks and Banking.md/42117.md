4.i. Under § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), a separate credit feature that meets the conditions of § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) is defined as a covered separate credit feature. In this case, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account. Section 1026.61 and other provisions in the regulation and commentary related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards refer to this credit feature either as a covered separate credit feature or a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.§§ 1026.4(c)(4), 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A), 1026.12(d)(3)(ii), and 1026.60(a)(5)(iv) and (b). In addition, several provisions in the regulation and commentary also describe this arrangement as one where a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61.§§ 1026.4(b)(11), 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D), and 1026.13(i)(2).

ii. If a prepaid card is capable of drawing or transferring credit, or authorizing either, from a separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the prepaid card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct a person-to-person transfer, the credit feature is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, even with respect to credit that is drawn or transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. For example, with respect to a covered separate credit feature, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. This credit transaction is considered a credit transaction on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, even though the load or transfer of funds occurred outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers.
