###### ยง 223.21 What valuation and timing principles apply to credit transactions?
####### Example.

(iii)A member bank with capital stock and surplus of $1,000 and no outstanding covered transactions makes a $120 unsecured loan to a nonaffiliate. The member bank does not make the loan in contemplation of the nonaffiliate becoming an affiliate. Nine months later, the member bank's holding company purchases all the stock of the nonaffiliate, thereby making the nonaffiliate an affiliate of the member bank. The member bank is not in violation of the quantitative limits of ยง 223.11 or 223.12 at the time of the stock acquisition. The member bank is, however, prohibited from engaging in any additional covered transactions with the new affiliate at least until such time as the value of the loan transaction falls below 10 percent of the member bank's capital stock and surplus. In addition, the member bank must bring the loan into compliance with the collateral requirements of ยง 223.14 promptly after the stock acquisition.
