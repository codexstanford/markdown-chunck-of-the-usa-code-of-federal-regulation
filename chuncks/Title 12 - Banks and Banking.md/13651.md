###### Amount-overdraft credit plans.

2.If credit is extended under an overdraft credit plan tied to a checking account or by means of a debit card tied to an overdraft credit plan:

i. The amount to be disclosed is that of the credit extension, not the face amount of the check or the total amount of the debit/credit transaction.

ii. The creditor may disclose the amount of the credit extensions on a cumulative daily basis, rather than the amount attributable to each check or each use of the debit card that accesses the credit plan.
