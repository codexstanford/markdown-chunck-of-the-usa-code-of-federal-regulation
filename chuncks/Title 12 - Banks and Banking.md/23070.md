###### Average total consolidated assets

(a)means the average of the covered bank's total consolidated assets, as reported on the covered bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report) for the four most recent consecutive quarters. If the covered bank has not filed a Call Report for each of the four most recent consecutive quarters, the covered bank's average total consolidated assets means the average of the covered bank's total consolidated assets, as reported on the covered bank's Call Reports, for the most recent one or more consecutive quarters. The date on which the state nonmember bank or the state savings association becomes a covered bank will be the as-of date of the most recent Call Report used in the calculation of the average.
