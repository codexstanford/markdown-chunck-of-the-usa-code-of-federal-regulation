###### Itemizing fees by type.,See

2.In itemizing fees imposed more than once in the period, credit unions may group fees if they are the same type. (ยง 707.11(a)(1) of this part regarding certain fees that are required to be grouped.) When fees of the same type are grouped together, the description must make clear that the dollar figure represents more than a single fee, for example, "total fees for checks written this period." Examples of fees that may not be grouped together are-

i. Monthly maintenance and excess-activity fees.

ii. "Transfer" fees, if different dollar amounts are imposed, such as $.50 for deposits and $1.00 for withdrawals.

iii. Fees for electronic fund transfers and fees for other services, such as balance-inquiry or maintenance fees.

iv. Fees for paying overdrafts and fees for returning checks or other items unpaid.
