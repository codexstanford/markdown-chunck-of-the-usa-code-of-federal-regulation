2.The disclosures and notice required by § 1005.15(c) may be given in the same process or appointment during which the consumer receives a government benefit card. When a consumer receives benefits eligibility information and enrolls to receive benefits during the same process or appointment, a government agency that gives the disclosures and notice required by § 1005.15(c) before the consumer chooses to receive the first benefit payment on the card complies with the timing requirements of § 1005.15(c).
