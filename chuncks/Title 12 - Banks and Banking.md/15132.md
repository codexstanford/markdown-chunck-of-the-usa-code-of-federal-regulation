###### Affiliated group of merchants.

3.The term "affiliated group of merchants" means two or more affiliated merchants or other persons that are related by common ownership or common corporate control. For example, the term would include franchisees that are subject to a common set of corporate policies or practices under the terms of their franchise licenses. The term also applies to two or more merchants or other persons that agree among each other, by contract or otherwise, to accept a credit card bearing the same name, mark, or logo (other than the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network), for the purchase of goods or services solely at such merchants or persons. For example, several local clothing retailers jointly agree to issue credit cards called the "Main Street Fashion Card" that can be used to make purchases only at those retailers. For purposes of this section, these retailers would be considered an affiliated group of merchants.
