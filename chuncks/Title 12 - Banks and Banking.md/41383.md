##### Step-rate and fixed-rate mortgages.,i.e.,

5.Where the interest rate offered under the terms of the legal obligation is not based on, and does not vary with, an index or formula (there is no fully indexed rate), the creditor must use the maximum interest rate that may apply at any time during the loan term. To illustrate:

i. Assume a step-rate mortgage with an interest rate fixed at 6.5 percent for the first two years of the loan, 7 percent for the next three years, and 7.5 percent thereafter for the remainder of loan term. For purposes of this section, the creditor must use 7.5 percent, which is the maximum rate that may apply during the loan term. "Step-rate mortgage" is defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(ii).

ii. Assume a fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate at consummation of 7 percent that is fixed for the 30-year loan term. For purposes of this section, the maximum interest rate that may apply during the loan term is 7 percent, which is the interest rate that is fixed at consummation. "Fixed-rate mortgage" is defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(iii).
