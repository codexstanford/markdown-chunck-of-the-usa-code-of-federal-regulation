3.i.If a card issuer increases the credit limit during the first year after the account is opened, ยง 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees that would otherwise be prohibited (such as a fee for increasing the credit limit). For example, assume that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $400 and the consumer is required to pay $100 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. On July 1, the card issuer increases the credit limit for the account to $600. Section 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees based on the increased credit limit.
