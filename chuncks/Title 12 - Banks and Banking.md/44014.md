##### § 1202.7 How will FHFA respond to my FOIA request?
###### Extensions of time.

(h)(1) In unusual circumstances, FHFA may extend the statutory time limit in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for no more than 10 days and notify you of-

(i) The reason for the extension; and

(ii) The date on which the determination is expected.

(2) When a request requires more than 30 days to process, FHFA will make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA contact to assist you in modifying or reformulating your request. If the request cannot be modified or reformulated, FHFA will notify you regarding an alternative time period for processing the request. FHFA will also notify you of the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution service.

(3) For the purpose of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, FHFA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. FHFA will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
