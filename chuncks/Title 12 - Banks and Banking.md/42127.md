2.A prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the requirements set forth in § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) even if a negative balance results on the asset feature of the prepaid account because the prepaid account issuer debits the amount of any provisional credit that was previously granted on the prepaid account as specified in Regulation E, 12 CFR 1005.11, so long as the prepaid account issuer otherwise complies with the conditions set forth in § 1026.61(a)(4). For example, under § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid account issuer may not impose a fee or charge enumerated under § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) with respect to this negative balance.
