###### Meaning of creditor.

3.For purposes of ยง 226.36(d) and (e), a creditor means a creditor that is not deemed to be a loan originator on the transaction under this section. Thus, a person that closes a loan in its own name (but another person provides the funds for the transaction at consummation and receives an immediate assignment of the note, loan contract, or other evidence of the debt obligation) is deemed a loan originator, not a creditor, for purposes of ยง 226.36. However, that person is still a creditor for all other purposes of Regulation Z.
