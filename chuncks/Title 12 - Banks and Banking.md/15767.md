We are delaying the availability of checks deposited into your account due to repeated overdrafts of your account. For the next six months, deposits will generally be available on the () business day after the day of your deposit for checks drawn on (), the () business day after the day of your deposit for local checks, and the () business day after the day of deposit for nonlocal checks. Checks (not drawn on us) that otherwise would have received next-day availability will be treated as either local or nonlocal checks depending on the location of the paying bank.
