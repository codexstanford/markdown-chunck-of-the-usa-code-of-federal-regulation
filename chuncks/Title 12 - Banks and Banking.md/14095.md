###### Amounts appropriate to more than one category.

3.When an amount may appropriately be placed in any of several categories and the creditor does not wish to revise the categories shown in ยง 226.18(c), the creditor has considerable flexibility in determining where to show the amount. For example:

- In a credit sale, the portion of the purchase price being financed by the creditor may be viewed as either an amount paid to the consumer or an amount paid on the consumer's account.
