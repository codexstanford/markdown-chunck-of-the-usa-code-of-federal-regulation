### Subchapter A - Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
#### PART 226-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Form of disclosures-relation to other sections.

1.Creditors must make the disclosures required under this subpart in accordance with § 226.46(c). Section 226.46(c)(2) requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else. In complying with this requirement, creditors may follow the rules in § 226.17, except where specifically provided otherwise. For example, although § 226.17(b) requires creditors to provide only one set of disclosures before consummation of the transaction, §§ 226.47(b) and (c) require that the creditor provide the disclosures under § 226.18 both upon approval and after the consumer accepts the loan.
