2.When two or more consumers apply for an extension of credit as joint obligors with primary liability on an obligation, § 1026.43(c)(2)(viii) requires a creditor to consider the credit history of all such joint applicants. If a consumer is merely a surety or guarantor, § 1026.43(c)(2)(viii) does not require a creditor to consider the credit history of such surety or guarantor. The requirements of § 1026.43(c)(2)(viii) do not affect the disclosure requirements of this part, such as, for example, §§ 1026.17(d), 1026.23(b), 1026.31(e), 1026.39(b)(3), and 1026.46(f).
