###### Inclusion of pricing information.

1.For purposes of this section, a credit card agreement is deemed to include certain information, such as annual percentage rates and fees, even if the issuer does not otherwise include this information in the basic credit contract. This information is listed under the defined term "pricing information" in ยง 226.58(b)(7). For example, the basic credit contract may not specify rates, fees and other information that constitutes pricing information as defined in ยง 226.58(b)(7); instead, such information may be provided to the cardholder in a separate document sent along with the card. However, this information nevertheless constitutes part of the agreement for purposes of ยง 226.58.
