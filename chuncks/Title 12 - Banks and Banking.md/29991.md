This definition includes a credit union-owned branch, a mobile branch, an office operated on a regularly scheduled weekly basis, a credit union-owned ATM, or a credit union-owned electronic facility that meets, at a minimum, these requirements. A service facility also includes a shared branch or a shared branch network location, including a shared ATM or other electronic facility, if a credit union participates in a shared branching network. For purposes of serving an underserved area: (1) A service facility is a place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted, and loans are disbursed; and (2) a service facility does not include an ATM or shared ATM.

The credit union's internet website is not a service facility.
