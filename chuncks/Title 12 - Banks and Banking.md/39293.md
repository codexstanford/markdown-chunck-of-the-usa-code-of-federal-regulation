##### Sale credit.

1.The term "sale credit" refers to a purchase in which the consumer uses a credit card or otherwise directly accesses an open-end line of credit (see comment 8(b)-1 if access is by means of a check) to obtain goods or services from a merchant, whether or not the merchant is the card issuer or creditor. See comment 8(a)-9 for guidance on when credit accessed by a hybrid prepaid-credit card from a covered separate credit feature is "sale credit' or "nonsale credit." "Sale credit" includes:

i. The purchase of funds-transfer services (such as a wire transfer) from an intermediary.

ii. The purchase of services from the card issuer or creditor. For the purchase of services that are costs imposed as part of the plan under § 1026.6(b)(3), card issuers and creditors comply with the requirements for identifying transactions under this section by disclosing the fees in accordance with the requirements of § 1026.7(b)(6). For the purchases of services that are not costs imposed as part of the plan, card issuers and creditors may, at their option, identify transactions under this section or in accordance with the requirements of § 1026.7(b)(6).
