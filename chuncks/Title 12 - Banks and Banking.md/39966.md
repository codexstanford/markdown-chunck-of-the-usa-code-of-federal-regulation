#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Documentation requirement.

3.In order to comply with § 1026.25, creditors must retain records demonstrating compliance with the requirements of § 1026.19(e). For example, if revised disclosures are provided because of a changed circumstance under § 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) affecting settlement costs, the creditor must be able to show compliance with § 1026.19(e) by documenting the original estimate of the cost at issue, explaining the reason for revision and how it affected settlement costs, showing that the corrected disclosure increased the estimate only to the extent that the reason for revision actually increased the cost, and showing that the timing requirements of § 1026.19(e)(4) were satisfied. However, the documentation requirement does not require separate corrected disclosures for each change. A creditor may provide corrected disclosures reflecting multiple changed circumstances, provided that the creditor's documentation demonstrates that each correction complies with the requirements of § 1026.19(e).
