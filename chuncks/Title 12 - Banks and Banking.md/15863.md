###### et seq.

New Jersey does not have a law or regulation establishing the maximum time periods within which funds deposited by check or electronic payment must be made available for withdrawal. New Jersey does, however, have regulations concerning the disclosure of a banking institution's availability policy (N.J.A.C. 3:1-15.1).

New Jersey law requires every banking institution (defined as any state or federally chartered commercial bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association) to provide written disclosure to all holders of and applicants for deposit accounts which describes the institution's funds availability policy. Institutions must also disclose to their customers any significant changes to their availability policy.
