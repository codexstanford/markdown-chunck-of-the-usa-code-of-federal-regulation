###### Termination of security interest.

1.Any security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void when the consumer exercises the right of rescission. The security interest is automatically negated, regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or perfected. Under ยง 226.15(d)(2), however, the creditor must take any action necessary to reflect the fact that the security interest no longer exists.
