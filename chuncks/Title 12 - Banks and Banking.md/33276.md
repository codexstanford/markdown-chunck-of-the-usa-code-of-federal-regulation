#### Supplement I to Part 1002-Official Interpretations
##### Consideration of age in a combined system.

5.A creditor using a credit scoring system that qualifies as "empirically derived" under § 1002.2(p) may consider other factors (such as a credit report or the applicant's cash flow) on a judgmental basis. Doing so will not negate the classification of the credit scoring component of the combined system as "demonstrably and statistically sound." While age could be used in the credit scoring portion, however, in the judgmental portion age may not be considered directly. It may be used only for the purpose of determining a "pertinent element of creditworthiness." (See comment 6(b)(2)-3.)
