##### Prepaid accounts.

3.With respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in § 1026.61, a card issuer is not prohibited under § 1026.12(d) from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (including the prepaid account) held with the card issuer (subject to the limitations of § 1026.13(d)(1)) under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the creditor does not deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the deposit account more frequently than once per calendar month, pursuant to such a plan. To illustrate, with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, assume that a periodic statement is sent out each month to a cardholder on the first day of the month and the payment due date for the amount due on that statement is the 25th day of each month. In this case:

i. The card issuer is not prohibited under § 1026.12(d) from automatically deducting the amount due on the periodic statement on the 25th of each month, or on an earlier date in each calendar month, from a deposit account held by the card issuer, if the deductions are pursuant to a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder (as discussed in comment 12(d)(3)-1) and comply with the limitations in § 1026.13(d)(1).

ii. The card issuer is prohibited under § 1026.12(d) from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (including the prepaid account) held with the card issuer more frequently than once per calendar month, such as on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made or expected to be made to the deposit account.
