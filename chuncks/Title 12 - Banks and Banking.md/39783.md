##### Combined payment schedule disclosures.

2.Creditors may combine the option in § 1026.18(g)(2) with the general payment schedule requirements in transactions where only a portion of the payment schedule meets the conditions of § 1026.18(g)(2). For example, in a transaction where payments rise sharply for five years and then decline over the next 25 years, the first five years would be disclosed under the general rule in § 1026.18(g) and the next 25 years according to the abbreviated schedule in § 1026.18(g)(2).
