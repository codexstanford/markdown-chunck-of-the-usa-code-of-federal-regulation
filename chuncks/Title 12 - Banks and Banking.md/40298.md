#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Payable at or before consummation.,General.,2,i.e.,

ii.A.Under § 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(), private mortgage insurance premiums payable at or before consummation (single or up-front premiums) may be excluded from points and fees, even though they are included in the finance charge under § 1026.4(a) and (b). However, the portion of the premium that exceeds the amount payable under policies in effect at the time of origination under section 203(c)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(c)(2)(A)) is included in points and fees. To determine whether any portion of the premium exceeds the amount payable under policies in effect at the time of origination under section 203(c)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act, a creditor references the premium amount that would be payable for the transaction under that Act, as implemented by applicable regulations and other written authorities issued by the Federal Housing Administration (such as Mortgagee Letters), even if the transaction would not qualify to be insured under that Act (including, for example, because the principal amount exceeds the maximum insurable under that Act).
