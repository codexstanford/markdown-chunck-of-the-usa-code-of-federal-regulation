###### First-lien residential real estate loan

means a loan or line of credit primarily secured by a first-lien on a one-to-four family residential property where:

(2) In transactions where the credit union holds the first-lien and junior lien(s), and no other party holds an intervening lien, for purposes of this part the combined balance will be treated as a single first-lien residential real estate loan.
