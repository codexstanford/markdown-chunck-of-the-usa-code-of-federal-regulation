ii.For purposes of § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(), the payment due date for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is the date the card issuer is required to disclose on the periodic statement pursuant to § 226.7(b)(11)(i)(A). Because § 226.7(b)(11)(ii) provides that § 226.7(b)(11)(i) does not apply to periodic statements provided for charged-off accounts where full payment of the entire account balance is due immediately, § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)() also does not apply to the mailing or delivery of periodic statements provided solely for such accounts. Furthermore, although § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)() requires the card issuer to have reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a payment is not treated as late for any purpose during the 21-day period following mailing or delivery of the statement, § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)() does not prohibit a card issuer from continuing to treat prior payments as late during that period.comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-2. Similarly, although § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)() applies to open-end consumer credit accounts in these circumstances, § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)()() does not prohibit a creditor from continuing treating prior payments as late during the 14-day period following mailing or delivery of a periodic statement. Section 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)() does not apply to charged-off accounts where full payment of the entire account balance is due immediately because such accounts do not provide a grace period.
