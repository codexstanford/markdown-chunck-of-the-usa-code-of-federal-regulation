###### Security deposits.

3.A security deposit that is charged to a credit card account is a fee for purposes of ยง 226.52(a). In contrast, however, a security deposit is not subject to the 25 percent limit in ยง 226.52(a)(1) if it is not charged to the account. For example, ยง 226.52(a)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from requiring a consumer to provide funds at account opening pledged as security for the account that exceed 25 percent of the credit limit at account opening so long as those funds are not obtained from the account.
