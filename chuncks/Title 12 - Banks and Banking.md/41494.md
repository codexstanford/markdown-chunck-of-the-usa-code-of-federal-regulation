### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Late payment-12 months prior to application.,i.e.,

1.Under § 1026.43(d)(2)(iv), the exemptions in § 1026.43(d)(3) apply to a covered transaction only if, during the 12 months immediately preceding the creditor's receipt of the consumer's written application for a refinancing, the consumer has made no more than one payment on the non-standard mortgage more than 30 days late. (For an explanation of "written application," see comment 43(d)(2)-1.) For example, assume a consumer applies for a refinancing on May 1, 2014. Assume also that the consumer made a non-standard mortgage payment on August 15, 2013, that was 45 days late. The consumer made no other late payments on the non-standard mortgage between May 1, 2013, and May 1, 2014. In this example, the requirement under § 1026.43(d)(2)(iv) is met because the consumer made only one payment that was over 30 days late within the 12 months prior to applying for the refinancing (eight and one-half months prior to application).
