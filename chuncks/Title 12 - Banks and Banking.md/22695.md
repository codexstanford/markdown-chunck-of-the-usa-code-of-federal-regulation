######## Other measures of counterparty exposure.

(10)(i) With prior written approval of the FDIC, a FDIC-supervised institution may set EAD equal to a measure of counterparty credit risk exposure, such as peak EAD, that is more conservative than an alpha of 1.4 times the larger of EPEand EPEfor every counterparty whose EAD will be measured under the alternative measure of counterparty exposure. The FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate the conservatism of the measure of counterparty credit risk exposure used for EAD. With respect to paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section:

(A) For material portfolios of new OTC derivative products, the FDIC-supervised institution may assume that the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section for a period not to exceed 180 days.

(B) For immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the FDIC-supervised institution generally may assume that the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section.

(ii) To calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of the approach in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of ยง 324.131, multiply the output of the formula by the EAD for the exposure as specified above, and multiply by 12.5.
