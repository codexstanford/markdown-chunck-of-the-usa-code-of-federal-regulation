##### Consistent terminology.

1.Section 1005.18(b)(8) requires that fee names and other terms be used consistently within and across the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b). For example, a financial institution may not name the fee required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b)(2)(vii) an "inactivity fee" in the short form disclosure and a "dormancy fee" in the long form disclosure. However, a financial institution may substitute the term prepaid "account" for the term prepaid "card," as appropriate, wherever it is used in § 1005.18(b).
