##### Disclosure of balloon payment amounts.,see

3.Although the existence of a balloon payment is determined pursuant to § 1026.37(b)(5) and its commentary (comment 37(c)(1)(i)(B)-1), balloon payment amounts to be disclosed under § 1026.37(c) are calculated in the same manner as periodic principal and interest payments under § 1026.37(c)(2)(i). For example, for a balloon payment amount that can change depending on previous interest rate adjustments that are based on the value of an index at the time of the adjustment, the balloon payment amounts are calculated using the assumptions for minimum and maximum interest rates described in § 1026.37(c)(2)(i) and its commentary, and should be disclosed as a range of payments.
