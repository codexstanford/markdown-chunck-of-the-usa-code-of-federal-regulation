###### ยง 204.127 Nondepository participation in "Federal funds" market.
####### selling

(b) The Board's interpretation regarding Federal funds transactions (12 CFR 204.126) clarified that a depository institutions's liability must be issued to an exempt institution described in ยง 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D for its own account in order to come within the nondeposit exemption for interdepository liabilities. The Board regards transactions which result in third parties gaining access to the Federal funds market as contrary to the exemption contained in ยง 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D regardless of whether the nondepository institution third party is a party to the initial transaction or thereafter becomes a participant in the transaction through purchase of all or part of the obligation held by thedepository institution.
