###### Next-day availability.

Credit unions and industrial loan companies in California are required to give next-day availability to items drawn by the State of California or any of its departments, agencies, or political subdivisions. California law supersedes the fedeal law in that the state law does not condition next-day availability on receipt at a staffed teller station or use of a special deposit slip.

California credit unions and industrial loan companies must provide second business day availability to checks drawn on the depositary bank. Regulation CC requires next-day availability for checks deposited in a branch of the depositary bank and drawn on the same or another branch of the same bank if both branches are located in the same state or the same check processing region. Thus, generally, the Regulation CC rule for availability of on us checks preempts the California regulations. To the extent, however, that an on us check is (1) drawn on an out-of-state branch of the depositary bank that is not in the same check processing region as the branch in which it was deposited, or (2) deposited at an off-premises ATM or another facility of the depositary bank that is not considered a branch under federal law, the state regulation supersedes the Regulation CC availability requirements.
