##### Number of transactions.

4.Lessors have flexibility in handling lease transactions that may be viewed as multiple transactions. For example:

i. When a lessor leases two items to the same lessee on the same day, the lessor may disclose the leases as either one or two lease transactions.

ii. When a lessor sells insurance or other incidental services in connection with a lease, the lessor may disclose in one of two ways: As a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not Regulation Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a credit transaction.

iii. When a lessor includes an outstanding lease or credit balance in a lease transaction, the lessor may disclose the outstanding balance as part of a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not Regulation Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a credit transaction.
