##### Payment calculation for a non-standard mortgage.

1.In determining whether the monthly periodic payment for a standard mortgage is materially lower than the monthly periodic payment for the non-standard mortgage under § 1026.43(d)(2)(ii), the creditor must consider the monthly payment for the non-standard mortgage that will result after the loan is "recast," assuming substantially equal payments of principal and interest that amortize the remaining loan amount over the remaining term as of the date the mortgage is recast. For guidance regarding the meaning of "substantially equal," see comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. For the meaning of "recast," see § 1026.43(b)(11) and associated commentary.
