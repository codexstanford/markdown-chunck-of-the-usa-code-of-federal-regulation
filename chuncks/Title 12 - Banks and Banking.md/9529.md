##### Subpart D-Risk-Weighted Assets-Standardized Approach
###### Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures
####### § 217.43 Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) and the gross-up approach.
######## Gross-up approach,Applicability.

(e)-(1)A Board-regulated institution that is not subject to subpart F of this part may apply the gross-up approach set forth in this section instead of the SSFA to determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures, provided that it applies the gross-up approach to all of its securitization exposures, except as otherwise provided for certain securitization exposures in §§ 217.44 and 217.45.

(2) To use the gross-up approach, a Board-regulated institution must calculate the following four inputs:

(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;

(ii) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the Board-regulated institution's securitization resides;

(iii) Exposure amount of the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure calculated under § 217.42(c); and

(iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this subpart.
