#### PART 1202-FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
##### § 1202.4 What information is exempt from disclosure?
###### Redacted portion.

(b)If a requested record contains exempt information and information that can be disclosed and the portions can reasonably be segregated from each other, the disclosable portion of the record will be released to the requester after FHFA redacts the exempt portions. If it is technically feasible, FHFA will indicate the amount of the information redacted at the place in the record where the redaction is made and include a notation identifying the exemption that was applied, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption.
