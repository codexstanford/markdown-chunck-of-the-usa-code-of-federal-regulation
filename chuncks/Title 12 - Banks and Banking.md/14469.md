###### Preemption determination-Wisconsin.

15.Effective October 1, 1991, the Board has determined that the following provisions in the state law of Wisconsin are preempted by the federal law:

- Section 422.308(1)-the disclosure of the annual percentage rate in cases where the amount of the annual percentage rate disclosed to consumers under the state law differs from the amount that would be disclosed under federal law, since in those cases the state law requires the use of the same term as the federal law to represent a different amount than the federal law.

- Section 766.565(5)-the provision permitting a creditor to include in an open-end home equity agreement authorization to declare the account balance due and payable upon receiving notice of termination from a non-obligor spouse, since such provision is inconsistent with the purpose of the federal law.
