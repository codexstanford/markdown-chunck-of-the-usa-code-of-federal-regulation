###### Procedure for adding services that are not preapproved.

(b)To provide a service to its members that is not preapproved by NCUA:

(1) A federal corporate credit union must request approval from NCUA. The request must include a full explanation and complete documentation of the service and how the service relates to a corporate credit union's authority to provide services to its members. The request must be submitted jointly to the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision and the Secretary of the Board. The request will be treated as a petition to amend ยง 704.12 and NCUA will request public comment or otherwise act on the petition within a reasonable period of time. Before engaging in the formal approval process, a corporate credit union should seek an advisory opinion from NCUA's Office of General Counsel as to whether a proposed service is already covered by one of the authorized categories without filing a petition to amend the regulation; and

(2) A state-chartered corporate credit union must submit a request for a waiver that complies with ยง 704.1(b) to the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision.
