###### Prohibited provisions.

2.A creditor may not include a general provision in its agreement permitting changes to any or all of the terms of the plan. For example, creditors may not include "boilerplate" language in the agreement stating that they reserve the right to change the fees imposed under the plan. In addition, a creditor may not include any "triggering events" or responses that the regulation expressly addresses in a manner different from that provided in the regulation. For example, an agreement may not provide that the margin in a variable-rate plan will increase if there is a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances, because the regulation specifies that temporarily freezing the line or lowering the credit limit is the permissible response to a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances. Similarly a contract cannot contain a provision allowing the creditor to freeze a line due to an insignificant decline in property value since the regulation allows that response only for a significant decline.
