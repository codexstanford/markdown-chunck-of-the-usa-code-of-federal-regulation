##### Examples of reasonable basis to believe that a policy has been cancelled or not renewed.

1.The following are examples of where a servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower's hazard insurance policy has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than the nonpayment of premium charges:

i. A borrower notifies a servicer that the borrower has cancelled the hazard insurance coverage, and the servicer has not received notification of other hazard insurance coverage.

ii. A servicer receives a notification of cancellation or non-renewal from the borrower's insurance company before payment is due on the borrower's hazard insurance.

iii. A servicer does not receive a payment notice by the expiration date of the borrower's hazard insurance policy.
