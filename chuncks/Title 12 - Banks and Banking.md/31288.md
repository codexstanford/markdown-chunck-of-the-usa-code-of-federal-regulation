###### Aggregation.

5.In determining if an item valued at $10 or less is a bonus, credit unions must aggregate per account per calendar year items that may be given to members. In making this determination, credit unions aggregate per account only the market value of items that may be given for a specific promotion. To illustrate, assume a credit union offers in January to give members an item valued at $7 for each calendar quarter during the year that the average account balance in a share draft account exceeds $10,000. The bonus rules are triggered, since members are eligible under the promotion to receive up to $28 during the year. However, the bonus rules are not triggered if an item valued at $7 is offered to members opening a share draft account during the month of January, even though in November the credit union introduces a new promotion that includes, for example, an offer to existing share draft accountholders for an item valued at $8 for maintaining an average balance of $5,000 for the month.
