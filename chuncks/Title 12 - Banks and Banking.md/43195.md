##### Payments to a class of victims.

(b)Making payments to a class of victims will be deemed impracticable if:

(1) The expected aggregate actual payment to the class of victims is too small to justify the costs of locating the victims in the class and making payments to them;

(2) It would be impracticable under paragraph (a) of this section to make a payment to any victim in the class; or

(3) The Fund Administrator determines that other circumstances make it unreasonable to make payments to the class.
