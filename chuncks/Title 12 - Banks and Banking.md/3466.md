A bank which is exempt from maintaining the information required under § 27.3(a) shall notify the Comptroller of this fact in writing within 30 calendar days of its receipt of the Comptroller's request.

(c) If, upon review of the information maintained under § 27.3(a), the Comptroller determines that statistical analysis prior to examination is warranted, the bank will be notified.
