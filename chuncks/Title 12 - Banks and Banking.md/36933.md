Compensation for the sale of a mortgage loan and servicing rights constitutes a secondary market transaction, rather than a referral fee, and is beyond the scope of section 8 of RESPA. For purposes of section 8, in determining whether atransfer of the loan obligation has taken place, the Bureau examines the real source of funding, and the real interest of the named settlement lender.
