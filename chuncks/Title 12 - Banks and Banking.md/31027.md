##### Appendix C to Part 704 - Risk-Based Capital Credit Risk-Weight Categories
###### e.g.,

(ii) Forward agreements and other contingent obligations with a certain draw down,legally binding agreements to purchase assets at a specified future date. On the date a corporate credit union enters into a forward agreement or similar obligation, it should convert the principal amount of the assets to be purchased at 100 percent as of that date and then assign this amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor or guarantor of the item, or the nature of the collateral;

(iii) Indemnification of members whose securities the corporate credit union has lent as agent. If the member is not indemnified against loss by the corporate credit union, the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. When a corporate credit union lends its own securities, the transaction is treated as a loan. When a corporate credit union lends its own securities or is acting as agent, agrees to indemnify a member, the transaction is assigned to the risk-weight appropriate to the obligor or collateral that is delivered to the lending or indemnifying institution or to an independent custodian acting on their behalf; and

(2) 50 percent credit conversion factor (Group B).

(i) Transaction-related contingencies, including, among other things, performance bonds and performance-based standby letters of credit related to a particular transaction;

(ii) Unused portions of commitments (including home equity lines of credit and eligible ABCP liquidity facilities) with an original maturity exceeding one year except those listed in paragraph II (b)(5) of this Appendix. For eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, the resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the assets to be funded by the liquidity facility based on the assets of the obligor, after considering any collateral of guarantees.

(iii) Revolving underwriting facilities, note issuance facilities, and similar arrangements pursuant to which the corporate credit union's CUSO or member can issue short-term debt obligations in its own name, but for which the corporate credit union has a legally binding commitment to either:

(A) Purchase the obligations the member is unable to sell by a stated date; or

(B) Advance funds to its member, if the obligations cannot be sold.
