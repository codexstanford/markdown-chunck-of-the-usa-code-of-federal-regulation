1.Calculation methods that do not comply with the requirement to pay dividends on the full amount of principal in the account each day include:

i. The "rollback" method, also known as the "grace period" or "in by the 10th" method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for the period.

ii. The "increments of par value" method, where credit unions only pay dividends on full shares in an account, e.g., a credit union with $5 par value shares pays dividends on $20 of a $24 account balance.

iii. The "ending balance" method, where credit unions pay dividends on the balance in the account at the end of the period.

iv. The "investable balance" method, where credit unions pay dividends on a percentage of the balance, excluding an amount credit unions set aside for reserve requirements.

v. The "low balance" method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for any day in that period.
