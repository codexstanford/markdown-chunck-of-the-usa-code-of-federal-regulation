##### Permissible changes.

5.Servicers may modify the sample forms for periodic statements provided in appendix H-30 of this part to remove language that could suggest liability under the mortgage loan agreement if such language is not applicable. For example, in the case of a confirmed successor in interest who has not assumed the mortgage loan obligation under State law and is not otherwise liable on the mortgage loan obligation, a servicer may modify the forms to:

i. Use "this mortgage" or "the mortgage" instead of "your mortgage."

ii. Use "The payments on this mortgage are late" instead of "You are late on your mortgage payments."

iii. Use "This is the amount needed to bring the loan current" instead of "You must pay this amount to bring your loan current."
