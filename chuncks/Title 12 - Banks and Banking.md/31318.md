###### Verification of eligibility.

2.It is recommended that credit unions have sound written procedures in place to identify those eligible for membership. If these procedures include verification measures, such as an application process, verification telephone call or letter to an employer or association within the field of membership, witnessing by an existing member, or similar procedure, then the credit union may first verify the membership eligibility of a potential member before providing account disclosures or other information to the potential member. This process of verifying a member's eligibility status, making a recommendation for membership, and providing account disclosures should be completed within 20 calendar days. This period also applies when potential members not on credit union premises request disclosures.
