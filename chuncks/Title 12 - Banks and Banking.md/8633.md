() The total assets of the branch or agency as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter.

(B) The relief provided under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section does not apply to a branch or agency if the Board determines that permitting the branch or agency to determine its assets in accordance with that paragraph would not be commensurate with the risk profile of the branch or agency. When making this determination, the Board will consider all relevant factors, including the extent of asset growth of the branch or agency since December 31, 2019; the causes of such growth, including whether growth occurred as a result of mergers or acquisitions; whether such growth is likely to be temporary or permanent; whether the branch or agency has become involved in any additional activities since December 31, 2019; the asset size of any parent companies; and the type of assets held by the branch or agency. In making a determination pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B), the Board will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 263.202.
