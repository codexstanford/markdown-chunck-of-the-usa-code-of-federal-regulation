ii. On the other hand, a transaction will be treated as "nonsale credit" for purposes of § 1026.8(b) in cases where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant and credit is transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume the same facts as above, except that the $15 will be transferred from the credit feature to the asset feature, and a transaction of $25 is debited from the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, the $15 credit transaction is treated as "nonsale credit" under § 1026.8(b).comment 8(b)-1.vi below.

iii. If a transaction is "sale credit" as described above in comment 8(a)-9.i, the following applies:

A. If a hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is partially paid with funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account, and partially paid with credit from a covered separate credit feature, the amount to be disclosed under § 1026.8(a) is the amount of the credit extension, not the total amount of the purchase transaction.

B. For a transaction at point of sale where credit from a covered separate credit feature is accessed by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, and that transaction partially involves the purchase of goods or services and partially involves other credit such as cash back given to the cardholder, the creditor must disclose the entire amount of the credit transaction as sale credit, including the part of the transaction that does not relate to the purchase of goods or services.
