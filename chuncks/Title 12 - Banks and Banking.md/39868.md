### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Examples of waivers within the seven-business-day waiting period.

2.Assume the early disclosures are delivered to the consumer in person on Monday, June 1, and at that time the consumer executes a waiver of the seven-business-day waiting period (which would end on Tuesday, June 9) so that the loan can be consummated on Friday, June 5:

i. If the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures is inaccurate under § 1026.22, the creditor must provide a corrected disclosure to the consumer before consummation, which triggers the three-business-day waiting period in § 1026.19(a)(2)(ii). After the consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a waiver of the three-business-day waiting period in order to consummate the transaction on Friday, June 5.

ii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures inaccurate under § 1026.22, the creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent with § 1026.17(f). Disclosure of the changed terms does not trigger an additional waiting period, and the transaction may be consummated on June 5 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional modification or waiver.
