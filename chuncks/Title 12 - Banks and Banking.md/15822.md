##### Appendix E to Part 229 - Commentary
###### Model C-13 Reasonable cause hold notice.

3.This notice satisfies the written notice required under ยง 229.13(g) when a bank invokes the reasonable cause exception under ยง 229.13(e). The notice provides the bank with a list of specific reasons that may be given for invoking the exception. If a hold is being placed on more than one check in a deposit, each check must be described separately, and if different reasons apply, each reason must be indicated. A bank may disclose its reason for doubting collectibility by checking the appropriate reason on the model. If the "Other" category is checked, the reason must be given. A bank may use the actual date when funds will be available for withdrawal rather than the number of the business day following the day of deposit. A bank must incorporate in the notice the material set out in brackets if it imposes overdraft or returned check fees after invoking the reasonable cause exception under ยง 229.13(e).
