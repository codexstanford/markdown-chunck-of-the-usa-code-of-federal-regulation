(C)A financial institution that terminates federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution (including through a conversion to, or merger into, a non-federally insured credit union or an insured depository institution) shall receive a prorated NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year provided that the financial institution has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the applicable calendar year. For purposes of calculating the financial institution's average amount of insured shares, the financial institution shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods following the date of termination of federal share insurance coverage. For purposes of this subparagraph, a financial institution that terminates federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF through liquidation will be treated as terminating federal share insurance coverage during the calendar year when it enters liquidation.
