() The amount of any fee the creditor imposes on the consumer for not establishing an escrow account in connection with the transaction, labeled "Escrow Waiver Fee."

(ii) Under the reference "In the future":

(A) A statement that the consumer's property costs may change and that, as a result, the consumer's escrow payment may change;

(B) A statement that the consumer may be able to cancel any escrow account that has been established, but that the consumer is responsible for directly paying all property costs in the absence of an escrow account; and

(C) A description of the consequences if the consumer fails to pay property costs, including the actions that a State or local government may take if property taxes are not paid and the actions the creditor may take if the consumer does not pay some or all property costs, such as adding amounts to the loan balance, adding an escrow account to the loan, or purchasing a property insurance policy on the consumer's behalf that may be more expensive and provide fewer benefits than what the consumer could obtain directly.
