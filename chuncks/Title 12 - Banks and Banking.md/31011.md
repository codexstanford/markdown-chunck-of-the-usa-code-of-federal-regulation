(ii) Exposes a corporate credit union to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with the transferred asset that exceeds ashare of that corporate credit union's claim on the asset, whether through subordination provisions or other credit enhancement techniques.

(2) Residual interests generally include spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained subordinated interests (and other forms of overcollateralization), and similar assets that function as a credit enhancement. Residual interests further include those exposures that, in substance, cause the corporate credit union to retain the credit risk of an asset or exposure that had qualified as a residual interest before it was sold.

(3) Corporate credit unions will use this definition of the term "residual interests," and not the definition in ยง 704.2, for purposes of applying this Appendix.
