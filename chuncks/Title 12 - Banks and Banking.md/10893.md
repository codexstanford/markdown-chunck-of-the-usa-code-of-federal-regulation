##### Subpart C-Valuation and Timing Principles Under Section 23A
###### ยง 223.24 What valuation principles apply to extensions of credit secured by affiliate securities?
####### Example.

(3)A member bank proposes to lend $100 to a nonaffiliate secured exclusively by eligible affiliated mutual fund securities. The member bank knows that the nonaffiliate intends to use all the loan proceeds to purchase the eligible affiliated mutual fund securities that would serve as collateral for the loan. Under the attribution rule in ยง 223.16, the member bank must treat the loan to the nonaffiliate as a loan to an affiliate, and, because securities issued by an affiliate are ineligible collateral under ยง 223.14, the loan would not be in compliance with ยง 223.14.
