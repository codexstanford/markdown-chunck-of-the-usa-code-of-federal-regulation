16.These samples illustrate various mortgage transactions. They assume that the mortgages are subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). As a result, no option regarding the itemization of the amount financed has been included in the samples, because providing the good faith estimates of settlement costs required by RESPA satisfies Truth in Lending's amount financed itemization requirement. (See footnote 39 to ยง 226.18(c).)
