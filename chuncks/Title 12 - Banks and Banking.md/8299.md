#### PART 210-COLLECTION OF CHECKS AND OTHER ITEMS BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND FUNDS TRANSFERS THROUGH THE FEDWIRE FUNDS SERVICE AND THE FEDNOW SERVICE (REGULATION J)
##### Subpart C-Funds Transfers Through the FedNow Service
###### Appendix A to Subpart C of Part 210-Commentary
####### Beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank,,sender.

andThe definitions of "beneficiary," "beneficiary's bank," "receiving bank," and "sender" in subpart C of this part differ from the definitions in sections 4A-103(a)(2)-(4). The subpart C definition clarifies that, for the purposes of subpart C of this part, these terms are limited to parties in a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service. For example, the parties to a funds transfer that is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service would be governed by subpart B of this part, and would not be a "beneficiary," "beneficiary's bank," "receiving bank," or "sender" governed by subpart C. The definition of "beneficiary's bank" in subpart C further clarifies that where a Federal Reserve Bank functions as the beneficiary's bank, it need not be identified in the payment order as the beneficiary's bank and that a Federal Reserve Bank that receives a payment order as beneficiary is also the beneficiary's bank with respect to that payment order.
