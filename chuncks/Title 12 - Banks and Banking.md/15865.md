In 1983, the New York State Banking Department, pursuant to section 14-d of the New York Banking law, issued regulations requiring that funds deposited in an account be made available for withdrawal within specified time periods, and provided certain exceptions to those availability schedules. Part 34 of the New York State Banking Department's General Regulations established time frames within which commercial banks, trust companies, and branches of foreign banks (); and savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions () must make funds deposited in customer accounts available for withdrawal.

The Banking Department amended part 34, effective September 1, 1988, generally to exclude accounts covered by Regulation CC from the scope of the state regulation. Part 34.4 (a)(2) and (b)(2) of the revised New York rules, however, continue to apply to checks deposited to accounts, as defined in Regulation CC. These provisions require that the proceeds of nonlocal checks payable by a New York institution be made available for withdrawal not later than the start of the fourth business day following deposit, if deposited in a bank, or the fifth business day following deposit, if deposited in a savings institution. The revised regulation also provides that, with respect to savings accounts and time deposits, New York institutions could elect to comply with either the state or federal availability and disclosure requirements.

This preemption determination supersedes the determination issued by the Board on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 32357 (August 24, 1988)).
