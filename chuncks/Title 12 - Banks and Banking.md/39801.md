#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Rebate of finance charge.

1.i. This applies to any finance charges that do not take account of each reduction in the principal balance of an obligation. This category includes, for example:

A. Precomputed finance charges such as add-on charges. This includes computing a refund of an unearned finance charge, such as precomputed interest, by a method that is less favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method, as defined by section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 15 U.S.C. 1615(d). For purposes of computing a refund of unearned interest, if using the actuarial method defined by applicable State law results in a refund that is greater than the refund calculated by using the method described in section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, creditors should use the State law definition in determining if a refund is a prepayment penalty.

B. Charges that take account of some but not all reductions in principal, such as mortgage guarantee insurance assessed on the basis of an annual declining balance, when the principal is reduced on a monthly basis.

ii. No description of the method of computing earned or unearned finance charges is required or permitted as part of the segregated disclosures under § 1026.18(k)(2).
