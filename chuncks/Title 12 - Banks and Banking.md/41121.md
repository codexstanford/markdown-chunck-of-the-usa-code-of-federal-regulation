#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Disclosure of repayment phase-applicability of requirements.

4.Some plans provide in the initial agreement for a period during which no further draws may be taken and repayment of the amount borrowed is made. All of the applicable disclosures in this section must be given for the repayment phase. Thus, for example, a creditor must provide payment information about the repayment phase as well as about the draw period, as required by § 1026.40(d)(5). If the rate that will apply during the repayment phase is fixed at a known amount, the creditor must provide an annual percentage rate under § 1026.40(d)(6) for that phase. If, however, a creditor uses an index to determine the rate that will apply at the time of conversion to the repayment phase-even if the rate will thereafter be fixed-the creditor must provide the information in § 1026.40(d)(12), as applicable.
