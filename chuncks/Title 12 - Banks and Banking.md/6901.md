###### Bottom of the penalty-free band

(hh)means an amount equal to an institution's reserve balance requirement less an amount that is the greater of 10 percent of the institution's reserve balance requirement or $50,000. The bottom of the penalty-free band for a pass-through correspondent is an amount equal to the aggregate reserve balance requirement of the correspondent (if any) and all of its respondents less an amount that is the greater of 10 percent of that aggregate reserve balance requirement or $50,000. In no case will the penalty-free band be less than zero.
