#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Future event as maturity date.

2.An obligation whose maturity date is determined solely by a future event, as for example, a loan payable only on the sale of property, is not a demand obligation. Because no demand feature is contained in the obligation, demand disclosures under § 1026.18(i) are inapplicable and demand disclosures under § 1026.38(l)(2) are answered in the negative. The disclosures should be based on the creditor's estimate of the time at which the specified event will occur and, except as otherwise provided in § 1026.19(e) and (f), may indicate the basis for the creditor's estimate, as noted in the commentary to § 1026.17(a).
