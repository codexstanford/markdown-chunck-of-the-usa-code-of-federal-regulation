###### Preemption of state laws/Inconsistent requirements.

1.State law requirements that are inconsistent with the requirements of TISA and part 707 are preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. A state law is inconsistent if it requires a credit union to make disclosures or take actions that contradict the requirements of the federal law. A state law is also contradictory if it requires the use of the same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal law, requires the use of a term different from that required in the federal law to describe the same item, or permits a method of calculating dividends or interest on an account different from that required in the federal law.
