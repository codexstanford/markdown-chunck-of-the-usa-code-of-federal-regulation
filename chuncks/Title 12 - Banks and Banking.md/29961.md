###### Adequately capitalized

-A credit union is considered "adequately capitalized" when it meets the "adequately capitalized" definition in Part 702 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations. A multiple common bond credit union must be "adequately capitalized" in order to add new groups to its charter. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion director, with input from the appropriate regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director, may determine that a less than "adequately capitalized" credit union can qualify for an expansion if it is making reasonable progress toward becoming "adequately capitalized," and the addition of the group would not adversely affect the credit union's capitalization level.
