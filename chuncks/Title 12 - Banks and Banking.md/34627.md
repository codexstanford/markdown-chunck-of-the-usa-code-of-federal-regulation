##### Alternative for two-tier fees in the short form disclosure.

1.Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii), a financial institution may opt to disclose one fee instead of the two fees required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), (v), and (vi) and any two-tier fee required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), when the amount is the same for both fees. The following examples illustrate how to provide a single disclosure for like fees on both the short form disclosure and the multiple service plan short form disclosure:

i. A financial institution charges $1 for both in-network and out-of-network automated teller machine withdrawals in the United States. The financial institution may list the $1 fee once under the general heading "ATM withdrawal" required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii); in that case, it need not disclose the terms "in-network" or "out-of-network."
