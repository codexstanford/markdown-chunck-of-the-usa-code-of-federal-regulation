2. Consider the nature of the markets in which loans will be made;

3. Provide for consideration, prior to credit commitment, of the borrower's overall financial condition and resources, the financial responsibility of any guarantor, the nature and value of any underlying collateral, and the borrower's character and willingness to repay as agreed;

4. Establish a system of independent, ongoing credit review and appropriate communication to management and to the board of directors;

5. Take adequate account of concentration of credit risk; and

6. Are appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities.
