###### Treatment of payments.

(2)Beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any mortgage loan, with respect to payments received incorrectly by the transferor servicer (rather than the transferee servicer that should properly receive the payment on the loan), the transferor servicer shall promptly either:

(i) Transfer the payment to the transferee servicer for application to a borrower's mortgage loan account, or

(ii) Return the payment to the person that made the payment and notify such person of the proper recipient of the payment.
