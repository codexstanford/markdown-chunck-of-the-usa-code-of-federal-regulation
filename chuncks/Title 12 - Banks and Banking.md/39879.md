#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Other variable-rate regulations.

4.Transactions in which the creditor is required to comply with and has complied with the disclosure requirements of the variable-rate regulations of other Federal agencies are exempt from the requirements of § 1026.19(b), by virtue of § 1026.19(d). The exception is also available to creditors that are required by State law to comply with the Federal variable-rate regulations noted above. Creditors using this exception should comply with the timing requirements of those regulations rather than the timing requirements of Regulation Z in making the variable-rate disclosures.
