### Subchapter A—Organization and Operations
#### PART 1215 - PRODUCTION OF FHFA RECORDS, INFORMATION, AND EMPLOYEE TESTIMONY IN THIRD-PARTY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
##### § 1215.3 Definitions.
###### et seq.

(ii) Is gathered by FHFA in the course of any investigation, suspicious activity report, cease-and-desist order, civil money penalty enforcement order, suspension, removal or prohibition order, or other supervisory or enforcement orders or actions taken under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 4501

(4) The inclusion of the term "confidential" within the definition of "confidential supervisory information" is not intended to invoke the meaning of "confidential," as that term is used in Executive Order No. 13526, December 29, 2009 (75 FR 707 (Jan. 5, 2010) (President's order on the classification of National Security Information). Confidential supervisory information is used in part 1215 to refer to the distinct category of information defined in § 1215.3. FHFA used the word "confidential" within the label for this category of information simply to be consistent with the manner in which federal banking agencies refer to similar or identical types of information.
