##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Steering.

1.For purposes of ยง 226.36(e), directing or "steering" a consumer to consummate a particular credit transaction means advising, counseling, or otherwise influencing a consumer to accept that transaction. For such actions to constitute steering, the consumer must actually consummate the transaction in question. Thus, ยง 226.36(e)(1) does not address the actions of a loan originator if the consumer does not actually obtain a loan through that loan originator.
