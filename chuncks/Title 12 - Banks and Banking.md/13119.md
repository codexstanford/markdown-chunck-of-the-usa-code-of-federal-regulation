###### Subsequent changes generally.

ii.Subsequent changes to an open-end account or the threshold amount may result in the account no longer qualifying for the exemption in ยง 226.3(b). In these circumstances, the creditor must begin to comply with all of the applicable requirements of this part within a reasonable period of time after the account ceases to be exempt. Once an account ceases to be exempt, the requirements of this part apply to any balances on the account. The creditor, however, is not required to comply with the requirements of this part with respect to the period of time during which the account was exempt. For example, if an open-end credit account ceases to be exempt, the creditor must within a reasonable period of time provide the disclosures required by ยง 226.6 reflecting the current terms of the account and begin to provide periodic statements consistent with ยง 226.7. However, the creditor is not required to disclose fees or charges imposed while the account was exempt. Furthermore, if the creditor provided disclosures consistent with the requirements of this part while the account was exempt, it is not required to provide disclosures required by ยง 226.6 reflecting the current terms of the account. See also comment 3(b)-6.
