##### Interpretations
###### ยง 204.131 Participation by a depository institution in the secondary market for its own time deposits.
####### Depository institution acting as broker.

(e)The Board believes that it is permissible for a depository institution to facilitate the secondary market for its own time deposits by finding a purchaser for a time deposit that a customer is trying to sell. In such instances, the depository institution will not be paying out any of its own funds, and the depositor does not have a guarantee that the depository institution will actually be able to find a buyer.
