###### ยง 303.142 Processing.
####### Standard processing for applications and notices that have been removed from expedited processing.

(b)For an application filed by an insured state savings association seeking to commence or continue an activity under ยง 362.11(a)(2)(ii), ยง 362.11(b)(2)(i), ยง 362.12(b)(1) of this chapter or for notices which are not processed pursuant to the expedited processing procedures, the FDIC will provide the insured state savings association with written notification of the final action as soon as the decision is rendered. The FDIC will normally review and act in such cases within 60 days after receipt of a completed application or notice (subject to extension for an additional 30 days upon written notice to the bank), but failure of the FDIC to act prior to the expiration of these periods does not constitute approval.
