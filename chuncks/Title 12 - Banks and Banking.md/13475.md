###### Disclosure of payment and variable-rate examples.

3.

i. The payment-example disclosure in § 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and the variable-rate information in § 226.5b(d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi), and (d)(12)(xii) need not be provided with the disclosures under § 226.6 if the disclosures under § 226.5b(d) were provided in a form the consumer could keep; and the disclosures of the payment example under § 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), the maximum-payment example under § 226.5b(d)(12)(x) and the historical table under § 226.5b(d)(12)(xi) included a representative payment example for the category of payment options the consumer has chosen.

ii. For example, if a creditor offers three payment options (one for each of the categories described in the commentary to § 226.5b(d)(5)), describes all three options in its early disclosures, and provides all of the disclosures in a retainable form, that creditor need not provide the § 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) or (d)(12) disclosures again when the account is opened. If the creditor showed only one of the three options in the early disclosures (which would be the case with a separate disclosure form rather than a combined form, as discussed under § 226.5b(a)), the disclosures under § 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), (d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi) and (d)(12)(xii) must be given to any consumer who chooses one of the other two options. If the § 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12) disclosures are provided with the second set of disclosures, they need not be transaction-specific, but may be based on a representative example of the category of payment option chosen.
