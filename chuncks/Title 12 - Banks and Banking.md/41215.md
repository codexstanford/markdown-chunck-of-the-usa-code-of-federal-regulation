iii. The relevant factors to be considered in determining whether a replacement index has historical fluctuations substantial similar to those of a particular LIBOR index depend on the replacement index being considered and the LIBOR index being replaced. For example, these determinations may need to consider certain aspects of the historical data itself for a particular replacement index, such as whether the replacement index is a backward-looking rate (historical average of rates) such that timing aspects of the data may need to be adjusted to match up with the particular forward-looking LIBOR term-rate being replaced. The types of relevant factors to establish if a replacement index would meet the "historical fluctuations are substantially similar" standard with respect to a particular LIBOR index using historical data, include but are not limited to, whether: {1} The movements over time are substantially similar; and {2} the consumers' payments using the replacement index compared to payments using the LIBOR index are substantially similar if there is sufficient historical data for this analysis.
