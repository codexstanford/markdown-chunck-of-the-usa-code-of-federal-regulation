####### Considerations for preferential or nonroutine transfers of capital.

(b)Before authorizing a preferential or nonroutine transfer of capital, a bank board of directors must take into account and document whether:

(1) The transfer of capital is in the best interests of all of the shareholders;

(2) The bank will be able to achieve its capital adequacy and business plan goals after making the transfer of capital; and

(3) The transfer of capital is the "least cost" alternative available and will enable the association to maintain sound, adequate, and constructive service to borrowers.
