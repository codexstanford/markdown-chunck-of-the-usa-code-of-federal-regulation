###### Notice required.

(1)A Federal savings association that is well capitalized and well managed may acquire a pass-through investment, directly or through its operating subsidiary, in an enterprise that engages in the activities of holding and managing assets acquired by the parent savings association through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted, by filing a written notice in accordance with this paragraph (h)(1). The activities of the enterprise must be conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a Federal savings association. The Federal savings association must file the written notice with the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than 10 days after making the pass-through investment. This notice must include a complete description of the Federal savings association's investment in the enterprise and the activities conducted, a description of how the savings association plans to divest the pass-through investment or the underlying assets within applicable statutory time frames, and a representation and undertaking that the savings association will conduct the activities in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activities. Any Federal savings association receiving approval under this paragraph (h)(1) is deemed to have agreed that the enterprise will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
