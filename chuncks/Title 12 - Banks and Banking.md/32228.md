####### Determination of insurance coverage.

(b)The interests of each co-owner in all qualifying joint accounts shall be added together and the total shall be insured up to the SMSIA. ("A&B" have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $150,000; "A&C" have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $200,000; and "A&B&C" have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $375,000. A's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $300,000 ($75,000 plus $100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, A's interest would be insured in the amount of $250,000 and uninsured in the amount of $50,000. B's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $200,000 ($75,000 plus $125,000); therefore, B's interest would be fully insured. C's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $225,000 ($100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, C's interest would be fully insured.
