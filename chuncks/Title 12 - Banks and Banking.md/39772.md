#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Hypothetical example.

1.The example may, at the creditor's option appear apart from the other disclosures. The creditor may provide either a standard example that illustrates the terms and conditions of that type of credit offered by that creditor or an example that directly reflects the terms and conditions of the particular transaction. In transactions with more than one variable-rate feature, only one hypothetical example need be provided. (See the commentary to § 1026.17(a)(1) regarding disclosure of more than one hypothetical example as directly related information.)
