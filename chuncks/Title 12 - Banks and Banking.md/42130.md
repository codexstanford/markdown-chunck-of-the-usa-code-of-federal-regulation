#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Permitted authorization circumstances are not mutually exclusive.,1,2,1,2

4.The two circumstances set forth in § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A)() and () are not mutually exclusive. For example, assume a prepaid account issuer has adopted the $10 cushion described in § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A)(), and the delayed load cushion described in § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A)(). Also, assume the prepaid account issuer has received an instruction or confirmation for an incoming electronic fund transfer originated from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account but the prepaid account issuer has not received the funds from the separate asset account. In this case, a prepaid account issuer satisfies § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) if the amount of a transaction at authorization will not cause the prepaid account balance to become negative at the time of the authorization by more than the requested load amount plus the $10 cushion.
