###### Exceptions to the schedules.

Wisconsin law provides exceptions to the state availability schedules for new accounts (those opened less than 90 days) and reason to doubt collectibility (Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m)(b); 215.136(2); and 186.117(2)). The state availability law also permits commercial banks to vary the funds availability requirements by agreement (Wisconsin Statute section 404.103(1)). In all cases where the Federal schedule preempts the state schedule, only the Federal exceptions apply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule (e.g., in-state nonlocal checks), a state exception must apply in order to extend the state availability schedule up to the Federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held up to the Federal availability limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold only if a Federal exception can be applied to the deposit. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customer in accordance with ยง 229.13(g) of Regulation CC.
