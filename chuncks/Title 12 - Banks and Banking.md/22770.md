######## Implicit support.

(h)If an FDIC-supervised institution provides support to a securitization in excess of the FDIC-supervised institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):

(1) The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution must disclose publicly:

(i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and

(ii) The regulatory capital impact to the FDIC-supervised institution of providing such implicit support.
