#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Terms to maturity of 24 months or more.

i.Section 1026.37(a)(8) requires disclosure of the term to maturity in years, or months, or both, as applicable. Where the term exceeds 24 months and equals a whole number of years, a creditor complies with § 1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the number of years, followed by the designation "years." Where the term exceeds 24 months but does not equal a whole number of years, a creditor complies with § 1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the term to maturity as the number of years followed by the designation "yr." and the remaining number of months, followed by the designation "mo." For example, if the term to maturity of the transaction is 185 months, the correct disclosure would be "15 yr. 5 mo."
