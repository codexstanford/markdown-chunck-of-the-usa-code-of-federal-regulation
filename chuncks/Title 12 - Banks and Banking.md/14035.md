###### Growth-equity mortgages.

13.Also referred to as payment-escalated mortgages, these mortgage plans involve scheduled payment increases to prematurely amortize the loan. The initial payment amount is determined as for a long-term loan with a fixed interest rate. Payment increases are scheduled periodically, based on changes in an index. The larger payments result in accelerated amortization of the loan. In disclosing these mortgage plans, creditors may either:

- Estimate the amount of payment increases, based on the best information reasonably available; or

- Disclose by analogy to the variable-rate disclosures in 226.18(f)(1).
