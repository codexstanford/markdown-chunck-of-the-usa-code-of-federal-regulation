##### Product when interest rate at consummation not known.

C.If the interest rate for the permanent phase is not known at consummation for a construction-permanent loan using a single, combined construction-permanent disclosure or using separate disclosures for the permanent phase, the creditor shall disclose the loan product under §§ 1026.37(a)(10) and 1026.38(a)(5)(iii) as "Adjustable Rate." If the interest rate may increase under the terms of the legal obligation from the disclosures provided at consummation, the loan product description is "Adjustable Rate" in such cases, even if the interest rate will be fixed for the term of the permanent phase once it is set.
