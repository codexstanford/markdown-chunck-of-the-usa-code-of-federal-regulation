####### Failure to fill all independent directorships.

(h)If any independent directorship is not filled due to the failure of any nominee to receive at least 20 percent of the eligible vote, the Bank shall continue the election process for that directorship under the following procedures:

(1) The Bank's board of directors, after again consulting with the Bank's Advisory Council, shall nominate at least as many individuals as there are independent directorships to be filled. It may nominate individuals who failed to be elected in the initial vote. The Bank thereafter shall deliver to FHFA a copy of the independent director application form executed by each nominee.

(2) The Bank then shall follow the provisions in this section that are applicable to the election process for independent directors, except for the following:

(i) The Bank shall not place the name of any nominee on a ballot without prior approval of FHFA; and

(ii) The Bank may adopt a closing date that is earlier than 30 calendar days after delivery of the ballots to the eligible voting members, provided the Bank determines that an earlier closing date provides a reasonable amount of time to vote the ballots.
