#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Addition of credit features.

2.If the consumer has a non-credit card, including a prepaid card, the addition of a credit feature or plan to the card that would make the card into a credit card under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) constitutes issuance of a credit card. For example, the following constitute issuance of a credit card:

i. Granting overdraft privileges on a checking account when the consumer already has a check guarantee card; or

ii. Allowing a prepaid card to access a covered separate credit feature that would make the card into a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 with respect to the covered separate credit feature.
