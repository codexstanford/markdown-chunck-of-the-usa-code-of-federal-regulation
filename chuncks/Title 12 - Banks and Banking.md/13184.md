###### Required credit life insurance; debt cancellation or suspension coverage.

5.Credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance, and debt cancellation and suspension coverage described in § 226.4(b)(10), must be voluntary in order for the premium or charges to be excluded from the finance charge. Whether the insurance or coverage is in fact required or optional is a factual question. If the insurance or coverage is required, the premiums must be included in the finance charge, whether the insurance or coverage is purchased from the creditor or from a third party. If the consumer is required to elect one of several options-such as to purchase credit life insurance, or to assign an existing life insurance policy, or to pledge security such as a certificate of deposit-and the consumer purchases the credit life insurance policy, the premium must be included in the finance charge. (If the consumer assigns a preexisting policy or pledges security instead, no premium is included in the finance charge. The security interest would be disclosed under § 226.6(a)(4), § 226.6(b)(5)(ii), or § 226.18(m). See the commentary to § 226.4(b)(7) and (b)(8).)
