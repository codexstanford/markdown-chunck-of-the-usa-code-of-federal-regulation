3.i.If the term "introductory" is in the same phrase as the introductory rate, as that term is defined in ยง 226.16(g)(2)(ii), it will be deemed to be in immediate proximity of the listing. For example, an issuer that uses the phrase "introductory balance transfer APR X percent" has used the word "introductory" within the same phrase as the rate. (Sample G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the expiration date of the introductory rate and the rate that will apply after the introductory rate expires, if an introductory rate is disclosed in the table.)
