###### § 1277.4 Credit risk capital requirement.
####### Derivative contracts.

(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(4) (transactions with members) and (5) (cleared transactions and foreign exchange rate contracts) of this section, the credit risk capital charge for a derivative contract entered into by a Bank shall equal, after any adjustment allowed under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the sum of:

(i) The current credit exposure for the derivative contract, calculated in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section, multiplied by the credit risk percentage requirement assigned to that derivative contract pursuant to Table 2 to this section, provided that a Bank shall use the credit risk percentages from the column for instruments with maturities of one year or less for all such derivative contracts; plus

(ii) The potential future credit exposure for the derivative contract, calculated in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section, multiplied by the credit risk percentage requirement assigned to that derivative contract pursuant to Table 2 to this section, where a Bank uses the actual remaining maturity of the derivative contract for the purpose of applying Table 2 to this section; plus

(iii) A credit risk capital charge applicable to the undiscounted amount of collateral posted by the Bank with respect to a derivative contract that exceeds the Bank's current payment obligation under that derivative contract, where the charge equals the amount of such excess collateral multiplied by the credit risk percentage requirement assigned under Table 2 to this section for the custodian or other party that holds the collateral, and where a Bank deems the exposure to have a remaining maturity of one year or less when applying Table 2 to this section.

(2)(i) A Bank may reduce the credit risk capital charge calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section by the amount of the discounted value of any collateral that is held by or on behalf of the Bank against an exposure from the derivative contract, and that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If the total amount of the discounted value of the collateral is less than the credit risk capital charge calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section for a particular derivative contract, then the credit risk capital charge for the derivative contract shall equal the amount of the initial charge that remains after having been reduced by the collateral. A Bank that uses a counterparty's pledged collateral to reduce the capital charge against a derivative contract under this provision, shall also apply a capital charge to the amount of the pledged collateral that it has used to reduce its credit exposure on the derivative contract. The amount of that capital charge shall be equal to the capital charge that would be required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, whichever applies to the type of collateral, as if the Bank were to own the collateral directly. In reducing the capital charge on a particular derivative contract, the Bank shall apply the discounted value of the collateral for that derivative contract in the following manner:

(A) First, to reduce the current credit exposure of the derivative contract subject to the capital charge; and

(B) Second, and only if the total discounted value of the collateral held exceeds the current credit exposure of the contract, any remaining amounts may be applied to reduce the amount of the potential future credit exposure of the derivative contract subject to the capital charge.

(ii) If a counterparty's payment obligations to a Bank under a derivative contract are unconditionally guaranteed by a third-party, then the credit risk percentage requirement applicable to the derivative contract may be that associated with the guarantor, rather than the Bank's counterparty.

(3) The credit risk capital charge may be reduced as described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section for collateral held against the derivative contract exposure only if the collateral is:

(i) Held by, or has been paid to, the Bank or held by an independent, third-party custodian on behalf of the Bank pursuant to a custody agreement that meets the requirements of § 1221.7(c) and (d) of this chapter;

(ii) Legally available to absorb losses;

(iii) Of a readily determinable value at which it can be liquidated by the Bank; and

(iv) Subject to an appropriate discount to protect against price decline during the holding period and the costs likely to be incurred in the liquidation of the collateral, provided that such discount shall equal at least the minimum discount required under appendix B to part 1221 of this chapter for collateral listed in that appendix, or shall be estimated by the Bank based on appropriate assumptions about the price risks and liquidation costs for collateral not listed in appendix B to part 1221.

(4) The credit risk capital charge for any derivative contracts entered into between a Bank and its members shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, except that the Bank shall use the credit risk percentage requirements from Table 1 to this section, which sets forth the credit risk percentage requirements for advances.

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (e), the credit risk capital charge for:

(i) A foreign exchange rate contract (excluding gold contracts) with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less shall be zero; and

(ii) A derivative contract cleared by a derivatives clearing organization shall equal 0.16 percent times the sum of the following:

(A) The current credit exposure for the derivative contract, calculated in accordance with paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section;

(B) The potential future credit exposure for the derivative contract calculated in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section; and

(C) The amount of collateral posted by the Bank and held by the derivatives clearing organization, clearing member, or custodian in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote, but only to the extent the amount exceeds the Bank's current credit exposure to the derivatives clearing organization.
