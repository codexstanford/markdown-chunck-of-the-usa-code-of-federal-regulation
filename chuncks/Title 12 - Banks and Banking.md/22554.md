(ii) Justify and support any proposed temporary or permanent exclusion of business lines, portfolios, or exposures from the application of the advanced approaches in this subpart (which business lines, portfolios, and exposures must be, in the aggregate, immaterial to the FDIC-supervised institution);

(iii) Include the FDIC-supervised institution's self-assessment of:

(A) The FDIC-supervised institution's current status in meeting the qualification requirements in § 324.122; and

(B) The consistency of the FDIC-supervised institution's current practices with the FDIC's supervisory guidance on the qualification requirements;

(iv) Based on the FDIC-supervised institution's self-assessment, identify and describe the areas in which the FDIC-supervised institution proposes to undertake additional work to comply with the qualification requirements in § 324.122 or to improve the consistency of the FDIC-supervised institution's current practices with the FDIC's supervisory guidance on the qualification requirements (gap analysis);

(v) Describe what specific actions the FDIC-supervised institution will take to address the areas identified in the gap analysis required by paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section;

(vi) Identify objective, measurable milestones, including delivery dates and a date when the FDIC-supervised institution's implementation of the methodologies described in this subpart will be fully operational;

(vii) Describe resources that have been budgeted and are available to implement the plan; and

(viii) Receive approval of the FDIC-supervised institution's board of directors.

(2) The FDIC-supervised institution must submit the implementation plan, together with a copy of the minutes of the board of directors' approval, to the FDIC at least 60 days before the FDIC-supervised institution proposes to begin its parallel run, unless the FDIC waives prior notice.
