###### Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent before notice provided.

i.Assume that a credit card account is opened on January 1 of year one and that the payment due date for the account is the fifteenth day of the month. On June 20 of year two, the creditor has not received the required minimum periodic payments due on April 15, May 15, and June 15. On June 20, the creditor provides a notice pursuant to ยง 226.9(c) informing the consumer that a monthly maintenance fee of $10 will be charged beginning on August 4. However, ยง 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require the creditor to notify the consumer of the right to reject because the creditor has not received the April 15 minimum payment within 60 days after the due date. Furthermore, the exception in ยง 226.9(h)(3) applies and the consumer may not reject the fee.
