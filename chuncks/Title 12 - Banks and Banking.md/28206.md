####### Farm Credit bank obligor limit.

(g)No more than 10 percent of a Farm Credit bank's total capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) as defined by ยง 628.2 of this chapter may be invested in any one obligor. This obligor limit does not apply to investments in obligations that are fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by U.S. Government agencies or fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by GSEs. For a DIF, both the DIF itself and the entities obligated to pay the underlying debt are obligors.
