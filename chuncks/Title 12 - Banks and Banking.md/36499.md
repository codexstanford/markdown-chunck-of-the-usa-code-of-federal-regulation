###### Requirement to notify the consumer and attempt to resolve deficiencies,In general.

(2)-(i)Within five business days of receipt of the consumer's submission under paragraph (d) of this section, a consumer reporting agency must notify a consumer if additional information is necessary for the purpose of completing the submission and attempt to resolve any deficiency in the consumer's submission. A consumer reporting agency may only request additional information where the consumer reporting agency cannot reasonably confirm the appropriate proof of identity under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the consumer or, if applicable, the consumer's representative, the consumer did not provide victim determination documentation under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, or the consumer reporting agency cannot properly identify the adverse items of information under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. A consumer reporting agency may not, however, ask for information on the validity of the facts or circumstances detailed in the contents of the submitted trafficking documentation establishing the consumer is a victim of trafficking or whether the identified adverse information resulted from a severe form of trafficking in persons or sex trafficking under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
