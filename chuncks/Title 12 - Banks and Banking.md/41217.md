##### Substantially similar rates using index values on October 18, 2021.

3.Under § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(B), if the replacement index was published on October 18, 2021, the replacement index value in effect on October 18, 2021, and replacement margin must produce an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR index value in effect on October 18, 2021, and the margin that applied to the variable rate immediately prior to the replacement of the LIBOR index used under the plan. The replacement index and replacement margin are not required to produce an annual percentage rate that is substantially similar on the day that the replacement index and replacement margin become effective on the plan. For purposes of § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(B), if a creditor uses the SOFR-based spread-adjusted index recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for consumer products to replace the 1-month, 3-month, or 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR index as the replacement index and uses as the replacement margin the same margin that applied to the variable rate immediately prior to the replacement of the LIBOR index used under the plan, the creditor will be deemed to be in compliance with the condition in § 1026.40(f)(3)(ii)(B) that the replacement index and replacement margin would have resulted in an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR index. The following example illustrates this comment.

i. Assume that the 1-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR index used under the plan has a value of 2% on October 18, 2021, the margin that applied to the variable rate immediately prior to the replacement of the LIBOR index used under the plan is 10%, and the annual percentage rate based on that LIBOR index value and that margin is 12%. Also, assume that the creditor has selected the prime index published in the Wall Street Journal as the replacement index, and the value of the prime index is 5% on October 18, 2021. A creditor would satisfy the requirement to use a replacement index value in effect on October 18, 2021, and replacement margin that will produce an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR index value in effect on October 18, 2021, and the margin that applied to the variable rate immediately prior to the replacement of the LIBOR index used under the plan, by selecting a 7% replacement margin. (The prime index value of 5% and the replacement margin of 7% would produce a rate of 12%.) Thus, if the creditor provides a change-in-terms notice under § 1026.9(c)(1) on April 1, 2022, disclosing the prime index as the replacement index and a replacement margin of 7%, where these changes will become effective on April 17, 2022, the creditor satisfies the requirement to use a replacement index value in effect on October 18, 2021, and replacement margin that will produce an annual percentage rate substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR value in effect on October 18, 2021, and the margin that applied to the variable rate immediately prior to the replacement of the LIBOR index used under the plan. This is true even if the prime index value or the LIBOR index value changes after October 18, 2021, and the annual percentage rate calculated using the prime index value and 7% margin on April 17, 2022, is not substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR index value on October 18, 2021, or substantially similar to the rate calculated using the LIBOR index value on April 17, 2022.
