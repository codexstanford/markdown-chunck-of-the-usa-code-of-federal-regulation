###### Principal amount.,See

1.The principal amount must equal what the face amount of the note would be as of the time of approval, and it must be labeled "Total Loan Amount."Appendix H-18. This amount may be different from the "principal loan amount" used to calculate the amount financed under comment 18(b)(3)-1, because the creditor has the option under that comment of using a "principal loan amount" that is different from the face amount of the note. If the creditor elects to provide an itemization of the amount financed under ยง 226.18(c)(1) the creditor need not disclose the amount financed elsewhere.
