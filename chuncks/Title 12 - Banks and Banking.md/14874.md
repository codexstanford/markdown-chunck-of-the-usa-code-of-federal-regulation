###### Co-branding-definition of marketing.

1.The prohibition on co-branding in §§ 226.48(a) and (b) applies to the marketing of private education loans. The term marketing includes any advertisement under § 226.2(a)(2). In addition, the term marketing includes any document provided by the creditor to the consumer related to a specific transaction, such as an application or solicitation, a promissory note or a contract provided to the consumer. For example, prominently displaying the name of the educational institution at the top of the application form or promissory note without mentioning the name of the creditor, such as by naming the loan product the "University of ABC Loan," would be prohibited.
