###### Notice of appearance.

(3)Any individual acting as counsel on behalf of a party, including Enforcement counsel, must file a notice of appearance at or before the time that the individual submits papers or otherwise appears on behalf of a party in the adjudication proceeding. The notice of appearance must include a written declaration that the individual is currently qualified as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section and is authorized to represent the particular party, and if applicable, must include the attorney's jurisdiction of admission or qualification, attorney identification number, and a statement by the appearing attorney attesting to the attorney's good standing within the legal profession. By filing a notice of appearance on behalf of a party in an adjudication proceeding, the counsel agrees and represents that counsel is authorized to accept service on behalf of the represented party and that, in the event of withdrawal from representation, counsel will, if required by the hearing officer, continue to accept service until a new counsel has filed a notice of appearance or until the represented party indicates that the party will proceed on a pro se basis. The notice of appearance must provide the representative's email address, telephone number, and business address and, if different from the representative's addresses, electronic or other address at which the represented party may be served.
