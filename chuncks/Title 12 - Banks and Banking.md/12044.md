###### pro forma

This policy statement applies only to bank holding companies withconsolidated assets of less than $3 billion that (i) are not engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; and (iii) do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board may in its discretion exclude any bank holding company, regardless of asset size, from the policy statement if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.With the exception of section 4 (Additional Application Requirements for Expedited/Waived Processing), the policy statement applies to savings and loan holding companies as if they were bank holding companies.

While this policy statement primarily applies to the formation of small bank holding companies, it also applies to existing small bank holding companies that wish to acquire an additional bank or company and to transactions involving changes in control, stock redemptions, or other shareholder transactions.

The following guidelines must be followed on an ongoing basis for all organizations operating under this policy statement.

A. Reduction in parent company leverage: Small bank holding companies are to reduce their parent company debt consistent with the requirement that all debt be retired within 25 years of being incurred. The Board also expects that these bank holding companies reach a debt to equity ratio of .30:1 or less within 12 years of the incurrence of the debt.The bank holding company must also comply with debt servicing and other requirements imposed by its creditors.

B. Capital adequacy: Each insured depository subsidiary of a small bank holding company is expected to be well-capitalized. Any institution that is not well-capitalized is expected to become well-capitalized within a brief period of time.

C. Dividend restrictions: A small bank holding company whose debt to equity ratio is greater than 1.0:1 is not expected to pay corporate dividends until such time as it reduces its debt to equity ratio to 1.0:1 or less and otherwise meets the criteria set forth in §§ 225.14(c)(1)(ii), 225.14(c)(2), and 225.14(c)(7) of Regulation Y.

Small bank holding companies formed before the effective date of this policy statement may switch to a plan that adheres to the intent of this statement provided they comply with the requirements set forth above.

In assessing applications or notices by organizations subject to this policy statement, the Board will continue to take into account a full range of financial and other information about the applicant, and its current and proposed subsidiaries, including the recent trend and stability of earnings, past and prospective growth, asset quality, the ability to meet debt servicing requirements without placing an undue strain on the resources of the bank(s), and the record and competency of management. In addition, the Board will require applicants to meet the following requirements:

A. Minimum down payment: The amount of acquisition debt should not exceed 75 percent of the purchase price of the bank(s) or company to be acquired. When the owner(s) of the holding company incurs debt to finance the purchase of the bank(s) or company, such debt will be considered acquisition debt even though it does not represent an obligation of the bank holding company, unless the owner(s) can demonstrate that such debt can be serviced without reliance on the resources of the bank(s) or bank holding company.

B. Ability to reduce parent company leverage: The bank holding company must clearly be able to reduce its debt to equity ratio and comply with its loan agreement(s) as set forth in paragraph 2A above.

Failure to meet the criteria in this section would normally result in denial of an application.

A. Expedited notices under §§ 225.14 and 225.23 of Regulation Y: A small bank holding company proposal will be eligible for the expedited processing procedures set forth in §§ 225.14 and 225.23 of Regulation Y if the bank holding company is in compliance with the ongoing requirements of this policy statement, the bank holding company meets the core requirements for all applicants noted above, and the following requirements are met:
