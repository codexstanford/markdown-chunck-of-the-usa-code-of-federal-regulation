####### i.e.,

For C&I loans that are either originated or refinanced by a reporting bank before April 1, 2013, or purchased by a reporting bank before April 1, 2013, where the loans are owed to the reporting bank by a borrower that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk C&I borrower as that term is defined in this Appendix (which requires, among other things, that the borrower have obtained a C&I loan or refinanced an existing C&I loan on or after April 1, 2013) and securities purchased before April 1, 2013, that are issued by an entity that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk C&I borrower, as that term is defined in this Appendix, banks must continue to use the transition guidance in the September 2012 Call Report instructions to determine whether to report the loan or security as a higher-risk asset for purposes of the higher-risk assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves ratio. A bank may opt to apply the definition of higher-risk C&I loans and securities in this Appendix to all of its C&I loans and securities, but, if it does so, it must also apply the definition of a higher-risk C&I borrower in this Appendix without regard to when the loan is originally made or refinanced (whether made or refinanced before or after April 1, 2013).

For consumer loans (other than securitizations of consumer loans) originated or purchased prior to April 1, 2013, a bank must determine whether the loan met the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan no later than June 30, 2013.
