3.In order for a prepaid card to be a hybrid prepaid-credit card under § 1026.61(a), the prepaid card must be capable of being used from time to time to access credit as described in § 1026.61(a). Since this involves the possibility of repeated use of a single device, checks and similar instruments that can be used only once to obtain a single credit extension are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. With respect to a preauthorized check that is issued on a prepaid account for which credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, or credit is drawn, transferred or authorized to be drawn or transferred from a separate credit feature, the credit is obtained using the prepaid account number and not the check at the time of preauthorization using the prepaid account number. The prepaid account number is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if the account number meets the conditions set forth in § 1026.61(a).comment 61(a)(1)-2.
