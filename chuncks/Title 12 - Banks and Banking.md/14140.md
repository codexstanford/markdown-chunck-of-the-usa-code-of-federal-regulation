1.This applies only to those transactions in which the interest calculation takes account of all scheduled reductions in principal, as well as transactions in which interest calculations are made daily. The term penalty as used here encompasses only those charges that are assessed strictly because of the prepayment in full of a simple-interest obligation, as an addition to all other amounts. Items which are penalties include, for example:

- Interest charges for any period after prepayment in full is made. (See the commentary to ยง 226.17(a)(1) regarding disclosure of interest charges assessed for periods after prepayment in full as directly related information.)

- A minimum finance charge in a simple-interest transaction. (See the commentary to ยง 226.17(a)(1) regarding the disclosure of a minimum finance charge as directly related information.) Items which are not penalties include, for example, loan guarantee fees.
