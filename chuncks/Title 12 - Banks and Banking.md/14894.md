###### Household income and assets.

iii.Consideration of information regarding a consumer's household income does not by itself satisfy the requirement in ยง 226.51(a) to consider the consumer's independent ability to pay. For example, if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their "household income," the card issuer may not rely solely on the information provided by applicants to satisfy the requirements of ยง 226.51(a). Instead, the card issuer would need to obtain additional information about an applicant's independent income (such as by contacting the applicant). However, if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their income without reference to household income (such as by requesting "income" or "salary"), the card issuer may rely on the information provided by applicants to satisfy the requirements of ยง 226.51(a).
