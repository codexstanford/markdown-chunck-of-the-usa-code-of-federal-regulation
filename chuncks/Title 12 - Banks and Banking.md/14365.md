###### Converting open-end to closed-end credit.

8.Under certain state laws, consummation of a closed-end credit transaction may occur at the time a consumer enters into the intitial open-end credit agreement. As provided in the commentary to ยง 226.17(b), closed-end credit disclosures may be delayed under these circumstances until the conversion of the open-end account to a closed-end transaction. In accounts secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, no new right of rescission arises at the time of conversion. Rescission rights under ยง 226.15 are unaffected.
