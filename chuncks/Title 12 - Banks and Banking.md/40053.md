##### First new payment due within 210 days after consummation.

2.Section 1026.20(c) disclosures are not required if the first payment at the adjusted level is due within 210 days after consummation, when the new interest rate disclosed at consummation pursuant to § 1026.20(d) is not an estimate. For example, the creditor, assignee, or servicer would not be required to provide the disclosures required by § 1026.20(c) for the first time an ARM interest rate adjusts if the first payment at the adjusted level was due 120 days after consummation and the adjusted interest rate disclosed at consummation pursuant to § 1026.20(d) was not an estimate.
