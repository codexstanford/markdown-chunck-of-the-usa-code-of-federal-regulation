##### Prepaid finance charge.

3.The existence of a prepaid finance charge in a transaction does not, by itself, require a disclosure under § 1026.18(k). A prepaid finance charge is not considered a prepayment penalty under § 1026.18(k)(1), nor does it require a disclosure under § 1026.18(k)(2). At its option, however, a creditor may consider a prepaid finance charge to be under § 1026.18(k)(2). If a disclosure is made under § 1026.18(k)(2) with respect to a prepaid finance charge or other finance charge, the creditor may further identify that finance charge. For example, the disclosure may state that the borrower "will not be entitled to a refund of the prepaid finance charge" or some other term that describes the finance charge.
