###### Untimely notice of error.

3.An institution that provides a transaction history under § 205.18(b)(1) is not required to comply with the requirements of § 205.11 for any notice of error from the consumer pertaining to a transfer that occurred more than 60 days prior to the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accesses the account or the date the financial institution sends a written history upon the consumer's request. (Alternatively, as provided in § 205.18(c)(4)(ii), an institution need not comply with the requirements of § 205.11 with respect to any notice of error received from the consumer more than 120 days after the date of posting of the transfer allegedly in error.) Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with § 205.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer.
