###### Inquiries versus requests.

1.A response to an oral inquiry (by telephone or in person) about rates and yields or fees does not trigger the duty to provide account disclosures. But, when a member asks for written information about an account (whether by telephone, in person, or by other means), the credit union must provide disclosures unless the account is no longer offered to the public.
