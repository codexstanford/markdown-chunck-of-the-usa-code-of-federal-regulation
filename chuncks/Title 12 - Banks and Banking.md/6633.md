###### Consideration of age in a credit scoring system.

2.Age may be taken directly into account in a credit scoring system that is "demonstrably and statistically sound," as defined in ยง 202.2(p), with one limitation: applicants age 62 years or older must be treated at least as favorably as applicants who are under age 62. If age is scored by assigning points to an applicant's age category, elderly applicants must receive the same or a greater number of points as the most favored class of nonelderly applicants.
