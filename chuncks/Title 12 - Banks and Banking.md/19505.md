###### Clients Removed from an Agent's List of Excluded Clients after the date of Acceptance by ISDA of the Agent's Adherence Letter.

(j)If an Agent adheres to this Protocol using the approach described in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above and therefore specifically names or identifies one or more Clients as excluded from adherence, then for the purposes of subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(A) or 3(g)(ii)(B)(I) above, as applicable, the Agent may, after the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of its Adherence Letter, remove one or more of those Clients from its list of excluded Clients through a Platform and, as between any other Adhering Party and that Client, the Implementation Date shall be the date shown on the Platform as the date on which the Agent communicates to the other Adhering Party that the Client is removed from the list of excluded Clients (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from that other Adhering Party), unless otherwise agreed between such Agent and such Adhering Party.
