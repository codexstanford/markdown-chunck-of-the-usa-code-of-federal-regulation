###### Amount of fees.

3.Credit unions are cautioned that merely providing fee information in an account disclosure may not be sufficient to gain the legal right to impose the fee involved under applicable law. Credit unions must state the amount and conditions under which a fee may be imposed. Naming and describing the fee typically satisfies this requirement. Some examples are:

i. "$4.00 monthly service fee".

ii. $7.00 and up" or "fee depends on style of checks ordered" for check printing fees.
