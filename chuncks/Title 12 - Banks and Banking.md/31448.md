###### Indoor signs.

2.An indoor sign advertising an annual percentage yield is not misleading or inaccurate if:

i. For a tiered-rate account, it also provides the upper and lower dollar amounts of the tier corresponding to the advertised annual percentage yield.

ii. For a term share account, it also provides the term required to obtain the advertised annual percentage yield.
