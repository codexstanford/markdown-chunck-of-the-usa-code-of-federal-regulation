####### Adverse comment

(c)means any objection, protest, or other adverse written statement submitted by an interested party relative to a filing. The term adverse comment shall not include any comment concerning the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), fair lending, consumer protection, or civil rights that the appropriate regional director or designee determines to be frivolous (for example, raising issues between the commenter and the applicant that have been resolved). The term adverse comment also shall not include any other comment that the appropriate regional director or designee determines to be frivolous (for example, a non-substantive comment submitted primarily as a means of delaying action on the filing).
