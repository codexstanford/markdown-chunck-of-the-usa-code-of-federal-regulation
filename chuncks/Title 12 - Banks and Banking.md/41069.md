##### Line numbers; closing cost details.

1.Section 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A) permits the deletion of unused lines from the disclosures required by § 1026.38(f)(1) through (3) and (g)(1) through (4), if necessary to allow the addition of lines to other sections that require them for the required disclosures. This provision permits creditors and settlement agents to use the space gained from deleting unused lines for additional lines to accommodate all of the costs that are required to be itemized. For example, if the only origination charge required by § 1026.38(f)(1) is points, the remaining seven lines illustrated on form H-25 of appendix H to this part may be deleted and added to the disclosure required by § 1026.38(g)(4), if seven lines in addition to those provided on form H-25 are necessary to accommodate such disclosure.
