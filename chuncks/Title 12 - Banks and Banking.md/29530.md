(1) The stress test requires loan-level data for all Farmer Mac I program assets to determine lifetime age-adjusted loss rates. The specific loan data fields required for running the credit risk component are:

(2) From the loan-level data, you must identify the geographic distribution by state of Farmer Mac's loan portfolio and enter the current loan balance for each state in the "Data Inputs" worksheet. The lifetime age-adjustment of origination year loss rates was discussed in section 2.0, "Credit Risk." The lifetime age-adjusted loss rates are entered in the "Risk Measures" worksheet of the stress test. The stress test application of the loss rates is discussed in section 4.3, "Risk Measures."

(3) Under certain circumstances, described below, you must substitute the following data proxies for the variables LTV, DSCR, and D/A: LTV = 0.70, DSCR = 1.25, and D/A = 0.50. The substitution must be done whenever any of these data are missing, i.e., cells are blank, or one or more of the conditions in the following table is true.

In addition, the following loan data adjustments must be made in response to the situations listed below:

Further, because it would not be possible to compile an exhaustive list of loan data anomalies, FCA reserves the authority to require an explanation on other data anomalies it identifies and to apply the loan data proxies on such cases until the anomaly is adequately addressed by the Corporation.
