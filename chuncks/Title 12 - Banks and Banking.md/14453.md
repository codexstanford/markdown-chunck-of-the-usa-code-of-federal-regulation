#### PART 226-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
##### Supplement I to Part 226-Official Staff Interpretations
###### Laws not contradictory to chapters 1, 2, and 3.

3.Generally, State law requirements that call for the disclosure of items of information not covered by the Federal law, or that require more detailed disclosures, do not contradict the Federal requirements. Examples of laws that are not preempted include:

- A State law that requires disclosure of the minimum periodic payment for open-end credit, even though not required by ยง 226.7.

- A State law that requires contracts to contain warnings such as: "Read this contract before you sign. Do not sign if any spaces are left blank. You are entitled to a copy of this contract."

Similarly, a State law that requires itemization of the amount financed does not automatically contradict the permissive itemization under ยง 226.18(c). However, a State law requirement that the itemization appear with the disclosure of the amount financed in the segregated closed-end credit disclosures is inconsistent, and this location requirement would be preempted.
