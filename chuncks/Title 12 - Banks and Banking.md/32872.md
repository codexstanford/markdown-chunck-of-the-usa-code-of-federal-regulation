### Subchapter B—Regulations Affecting the Operations of the National Credit Union Administration
#### PART 792-REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AND PRIVACY ACT, AND BY SUBPOENA; SECURITY PROCEDURES FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
##### Subpart C-Production of Nonpublic Records and Testimony of NCUA Employees in Legal Proceedings
###### § 792.40 What does this subpart prohibit?
####### Duty of NCUA employees.

(a)(1) If an NCUA employee is served with a subpoena requiring him or her to appear as a witness or produce records, the employee must promptly notify the Office of General Counsel. The General Counsel has the authority to instruct NCUA employees to refuse appearing as a witness or to withhold nonpublic records. The General Counsel may let an NCUA employee provide testimony, including expert or opinion testimony, if the General Counsel determines that the need for the testimony clearly outweighs contrary considerations.

(2) If a court or other appropriate authority orders or demands expert or opinion testimony or testimony beyond authorized subjects contrary to the General Counsel's instructions, an NCUA employee must immediately notify the General Counsel of the order and respectfully decline to comply. An NCUA employee must decline to answer questions on the grounds that this subpart forbids such disclosure and should produce a copy of this subpart, request an opportunity to consult with the Office of General Counsel, and explain that providing such testimony without approval may expose him or her to disciplinary or other adverse action.
