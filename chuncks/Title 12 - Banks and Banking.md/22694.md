###### Risk-Weighted Assets for General Credit Risk
####### ยง 324.132 Counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts.
######## Risk-weighted assets for IMM exposures.

(9)(i) The FDIC-supervised institution must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of ยง 324.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EADof the netting set to obtain the unstressed capital requirement for each netting set. An FDIC-supervised institution that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(3) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the unstressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K.

(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution must insert the assigned risk parameters for each wholesale obligor and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of ยง 324.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EADof the netting set to obtain the stressed capital requirement for each netting set. An FDIC-supervised institution that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(6) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the stressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K.

(iii) The FDIC-supervised institution's dollar risk-based capital requirement under the internal models methodology equals the larger of Kand K. An FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted assets amount for IMM exposures is equal to the capital requirement multiplied by 12.5, plus risk-weighted assets for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk in paragraph (d)(8) of this section and those in paragraph (d)(10) of this section.
