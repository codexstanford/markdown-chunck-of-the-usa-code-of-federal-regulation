###### Pricing agreement variations do not constitute separate agreements.

3.Pricing information that may vary from one cardholder to another depending on the cardholder's creditworthiness or state of residence or other factors must be disclosed by setting forth all the possible variations or by providing a range of possible variations. Two agreements that differ only with respect to variations in the pricing information do not constitute separate agreements for purposes of this section. For example, a card issuer offers two types of credit card accounts that differ only with respect to the purchase APR. The purchase APR for one type of account is 15 percent, while the purchase APR for the other type of account is 18 percent. The provisions of the agreement and pricing information for the two types of accounts are otherwise identical. The card issuer should not submit to the Board one agreement with a pricing information addendum listing a 15 percent purchase APR and another agreement with a pricing information addendum listing an 18 percent purchase APR. Instead, the card issuer should submit to the Board one agreement with a pricing information addendum listing possible purchase APRs of 15 or 18 percent.
