##### Subpart C-Funds Transfers Through the FedNow Service
###### Appendix A to Subpart C of Part 210-Commentary
####### Authority and purpose.

(a)Section 210.40(a) states that the purpose of subpart C of this part is to provide rules to govern funds transfers through the FedNow Service and recites the Board's rulemaking authority for this subpart. Subpart C of this part is Federal law and is not a "funds-transfer system rule," as defined in section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A, Funds Transfers, of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as set forth in appendix A of this part. Certain provisions of Article 4A may not be varied by a funds-transfer system rule, but under section 4A-107, regulations of the Board and Operating Circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede inconsistent provisions of Article 4A to the extent of the inconsistency. In addition, regulations of the Board may preempt inconsistent provisions of state law. Accordingly, subpart C of this part supersedes or preempts inconsistent provisions of state law. It does not affect state law governing funds transfers that does not conflict with the provisions of subpart C of this part, such as Article 4A, as enacted in any state, as such state law may apply to parties to funds transfers through the FedNow Service whose rights and obligations are not governed by subpart C of this part.
