3.Creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X (including any interpretations issued by the Bureau) in deciding whether a "written application" has been received. In general, Regulation X defines "application" to mean the submission of a borrower's financial information in anticipation of a credit decision relating to a federally related mortgage loan.12 CFR 1024.2(b). An application is received when it reaches the creditor in any of the ways applications are normally transmitted-by mail, hand delivery, or through an intermediary agent or broker. (comment 19(b)-3 for guidance in determining whether or not the transaction involves an intermediary agent or broker.) If an application reaches the creditor through an intermediary agent or broker, the application is received when it reaches the creditor, rather than when it reaches the agent or broker.
