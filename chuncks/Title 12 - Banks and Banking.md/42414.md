## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1030-TRUTH IN SAVINGS (REGULATION DD)
#### Supplement I to Part 1030-Official Interpretations
##### Fees for overdrawing an account.

5.Under § 1030.4(b)(4) of this part, institutions must disclose the conditions under which a fee may be imposed. In satisfying this requirement institutions must specify the categories of transactions for which an overdraft fee may be imposed. An exhaustive list of transactions is not required. It is sufficient for an institution to state that the fee applies to overdrafts "created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or other electronic means," as applicable. Disclosing a fee "for overdraft items" would not be sufficient.
