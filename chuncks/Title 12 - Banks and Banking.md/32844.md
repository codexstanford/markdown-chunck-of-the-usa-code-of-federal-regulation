####### § 792.12 How will I know what records NCUA has determined to be exempt?

As long as it is technically feasible and does not threaten an interest protected by the FOIA, we will:

(a) Mark the place where we redacted information from documents released to you and note the exemption that protects the information from public disclosure; or

(b) Make reasonable efforts to include with our response to you an estimate of the volume of information withheld.
