###### ยง 238.5 Audit of savings association holding companies.
####### Audits required for safety and soundness purposes.

(b)(1) The Board requires an independent audit for safety and soundness purposes if, as of the beginning of its fiscal year, a savings and loan holding company controls savings association subsidiary(ies) with aggregate consolidated assets of $500 million or more.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, with regard to a savings and loan holding company's fiscal year beginning in the calendar years 2020 or 2021, the applicability of the requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be determined based on the lesser of:

(i) The aggregate consolidated assets of the savings and loan holding company as of December 31, 2019; and

(ii) The aggregate consolidated assets of the savings and loan holding company as of the end of its fiscal year ending in calendar year 2020.

(3) The relief provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply to a savings and loan holding company if the Board determines that permitting the savings and loan holding company to determine its assets in accordance with that paragraph would not be commensurate with the risk profile of the savings and loan holding company. When making this determination, the Board will consider all relevant factors, including the extent of asset growth of the savings and loan holding company since December 31, 2019; the causes of such growth, including whether growth occurred as a result of mergers or acquisitions; whether such growth is likely to be temporary or permanent; whether the savings and loan holding company has become involved in any additional activities since December 31, 2019; the asset size of any parent companies; and the type of assets held by the savings and loan holding company. In making a determination pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3), the Board will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 263.202.
