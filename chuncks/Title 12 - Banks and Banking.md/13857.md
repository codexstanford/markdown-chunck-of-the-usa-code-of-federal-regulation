###### Documentation requests.

1.A request for documentation such as receipts or sales slips, unaccompanied by an allegation of an error under ยง 226.13(a) or a request for additional clarification under ยง 226.13(a)(6), does not trigger the error resolution procedures. For example, a request for documentation merely for purposes such as tax preparation or recordkeeping does not trigger the error resolution procedures.
