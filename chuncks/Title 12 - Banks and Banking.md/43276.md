### PART 1081-RULES OF PRACTICE FOR ADJUDICATION PROCEEDINGS

##### § 1081.107 Appearance and practice in adjudication proceedings.
###### Standards of conduct; disbarment.

(c)(1) All attorneys practicing before the Bureau must conform to the standards of ethical conduct required by the bars of which the attorneys are members.

(2) If for good cause shown, the Director believes that any attorney is not conforming to such standards, or that an attorney or counsel to a party has otherwise engaged in conduct warranting disciplinary action, the Director may issue an order requiring such person to show cause why the attorney should not be suspended or disbarred from practice before the Bureau. The alleged offender will be granted due opportunity to be heard in the alleged offender's own defense and may be represented by counsel. Thereafter, if warranted by the facts, the Director may issue against the attorney or counsel an order of reprimand, suspension, or disbarment.
