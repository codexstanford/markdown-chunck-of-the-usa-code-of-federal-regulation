#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### More than one introductory rate.

iii.If more than one introductory rate may apply to a particular balance in succeeding periods, the term "introductory" need only be used to describe the first introductory rate. For example, if an issuer offers a rate of 8.99% on purchases for six months, 10.99% on purchases for the following six months, and 14.99% on purchases after the first year, the term "introductory" need only be used to describe the 8.99% rate.
