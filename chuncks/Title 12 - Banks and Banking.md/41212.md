##### Replacing LIBOR.

1.For purposes of replacing a LIBOR index used under a plan, a replacement index that is not newly established must have historical fluctuations that are substantially similar to those of the LIBOR index used under the plan, considering the historical fluctuations up through the relevant date. If the Bureau has made a determination that the replacement index and the LIBOR index have historical fluctuations that are substantially similar, the relevant date is the date indicated in that determination. If the Bureau has not made a determination that the replacement index and the LIBOR index have historical fluctuations that are substantially similar, the relevant date is the later of April 1, 2022, or the date no more than 30 days before the creditor makes a determination that the replacement index and the LIBOR index have historical fluctuations that are substantially similar.
