(a)(1) If the FDIC determines that a NGEP has willfully failed to comply in a material way with §§ 346.6 or 346.7, the FDIC will notify the NGEP in writing of that determination and provide the NGEP a period of 90 days (or such longer period as the FDIC finds to be reasonable under the circumstances) to comply.

(3) The FDIC may assist any insured depository institution or affiliate that is a party to a covered agreement that is unenforceable by a NGEP by operation of section 48 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831y) in identifying a successor to assume the NGEP's responsibilities under the agreement.
