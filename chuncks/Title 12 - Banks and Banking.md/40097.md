4.When a transaction involves "step rates" or "split rates"-that is, different rates applied at different times or to different portions of the principal balance-a single composite annual percentage rate must be calculated and disclosed for the entire transaction. Assume, for example, a step-rate transaction in which a $10,000 loan is repayable in 5 years at 10 percent interest for the first 2 years, 12 percent for years 3 and 4, and 14 percent for year 5. The monthly payments are $210.71 during the first 2 years of the term, $220.25 for years 3 and 4, and $222.59 for year 5. The composite annual percentage rate, using a calculator with a "discounted cash flow analysis" or "internal rate of return" function, is 10.75 percent.
