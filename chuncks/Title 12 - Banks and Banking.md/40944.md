##### Owner's title insurance premium.

2.In a jurisdiction where simultaneous issuance title insurance rates are permitted, any owner's title insurance premium disclosed under § 1026.38(g)(4) is calculated by using the full owner's title insurance premium, adding any simultaneous issuance premium for issuance of lender's coverage, and then deducting the full premium for lender's coverage disclosed under § 1026.38(f)(2) or (f)(3). Section 1026.38(g)(4)(i) requires that the disclosure of the cost of the premium for an owner's title insurance policy include "Title-" at the beginning of the label. In addition, § 1026.38(g)(4)(ii) requires that the disclosure of the cost of the premium for an owner's title insurance policy include the parenthetical "(optional)" at the end of the label when designated borrower-paid at or before closing.
