### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Home equity lines of credit.

1.For purposes of § 1026.43(c)(2)(iv), a simultaneous loan includes any covered transaction or home equity line of credit (HELOC) subject to § 1026.40 that will be made to the same consumer at or before consummation of the covered transaction and secured by the same dwelling that secures the covered transaction. A HELOC that is a simultaneous loan that the creditor knows or has reason to know about must be considered as a mortgage obligation in determining a consumer's ability to repay the covered transaction even though the HELOC is not a covered transaction subject to § 1026.43. See § 1026.43(a) discussing the scope of this section. "Simultaneous loan" is defined in § 1026.43(b)(12). For further explanation of "same consumer," see comment 43(b)(12)-2.
