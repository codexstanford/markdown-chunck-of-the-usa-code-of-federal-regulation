##### § 1081.201 Answer and disclosure statement and notification of financial interest.
###### If the allegations of the notice of charges are admitted.

(c)If the respondent elects not to contest the allegations of fact set forth in the notice of charges, the answer will consist of a statement that the respondent admits all the material allegations to be true. Such an answer constitutes a waiver of hearings as to the facts alleged in the notice of charges, and together with the notice of charges will provide a record basis on which the hearing officer will issue preliminary findings and conclusions, containing appropriate findings and conclusions and a proposed order disposing of the proceeding. In such an answer, the respondent may, however, reserve the right to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law under § 1081.305.
