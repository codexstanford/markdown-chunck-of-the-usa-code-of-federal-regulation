c.-i.With respect to a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest (other than a credit-enhancing I/Ostrip) or asset- and mortgage-backed security (including asset-backed commercial paper) that is a traded position and that has received an external rating on a long-term position that is one grade below investment grade or better or a short-term rating that is investment grade, the bank holding company may multiply the face amount of the position by the appropriate risk weight, determined in accordance with the tables below. Stripped mortgage-backed securities and other similar instruments, such as interest-only or principal-only strips that are not credit enhancements, must be assigned to the 100 percent risk category. If a traded position has received more than one external rating, the lowest single rating will apply.
