####### Stable retail deposit

means a retail deposit that is entirely covered by deposit insurance and:

(1) Is held by the depositor in a transactional account; or

(2) The depositor that holds the account has another established relationship with the FDIC-supervised institution such as another deposit account, a loan, bill payment services, or any similar service or product provided to the depositor that the FDIC-supervised institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the FDIC would make deposit withdrawal highly unlikely during a liquidity stress event.
