###### Notice of shareholder meetings.

(2)Written notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called must be delivered not fewer than 20 nor more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the chair of the board, the president, the secretary, or the directors, or other persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice will be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address appearing on the stock transfer books or records of the association as of the record date prescribed in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, with postage thereon prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given as in the case of an original meeting. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned is not subject to the shareholder notice requirement.
