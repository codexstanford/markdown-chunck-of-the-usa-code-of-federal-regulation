######## Exposures to foreign PSEs.

(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(3) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution must assign a risk weight to a general obligation exposure to a PSE, in accordance with Table 3 to § 324.32, based on the CRC that corresponds to the PSE's home country or the OECD membership status of the PSE's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the PSE's home country.

(ii) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(3) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution must assign a risk weight to a revenue obligation exposure to a PSE, in accordance with Table 4 to § 324.32, based on the CRC that corresponds to the PSE's home country; or the OECD membership status of the PSE's home country if there is no CRC applicable to the PSE's home country.

(3) An FDIC-supervised institution may assign a lower risk weight than would otherwise apply under Tables 3 or 4 to § 324.32 to an exposure to a foreign PSE if:

(i) The PSE's home country supervisor allows banks under its jurisdiction to assign a lower risk weight to such exposures; and

(ii) The risk weight is not lower than the risk weight that corresponds to the PSE's home country in accordance with Table 1 to § 324.32.
