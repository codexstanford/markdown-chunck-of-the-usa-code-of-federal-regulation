#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Seasonal payments.

iv.For a seasonal payment product with a unit-period of a month that does not require periodic payments for the months of June, July, and August each year during the loan term, because such feature depends on calendar months and not on when regular periodic payments begin, the period is disclosed as "from June to August." For a transaction with a quarterly unit-period that does not require a periodic payment every third quarter during the loan term and does not depend on calendar months, the period is disclosed as "every third payment." In the same transaction, if the seasonal payment feature ends after the 20th quarter, the period is disclosed as "every quarter until the 20th quarter." As described above in this comment 37(i)-2, the creditor may abbreviate "quarter" to "quart." or "Q."
