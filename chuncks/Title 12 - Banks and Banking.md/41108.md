2.The disclosures required by § 1026.39(d)(5) must identify whether the covered person accepts periodic payments from the consumer that are less than the full amount due and whether the covered person applies the payments to a consumer's loan or holds the payments in a separate account until the consumer pays the remainder of the full amount due. The disclosures required by § 1026.39(d)(5) apply only to a mortgage loan that is a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling or real property and that is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to § 1026.33. In an open-end consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, § 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide the disclosures required by § 1026.39(d)(1) through (4), but not the partial payment policy disclosure required by § 1026.39(d)(5). If, however, the dwelling in the open-end consumer credit transaction is not the consumer's principal dwelling (it is used solely for vacation purposes), none of the disclosures required by § 1026.39(d) is required because the transaction is not a mortgage loan for purposes of § 1026.39.§ 1026.39(a)(2). In contrast, a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's dwelling that is not the consumer's principal dwelling is considered a mortgage loan for purposes of § 1026.39. Assuming that the transaction is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to § 1026.33, § 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide the disclosures under § 1026.39(d)(1) through (5). But if the transaction is a reverse mortgage transaction subject to § 1026.33, § 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide only the disclosures under § 1026.39(d)(1) through (4).
