###### Payday loans; deferred presentment.

2.Credit includes a transaction in which a cash advance is made to a consumer in exchange for the consumer's personal check, or in exchange for the consumer's authorization to debit the consumer's deposit account, and where the parties agree either that the check will not be cashed or deposited, or that the consumer's deposit account will not be debited, until a designated future date. This type of transaction is often referred to as a "payday loan" or "payday advance" or "deferred-presentment loan." A fee charged in connection with such a transaction may be a finance charge for purposes of ยง 226.4, regardless of how the fee is characterized under state law. Where the fee charged constitutes a finance charge under ยง 226.4 and the person advancing funds regularly extends consumer credit, that person is a creditor and is required to provide disclosures consistent with the requirements of Regulation Z. (See ยง 226.2(a)(17).)
