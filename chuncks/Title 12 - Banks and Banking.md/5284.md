###### Operational requirements for eligible HQLA.

(a)With respect to each asset that is eligible for inclusion in a national bank's or Federal savings association's HQLA amount, a national bank or Federal savings association must meet all of the following operational requirements:

(1) The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate the operational capability to monetize the HQLA by:

(i) Implementing and maintaining appropriate procedures and systems to monetize any HQLA at any time in accordance with relevant standard settlement periods and procedures; and

(ii) Periodically monetizing a sample of HQLA that reasonably reflects the composition of the national bank's or Federal savings association's eligible HQLA, including with respect to asset type, maturity, and counterparty characteristics;

(2) The national bank or Federal savings association must implement policies that require eligible HQLA to be under the control of the management function in the national bank or Federal savings association that is charged with managing liquidity risk, and this management function must evidence its control over the HQLA by either:

(i) Segregating the HQLA from other assets, with the sole intent to use the HQLA as a source of liquidity; or

(ii) Demonstrating the ability to monetize the assets and making the proceeds available to the liquidity management function without conflicting with a business or risk management strategy of the national bank or Federal savings association;

(3) The fair value of the eligible HQLA must be reduced by the outflow amount that would result from the termination of any specific transaction hedging eligible HQLA;

(4) The national bank or Federal savings association must implement and maintain policies and procedures that determine the composition of its eligible HQLA on each calculation date, by:

(i) Identifying its eligible HQLA by legal entity, geographical location, currency, account, or other relevant identifying factors as of the calculation date;

(ii) Determining that eligible HQLA meet the criteria set forth in this section; and

(iii) Ensuring the appropriate diversification of the eligible HQLA by asset type, counterparty, issuer, currency, borrowing capacity, or other factors associated with the liquidity risk of the assets; and

(5) The national bank or Federal savings association must have a documented methodology that results in a consistent treatment for determining that the national bank's or Federal savings association's eligible HQLA meet the requirements set forth in this section.
