####### § 324.143 Supervisory formula approach (SFA).
######## Simplified method for computing N and EWALGD.

(f)(1) If all underlying exposures of a securitization are retail exposures, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply the SFA using the following simplifications:

(i) h = 0; and

(ii) v = 0.

(2) Under the conditions in §§ 324.143(f)(3) and (f)(4), an FDIC-supervised institution may employ a simplified method for calculating N and EWALGD.

(3) If Cis no more than 0.03, an FDIC-supervised institution may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = 1 if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, and may set N equal to the following amount:

(4) Alternatively, if only Cis available and Cis no more than 0.03, the FDIC-supervised institution may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = 1 if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure and may set N = 1/C.
