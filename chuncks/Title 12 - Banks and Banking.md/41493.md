#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Materially lower.

1.The exemptions afforded under § 1026.43(d)(3) apply to a refinancing only if the monthly payment for the new loan is "materially lower" than the monthly payment for an existing non-standard mortgage. The payments to be compared must be calculated based on the requirements under § 1026.43(d)(5). Whether the new loan payment is "materially lower" than the non-standard mortgage payment depends on the facts and circumstances. In all cases, a payment reduction of 10 percent or more meets the "materially lower" standard.
