#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Demand disclosures.

1.Disclosures for demand obligations are based on an assumed 1-year term, unless an alternate maturity date is stated in the legal obligation. Whether an alternate maturity date is stated in the legal obligation is determined by applicable law. An alternate maturity date is not inferred from an informal principal reduction agreement or a similar understanding between the parties. However, when the note itself specifies a principal reduction schedule (for example, "payable on demand or $2,000 plus interest quarterly"), an alternate maturity is stated and the disclosures must reflect that date.
