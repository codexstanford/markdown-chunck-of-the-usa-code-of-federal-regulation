####### General rule.

(a)All hearings shall be open to the public, unless the NCUA Board, in its discretion, determines that holding an open hearing would be contrary to the public interest. Within 20 days of service of the notice, any respondent may file with the NCUA Board a request for a private hearing, and any party may file a reply to such a request. A party must serve on the administrative law judge a copy of any request or reply the party files with the NCUA Board. The form of, and procedure for, these requests and replies are governed by ยง 747.23. A party's failure to file a request or a reply constitutes a waiver of any objections regarding whether the hearing will be public or private.
