(c)(1) Preliminary findings and conclusions must be based on a consideration of the whole record relevant to the issues decided, and be supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Preliminary findings and conclusions must include a statement of findings of fact (with specific page references to principal supporting items of evidence in the record) and conclusions of law, as well as the reasons or basis therefore, as to all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record and the appropriate order, sanction, relief or denial thereof. Preliminary findings and conclusions must also state that a notice of appeal may be filed within 14 days after service of the preliminary findings and conclusions and include a statement that, unless a party timely files and perfects a notice of appeal of the preliminary findings and conclusions, the Director may adopt the preliminary findings and conclusions as the final decision and order of the Bureau without further opportunity for briefing or argument.

(2) Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, when more than one claim for relief is presented in an adjudication proceeding, or when multiple parties are involved, the hearing officer may direct the entry of preliminary findings and conclusions as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of preliminary findings and conclusions.
