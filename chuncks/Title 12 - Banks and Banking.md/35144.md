#### Supplement I to Part 1006-Official Interpretations
##### In general.

1.Section 1006.2(j)(2)(iv) provides that a limited-content message may include a statement that, if the consumer replies, the consumer may speak to any of the company's representatives or associates. A message that includes a more detailed description of the representative or associate group is not a limited-content message. For example, a reference to an agent with the "credit card receivables group" is not a limited-content message because it includes more than a statement that the consumer's reply may be answered by a representative or associate.
