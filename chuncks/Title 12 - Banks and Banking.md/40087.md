##### Timing of receipt.

1.Section 1026.20(e)(5)(iii) provides that if the disclosures required under § 1026.20(e)(2) are not provided to the consumer in person, the consumer is considered to have received the disclosures three business days after they are delivered or placed in the mail. If the creditor or servicer provides the disclosures required by § 1026.20(e)(2) by mail, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are placed in the mail for purposes of determining when the waiting periods required by § 1026.20(e)(5)(i) and (ii) begins. Creditors and servicers that use electronic mail or a courier to provide disclosures may also follow this approach. If, however, the creditor or servicer delivers the disclosures required by § 1026.20(e)(2) to the consumer in person, the escrow account may be closed any time on the third or 30th business day following the date of delivery, as applicable. Whatever method is used to provide disclosures, creditors and servicers may rely on documentation of receipt in determining when the waiting periods required by § 1026.20(e)(5)(i) and (ii) begin.
