(2) If the mutual holding company sets a limit of five percent under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, it may modify that limit with Board approval to provide that any person, group of associated persons, or persons otherwise acting in concert subscribing for five percent, may purchase between five and ten percent as long as the aggregate amount that the subscribers purchase does not exceed 10 percent of the total stock offering.
