### PART 403 - CLASSIFICATION, DECLASSIFICATION, AND SAFEGUARDING OF NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION
#### ยง 403.7 Mandatory review for declassification.
##### See,

(h) The bank shall process requests for declassification that are submitted under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, or the Privacy Act of 1974, in accordance with the provisions of those acts. (12 CFR part 404 and 12 CFR part 405, respectively.)
