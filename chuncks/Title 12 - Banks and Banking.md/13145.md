###### Annuities associated with reverse mortgages.

2.Some creditors offer annuities in connection with a reverse-mortgage transaction. The amount of the premium is a finance charge if the creditor requires the purchase of the annuity incident to the credit. Examples include the following:

i. The credit documents reflect the purchase of an annuity from a specific provider or providers.

ii. The creditor assesses an additional charge on consumers who do not purchase an annuity from a specific provider.

iii. The annuity is intended to replace in whole or in part the creditor's payments to the consumer either immediately or at some future date.
