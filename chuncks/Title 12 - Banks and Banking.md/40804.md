2.Section 1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(A)() requires that, in a purchase transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section that is a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction or that involves improvements to be made on the property, or when the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.37(b)(1) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that will be disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) exceeds the sale price disclosed under § 1026.37(a)(7)(i), the amount of funds from the consumer is determined in accordance with § 1026.37(h)(1)(v). Section 1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(B) requires that, for all non-purchase transactions, the amount of estimated funds from the consumer is determined in accordance with § 1026.37(h)(1)(v). Pursuant to § 1026.37(h)(1)(v), the amount to be disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(A)() or (B) is determined by subtracting the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.37(b)(1) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that will be disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) (excluding any closing costs financed disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(ii)) from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction. The total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction is the sum of the amounts that will be disclosed on the Closing Disclosure in the summaries of transactions table under § 1026.38(j)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v), as applicable. When the result of the calculation is positive, that amount is disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii) as "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower," and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(v) as "Funds for Borrower." When the result of the calculation is negative, that amount is disclosed as a negative number under § 1026.37(h)(1)(v) as "Funds for Borrower," and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii) as "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower." When the result is $0, $0 is disclosed as "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" and "Funds for Borrower" under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii) and (v), respectively.

1. Section 1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(A) requires disclosure of a deposit in a purchase transaction. The deposit to be disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(A) is any amount that the consumer has agreed to pay to a party identified in the real estate purchase and sale agreement to be held until consummation of the transaction, which is often referred to as an earnest money deposit. In a purchase transaction in which no such deposit is paid in connection with the transaction, § 1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(A) requires the creditor to disclose $0. In any other type of transaction, § 1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(B) requires disclosure of the deposit amount as $0.
