###### Coverage written in connection with a transaction.

2.Coverage sold after consummation in closed-end credit transactions or after the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of ยง 226.5b is not "written in connection with" the credit transaction if the coverage is written because the consumer requests coverage after consummation or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of ยง 226.5b (although credit-sale disclosures may be required for the coverage sold after consummation if it is financed). Coverage sold before or after an open-end (not home-secured) plan is opened is considered "written in connection with a credit transaction."
