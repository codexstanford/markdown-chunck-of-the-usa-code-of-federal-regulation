#### Supplement I to Part 1005-Official Interpretations
##### Accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account.

1.The exception for "accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account" includes accounts that can be accessed by means other than EFTs, such as checks. If, however, an account may be accessed by any EFT other than preauthorized credits to the account, such as preauthorized debits or ATM transactions, the account does not qualify for the exception.
