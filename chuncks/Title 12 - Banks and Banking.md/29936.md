To be approved as an "underserved area," the proposed area must meet the CDFI definition of an "investment area."ยง 4702(16). A proposed area that, at the time the credit union applies, is designated in its entirety as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community (ยง 1391) automatically qualifies as an "investment area"; no further criteria of an "investment area" must be met.ยง 4702(16)(B). A proposed area that is not designated as such must qualify as an "investment area" under "the objective criteria of economic distress" developed by the CDFI Fund ("distress criteria") based on current decennial U.S. Census data, and also must have "significant unmet needs" for loans and financial services that credit unions are authorized to offer to their members.ยง 4702(16)(A).
