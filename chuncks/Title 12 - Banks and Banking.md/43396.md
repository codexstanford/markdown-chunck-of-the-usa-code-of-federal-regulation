###### Depositions when witness is unavailable.

(c)In addition to depositions permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, the hearing officer may grant a party's request for issuance of a subpoena if the requesting party shows that the prospective witness will likely give testimony material to the proceeding; that it is likely the prospective witness, who is then within the United States, will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment, other disability, or absence from the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party requesting the deposition; and that the taking of a deposition will serve the interests of justice.
