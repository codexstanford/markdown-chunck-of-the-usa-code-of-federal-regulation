(ii) Any other encumbrance period applicable to the lending transaction;

(2) If the national bank or Federal savings association received the off-balance sheet asset under an asset exchange, an RSF factor is assigned to the asset provided by the national bank or Federal savings association in the asset exchange as if the provided asset were encumbered for the longer of:

(i) The remaining maturity of the NSFR liability; and

(ii) Any other encumbrance period applicable to the provided asset; or

(3) If the national bank or Federal savings association did not receive the off-balance sheet asset under a lending transaction or asset exchange, an RSF factor is assigned to the on-balance sheet asset resulting from the rehypothecation of the off-balance sheet asset as if the on-balance sheet asset were encumbered for the longer of:

(i) The remaining maturity of the NSFR liability; and

(ii) Any other encumbrance period applicable to the transaction through which the off-balance sheet asset was received.
