##### Estimating the date.

2.When a covered person provides the disclosure required by this section that also describes a subsequent transfer, the date of the subsequent transfer may be estimated when the exact date is unknown at the time the disclosure is made. Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the covered person at the time the disclosure is made. The "reasonably available" standard requires that the covered person, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. The covered person normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. The covered person might make the disclosure using an estimated date even though the covered person knows that more precise information will be available in the future. For example, a covered person may provide a disclosure on March 31 stating that it acquired the loan on March 15 and that a transfer to another entity is expected to occur "on or around" April 30, even if more precise information will be available by April 14.
