For example, on January 5 a card issuer stops offering to the public an agreement it previously submitted to the Board. The card issuer must notify the Board that the agreement is being withdrawn by April 30, the first quarterly submission deadline after March 31, the last day of the calendar quarter in which the card issuer stopped offering the agreement.
