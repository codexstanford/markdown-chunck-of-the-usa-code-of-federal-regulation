#### PART 1202-FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
##### § 1202.6 What if my request does not have all the information FHFA requires?

If FHFA determines that your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, cannot be processed for reasons related to fees, or lacks required information, you will be informed in writing why your request cannot be processed. You will be given 15 calendar days to meet all requirements. If you are notified that your request cannot be processed for the reasons cited herein, your request will be placed on hold and will not be considered as being received by FHFA for the purpose of processing your request under this part.

(a) If you respond with all the necessary information, FHFA will process this response as a new request and the time period for FHFA to respond to your request will start from the date the additional information is actually received by FHFA.

(b) If you do not respond or provide additional information within the time period allowed, or if the additional information you provide is still incomplete or insufficient, FHFA will consider your request closed and will notify you that it will not be processed.
