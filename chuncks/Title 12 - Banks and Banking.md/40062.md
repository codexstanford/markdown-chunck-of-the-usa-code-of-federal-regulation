### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Format of disclosures.

1.The requirements of § 1026.20(c)(3)(i) and (ii) to provide the § 1026.20(c) disclosures in the same order as, and with headings and format substantially similar to, the model and sample forms do not preclude creditors, assignees, and servicers from modifying the disclosures to accommodate particular consumer circumstances or transactions not addressed by the forms. For example, in the case of a consumer bankruptcy or under certain State laws, the creditor, assignee, or servicer may modify the forms to remove language regarding personal liability. Creditors, assignees, and servicers providing the required notice to a consumer whose ARM is converting to a fixed-rate mortgage, may modify the model language to explain that the interest rate will no longer adjust. Creditors, assignees, and servicers electing to provide consumers with interest rate notices in cases where the interest rate adjusts without a corresponding change in payment may modify the forms to fit that circumstance. A payment-option ARM, which is an ARM permitting consumers to choose among several different payment options for each billing period, is an example of a loan that may require modification of the § 1026.20(c) model and sample forms. See appendix H-30(C) for an example of an allocation table for a payment-option loan.
