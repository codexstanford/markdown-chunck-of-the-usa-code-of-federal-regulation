#### Supplement I to Part 1030-Official Interpretations
##### Maturity dates on nonbusiness days.

1.In determining the term of a time account, institutions may disregard the fact that the term will be extended beyond the disclosed number of days because the disclosed maturity falls on a nonbusiness day. For example, a holiday or weekend may cause a "one-year" time account to extend beyond 365 days (or 366, in a leap year) or a "one-month" time account to extend beyond 31 days.
