###### ยง 327.16 Assessment pricing methods - beginning the first assessment period after June 30, 2016, where the reserve ratio of the DIF as of the end of the prior assessment period has reached or exceeded 1.15 percent.
####### Weighted average ROCA component rating.

(i)The weighted average ROCA component rating shall equal the sum of the products that result from multiplying ROCA component ratings by the following percentages: Risk Management-35%, Operational Controls-25%, Compliance-25%, and Asset Quality-15%. The weighted average ROCA rating will be multiplied by 5.076 (which shall be the pricing multiplier). To this result will be added a uniform amount. The resulting sum-the initial base assessment rate-will equal an institution's total base assessment rate; provided, however, that no institution's total base assessment rate will be less than the minimum total base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that assessment period nor greater than the maximum total base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that assessment period.
