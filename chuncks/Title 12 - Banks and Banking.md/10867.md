####### Acquisition of a loan to an affiliate.

(iv)A member bank purchases from a nonaffiliate a fixed-rate loan to an affiliate. The loan has an outstanding principal amount of $100 but, due to movements in the general level of interest rates since the time of the loan's origination, the member bank is able to purchase the loan for $90. The member bank initially must value the credit transaction at $90 (and must ensure that the credit transaction complies with the collateral requirements of ยง 223.14 at the time of its acquisition of the loan).
