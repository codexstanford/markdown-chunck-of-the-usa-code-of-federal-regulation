#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Non-federally related mortgage loans.

1.For a non-federally related mortgage loan, the creditor is not required to use form H-24 of appendix H to this part, although its use as a model form for such transactions, if properly completed with accurate content, constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of § 1026.37(o)(1)(i). Even when the creditor elects not to use the model form, § 1026.37(o)(1) requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else; contain only the information required by § 1026.37(a) through (n); and be provided in the same order as they occur in form H-24, using the same relative positions of the headings, labels, and similar designations as shown in the form. In addition, § 1026.37(o)(2) requires that the creditor include the designation of "estimated" for all headings, subheading, labels, and similar designations required by § 1026.37 for which form H-24 contains the "estimated" designation in such heading, subheading, label, or similar designation. The disclosures required by § 1026.37 comply with the requirement to be in a format substantially similar to form H-24 when provided on letter size (8.5&#x2033; x 11&#x2033;) paper.
