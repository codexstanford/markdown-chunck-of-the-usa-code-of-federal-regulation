(c)-(1)-(i)If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, an FDIC-supervised institution may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital requirement for the hedged exposure by substituting the PD associated with the rating grade of the protection provider for the PD associated with the rating grade of the obligor in the risk-based capital formula applicable to the guarantee or credit derivative in Table 1 of ยง 324.131 and using the appropriate LGD as described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. If the FDIC-supervised institution determines that full substitution of the protection provider's PD leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the FDIC-supervised institution may substitute a higher PD than that of the protection provider.
