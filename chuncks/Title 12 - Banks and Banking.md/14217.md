2.If the creditor does not know the precise credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures on the best information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are estimates under ยง 226.17(c)(2). If many of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as "all numerical disclosures except the late-payment disclosure are estimates") instead of separately labelling each estimate. In the alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items primarily affected by unknown information. (the commentary to ยง 226.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning the estimates and the contingencies that may affect the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to ยง 226.17(a)(1).
