### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Determination of applicable threshold.

2.A creditor must determine the applicable threshold by determining which category the loan falls into based on the face amount of the note (the "loan amount" as defined in § 1026.43(b)(5)). For example, for a first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount of $75,000, the loan would fall into the tier for loans greater than or equal to $66,156 (indexed for inflation) but less than $110,260 (indexed for inflation), for which the applicable threshold is 3.5 or more percentage points.
