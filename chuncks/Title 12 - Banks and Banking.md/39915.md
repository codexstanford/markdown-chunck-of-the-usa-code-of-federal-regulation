#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Multiple loan programs.

1.A creditor that offers multiple variable-rate loan programs is required to have disclosures for each variable-rate loan program subject to § 1026.19(b)(2). Unless disclosures for all of its variable-rate programs are provided initially, the creditor must inform the consumer that other closed-end variable-rate programs exist, and that disclosure forms are available for these additional loan programs. For example, the disclosure form might state, "Information on other adjustable rate mortgage programs is available upon request."
