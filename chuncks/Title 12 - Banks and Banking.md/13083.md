###### Construction financing.

4.If a transaction meets the definition of a residential mortgage transaction and the creditor chooses to disclose it as several transactions under ยง 226.17(c)(6), each one is considered to be a residential mortgage transaction, even if different creditors are involved. For example:

i. The creditor makes a construction loan to finance the initial construction of the consumer's principal dwelling, and the loan will be disbursed in five advances. The creditor gives six sets of disclosures (five for the construction phase and one for the permanent phase). Each one is a residential mortgage transaction.

ii. One creditor finances the initial construction of the consumer's principal dwelling and another creditor makes a loan to satisfy the construction loan and provide permanent financing. Both transactions are residential mortgage transactions.
