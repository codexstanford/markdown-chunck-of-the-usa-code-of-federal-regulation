##### Written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures.,et seq.

1.Section 1005.4(a)(1) generally requires that disclosures be made in writing; written disclosures may be provided in electronic form in accordance with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001). Because § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) provides that electronic disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) need not meet the consumer consent or other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act, § 1005.18(b) addresses certain requirements for written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures separately. Section 1005.18(b) also addresses specific requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures provided orally.
