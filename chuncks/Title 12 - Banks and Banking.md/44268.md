#### PART 1208 - DEBT COLLECTION
##### Subpart C - Administrative Offset
###### § 1208.42 Administrative offset prior to completion of procedures.
####### i.e.,

(b) The administrative offset is in the nature of a recoupment (FHFA may offset a payment due to the debtor when both the payment due to the debtor and the debt owed to FHFA arose from the same transaction); or

(c) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets, FHFA first learns of the existence of a debt due when there would be insufficient time to afford the debtor due process under these procedures before the paying agency makes payment to the debtor; in such cases, the Director shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practical and shall refund any money ultimately found not to be due to the Federal Government.
