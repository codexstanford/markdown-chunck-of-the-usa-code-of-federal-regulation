iv. A tax imposed on the credit transaction by a state or other governmental body, such as a documentary stamp tax on cash advances. (the commentary to § 1026.4(a)).

v. A membership or participation fee for a package of services that includes an open-end credit feature, unless the fee is required whether or not the open-end credit feature is included. For example, a membership fee to join a credit union is not an "other charge," even if membership is required to apply for credit. For example, if the primary benefit of membership in an organization is the opportunity to apply for a credit card, and the other benefits offered (such as a newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely incidental to the credit feature, the membership fee would be disclosed as an "other charge."

vi. Charges imposed for the termination of an open-end credit plan.
