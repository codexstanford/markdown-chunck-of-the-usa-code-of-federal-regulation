######## EE

(vi) If an FDIC-supervised institution captures the effect of a collateral agreement on EAD using the method described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculateusing the method in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section and keep that EE constant with the maturity equal to the maximum of:

(A) Half of the longest maturity of a transaction in the netting set, and

(B) The notional weighted average maturity of all transactions in the netting set.

(vii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR model must capture the basis between the spreads of any CDSthat is used as the hedging instrument and the hedged counterparty exposure over various time periods, including benign and stressed environments. If the VaR model does not capture that basis, the FDIC-supervised institution must reflect only 50 percent of the notional amount of the CDShedge in the VaR model.

(viii) If a FDIC-supervised institution uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to calculate the EAD for any immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the FDIC-supervised institution must use that EAD as a constant EE in the formula for the calculation of CVA with the maturity equal to the maximum of:

(A) Half of the longest maturity of a transaction in the netting set; and

(B) The notional weighted average maturity of all transactions in the netting set.
