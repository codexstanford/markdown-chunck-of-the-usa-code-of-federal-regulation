## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1026-TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Statement of differences.

1.Section 1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A) requires, as applicable, a statement that the consumer has increased or decreased this payment, along with a statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(1) or (j)(2), as applicable. The applicable disclosure to be referenced corresponds to the label on the Closing Disclosure under which the information accounting for the increase in the "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" amount is disclosed. For example, in a transaction that is a purchase as defined in § 1026.37(a)(9)(i), if the purchase price of the property has increased and therefore caused the "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" amount to increase, the statement, "You increased this payment. See details in Section K," with the words "increased" and "Section K" in boldface, complies with this requirement. In a purchase or refinancing transaction, in the event the amount of the credit extended by the creditor has decreased and therefore caused the "Down Payment/Funds from Borrower" amount to increase, the statement can read, for example, "You increased this payment. See details in Section L," with the same in boldface.
