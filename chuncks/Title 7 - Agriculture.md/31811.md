######## Determining the Federal share of the agricultural land easement.

(b)(1) Subject to the statutory limits, NRCS may provide up to 50 percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement. An eligible entity will provide a non-Federal share that is at least equivalent to the Federal share.

(2) The non-Federal share provided by an eligible entity may be comprised of-

(i) The eligible entity's own cash resources for payment of easement compensation to the landowner or for a buy-protect-sell transaction, the amount of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement, less the amount of the Federal share, that is provided through the conveyance of the agricultural land easement by the eligible entity;

(ii) A charitable donation or qualified conservation contribution (as defined by section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) from the landowner;

(iii) Where the amounts as identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are not sufficient to meet the non-Federal share amount, the eligible entity may also include the procured costs paid by the eligible entity to a third-party for an appraisal, boundary survey, phase-I environmental site assessment, title commitment or report, title insurance, baseline reports, mineral assessments, or closing cost; and

(iv) Where the amounts as identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are not sufficient to meet the non-Federal share amount, the eligible entity may also include up to 2 percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement for easement stewardship and monitoring costs provided by the eligible entity.

(3) NRCS may authorize a waiver to increase the Federal share of the cost of an agricultural land easement to an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement if-

(i) NRCS determines the lands to be enrolled are grasslands of special environmental significance as defined in this part,

(ii) An eligible entity provides a non-Federal share that is at least equivalent to the Federal share or comprises the remainder of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement, whichever is less, and

(iii) The eligible entity agrees to incorporate and enforce the additional necessary deed restrictions to manage and enforce the easement to ensure the grassland of special environmental significance attributes are protected.
