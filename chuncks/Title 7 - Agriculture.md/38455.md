######## "U" value

D.is the overall coefficient of heat transmission and is the combined thermal value of all the materials in a building section. U is the reciprocal of R. Thus U = 1/R or R = 1/U or 1/C where C is the thermal conductance and is the unit of measure of the rate of heat flow for the actual thickness of a material one square foot in area at a temperature of one degree Fahrenheit. The lower the U value, the higher the insulating ability.
