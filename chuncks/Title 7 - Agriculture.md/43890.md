####### Adequate security.

(a)A loan will be considered adequately secured only when all of the following requirements are met:

(1) RHS obtains at closing a mortgage on all ownership interests in the security property or the requirements of ยง 3550.58 are satisfied.

(2) No liens prior to the RHS mortgage exist at the time of closing and no junior liens are likely to be taken immediately after or at the time of closing, unless the other liens are taken as part of a leveraging strategy or the RHS loan is essential for repairs. Any lien senior to the RHS lien must secure an affordable non-RHS loan. Liens junior to the RHS lien may be allowed at loan closing if the junior lien will not interfere with the purpose or repayment of the RHS loan. When the junior lien involves a grant or a forgivable affordable housing product, the total debt may exceed the market value provided:

(i) The RHS loan is fully secured (with allowable exceptions for the tax service fee, appraisal fee, homebuyer education and initial escrow for taxes and insurance);

(ii) The junior lien is for an authorized loan purpose identified in ยง 3550.52; and

(iii) The grant or forgivable affordable housing product comes from a recognized grant source such as a Community Development Block Grant or a HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME).

(3) The provisions of 7 CFR part 1927, subpart B regarding title clearance and the use of legal services have been followed.

(4) Existing and proposed property improvements are totally on the site and do not encroach on adjoining property.
