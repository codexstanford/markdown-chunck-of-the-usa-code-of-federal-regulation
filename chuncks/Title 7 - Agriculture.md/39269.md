######## Utility-type facilities for new developing communities or areas.

(3)Developers are normally expected to provide utility-type facilities in new or developing areas and such facilities shall be installed in compliance with appropriate State statutes and regulations. Rural Development will be considered to an eligible applicant in such cases when failure to complete development would result in an adverse economic condition for the rural area (not the community being developed); the proposal is necessary to the success of an area development plan; and loan repayment can be assured by:

(i) The applicant already having sufficient assured revenues to repay the loan; or

(ii) Developers providing a bond or escrowed security deposit as a guarantee sufficient to meet expenses attributable to the area in question until a sufficient number of the building sites are occupied and connected to the facility to provide enough revenues to meet operating, maintenance, debt service, and reserve requirements. Such guarantees from developers will meet the requirements in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B) of this section; or

(iii) Developers paying cash for the increased capital cost and any increased operating expenses until the developing area will support the increased costs; or

(iv) The full faith and credit of a public body where the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds; or

(v) The loan is to a public body evidenced by a pledge of tax assessments; or

(vi) The user charges can become a tax lien upon the property being served and income from such lien can be collected in sufficient time to be used for its intended purposes.
