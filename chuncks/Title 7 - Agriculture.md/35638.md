###### Dielectric strength.

(2)(i) Arresters shall be removed for all dielectric strength tests.

(ii) Direct current potentials shall be applied between all line terminals and the equipment chassis and between these terminals and grounded equipment housings in all instances where the circuitry is dc open circuit from the chassis, or connected to the chassis through a capacitor. The duration of all dielectric strength tests shall be at least 1 second. The applied potential shall be at a minimum equal to the plus 3 sigma dc breakdown voltage of the arrester, provided by the line concentrator manufacturer.
