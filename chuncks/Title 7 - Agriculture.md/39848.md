######## Cooperative (co-op).

For the purposes of the HPG program, a cooperative (co-op) is one which:

(1) Is a corporation organized as a consumer cooperative;

(2) Will operate the housing on a nonprofit basis solely for the benefit of the occupants; and

(3) Is legally precluded from distributing, for a minimum period of 5 years from the date of HPG assistance from the grantee, any gains or profits from operation of the co-op. For this purpose, any patronage refunds to occupants of the co-op would not be considered gains or profits. A co-op may accept non-members as well as members for occupancy in the project.
