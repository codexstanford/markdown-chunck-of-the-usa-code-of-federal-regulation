###### ยง 3555.5 Environmental requirements.
####### Lender and loan applicant responsibilities.

(d)(1) Lenders must use due diligence in regard to potential environmental hazards to ensure the property is decent, safe and sanitary and of sufficient value to adequately secure the loan. The level of due diligence review to determine potential environmental hazards must be equivalent to the standards established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, or the VA.

(2) Mortgage loan transactions will be subject to the requirements of the 1994 National Flood Insurance Reform Act to determine if the dwelling is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).

(3) On an as needed basis, lenders and loan applicants will assist Rural Development in obtaining such information as Rural Development needs to complete its environmental review and to cooperate in the resolution of environmental problems.

(4) Lenders will become familiar with Agency environmental requirements, so they can advise applicants and reduce the probability of unacceptable applications being submitted to Rural Development.

(5) The lender must comply with Federally mandated flood insurance purchase requirements. Existing dwellings in a SFHA are not eligible under the SFHGLP unless flood insurance through the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is available for the community and flood insurance, whether NFIP, "write your own," or private flood insurance, is purchased by the borrower. The lender will require the borrower to obtain, and maintain for the term of the mortgage, flood insurance for any property located in a SFHA, listing the lender as a loss payee. Purchase of existing structures within the federally regulated floodplain will not require consideration of alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible development in floodplains;

(6) The borrower must obtain, and continuously maintain for the life of the mortgage, flood insurance on the security property in an amount sufficient to protect the property securing the guaranteed loan. Flood insurance policies must be issued under the NFIP, or by a licensed property and casualty insurance company authorized to participate in NFIP's "Write Your Own" program or private flood insurance policy, as approved by the lender. Lenders are required to accept private flood insurance policies, when purchased by a borrower, that meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 4012a (b)(1)(A). Lenders remain responsible to ensure a private flood insurance policy meets the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 4012a (b)(1)(A).

(7) Rural Development will not guarantee loans for new or proposed homes in an SFHA unless the lender obtains a final Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) that removes the property from the SFHA, or performs an alternatives analysis in compliance with the Agencies National Environmental Policy Act regulation and obtains a FEMA elevation certificate that shows that the lowest floor (including basement) of the dwelling and all related building improvements are built at or above the 100-year flood plain elevation in compliance with the NFIP.
