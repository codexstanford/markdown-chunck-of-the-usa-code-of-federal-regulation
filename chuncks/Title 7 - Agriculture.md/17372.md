####### Crop of economic significance.

A crop that has either contributed in the previous crop year, or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, ten percent (10%) or more of the total expected value of the producer's share of all crops grown in the county. However, a crop will not be considered a crop of economic significance if the expected liability under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is equal to or less than the administrative fee required for the crop.
