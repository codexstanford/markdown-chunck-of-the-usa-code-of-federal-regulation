######## Credit elsewhere determinations.

(b)The approval official must determine whether financing from commercial sources at reasonable rates and terms is available. If credit elsewhere is indicated, the approval official should inform the applicant and recommend the applicant apply to commercial sources for financing. To provide a basis for referral of only those applicants who may be able to finance projects through commercial sources, approval officials should maintain liaison with representatives of lenders in the area. The State Director should keep approval officials informed regarding lenders outside the area who might make loans in the area. Approval officials should maintain criteria for determining applications that should be referred to commercial lenders and maintain a list of lender representatives interested in receiving such referrals.
