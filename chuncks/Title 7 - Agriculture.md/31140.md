######## Yard waste

means any renewable biomass generated from municipal or residential land, such as urban forestry materials, construction or demolition materials, trimmings from grasses and trees, or biomass removed due to invasive species or weather-related disaster, that can be separated from and has low potential (such as contamination with plastics, metals, chemicals, or other toxic compounds that cannot be removed) for the generation of toxic by-products resulting from conversion, and that otherwise cannot be recycled for other purposes (such as post-consumer waste paper).
