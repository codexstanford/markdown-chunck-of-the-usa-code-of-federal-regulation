###### Interoffice trunk circuit requirements,General.

(h)-(1)(i) The bidder shall supply, as requested by the owner, solid-state technology type trunk and signaling circuits of any of the types described in RUS TE&CM 319, Interoffice Trunking and Signaling, or, with the approval of RUS, any other more recent and desirable types not as yet covered in the manual. For dc signaling, the duplex (DX) and loop types of signaling are preferred.

(ii) Trunks shall not be directly driven from the subscriber's dial on outward calls.

(iii) In order to reduce the spares inventory and minimize incidence of improper maintenance replacement of circuit assemblies, the types of trunk circuits shall be kept to a minimum. Variation in assemblies should be mainly limited to variation in signaling modes.

(iv) Trunk circuits which connect with carrier or 4-wire transmission facilities shall be arranged for 4-wire transmission to avoid an intermediate 2-wire interface between a 4-wire switching system and trunk facilities.
