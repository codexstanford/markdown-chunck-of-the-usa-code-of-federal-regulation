######### Determining CuSum values.

(c)At the beginning of the basic inspection period, the CuSum value is set equal to the starting value ("S") for the specified CuSum plan. The CuSum value is then determined for each consecutive sample unit as follows:

(1) Add the number of defects (or defectives) for the present sample unit to the CuSum value of the previous sample unit.

(2) Subtract the sample unit tolerance ("T").

(3) The CuSum value is reset in the following situations. However, determine compliance with the designated grade (see paragraph (d) of this section) prior to resetting the CuSum value:

(i) Reset the CuSum value to zero (0) if the CuSum value is less than zero (0).

(ii) Reset the CuSum value to the acceptance limit ("L") if the CuSum value exceeds the acceptance limit ("L").
