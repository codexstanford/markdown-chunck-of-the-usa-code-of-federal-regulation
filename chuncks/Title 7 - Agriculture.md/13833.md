####### ยง 273.20 SSI cash-out.
######## Receipt of SSI benefits.

(b)In California, an individual must actually receive, not merely have applied for, SSI benefits to be determined ineligible for SNAP. If the State agency provides payments at least equal to the level of SSI benefits to individuals who have applied for but are awaiting an SSI eligibility determination, receipt of these substitute payments will terminate the individual's eligibility for SNAP benefits. Once SSI benefits are received, the individual will remain ineligible for SNAP benefits, even during months in which receipt of the SSI benefits is interrupted, or suspended, until the individual is terminated from the SSI program.
