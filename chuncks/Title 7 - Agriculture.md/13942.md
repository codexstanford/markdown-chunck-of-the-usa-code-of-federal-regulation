(c)Under statutory requirements, a household is not eligible to participate in an S-SNAP unless it is receiving TANF assistance. If a household is not receiving TANF assistance (payments have not been authorized) at the time of its application for S-SNAP, the State agency must process the application using the regular SNAP requirements of ยง 273.2, including processing within the 30-day time frame, and screening for and provision of expedited service if eligible.
