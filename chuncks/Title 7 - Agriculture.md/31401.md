(e)(1) NRCS may allow a participant in a program contract terminated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section to retain a portion of any payments received appropriate to the effort the participant has made to comply with the program contract, or in cases of hardship, where NRCS determines that forces beyond the participant's control prevented compliance with the program contract.

(2) The condition that is the basis for the participant's inability to comply with the program contract must not have existed at the time the program contract was executed by the participant.
