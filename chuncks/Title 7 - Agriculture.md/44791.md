(2) Good causes, for purposes of occupancy terminations by a borrower, include actions such as:

(i) Actions by the tenant or a member of the tenant's household which disrupt the livability of the housing by threatening the health and safety of other persons or the right of other persons to enjoyment of the premises and related facilities;
