() A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest bearing accounts.

(B) Interest earned on Federal payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $500 per year may be retained by the non-Federal entity for administrative expense.

(xii) Not to sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise encumber the facility or any portion thereof or interest therein, and not to permit others to do so, without the prior written consent of the Government.

(xiii) Not to borrow any money from any source, enter into any contract or agreement, or incur any other liabilities in connection with making enlargements, improvements or extensions to, or for any other purpose in connection with the facility (exclusive of normal maintenance) without the prior written consent of the Government if such undertaking would involve the source of funds pledged to repay the debt to Rural Development.

(xiv) That upon default in the payments of any principal and accrued interest on the bonds or in the performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in the instruments incident to making or insuring the loan, the Government, at its option, may:

(A) Declare the entire principal amount then outstanding and accrued interest, due and payable;

(B) For the account of the association (payable from the source of funds pledged to pay the bonds or notes or any other legally permissiable source), incur and pay reasonable expenses for repair, maintenance and operation of the facility and such other reasonable expenses as may be necessary to cure the cause of default; and/or

(C) Take possession of the facility, repair, maintain and operate, or otherwise dispose of the facility. Default under the provisions of the resolution or any instrument incident to the making or insuring of the loan may be construed by the Government to constitute default under any other instrument held by the Government and executed or assumed by the association and default under any such instrument may be construed by the Government to constitute default hereunder.
