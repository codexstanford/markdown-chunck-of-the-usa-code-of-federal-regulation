####### ยง 1962.18 Unapproved disposition of chattel security.
######## Notice to borrowers.

(b)When a borrower has not properly accounted for the use of proceeds from the sale of chattel security, the County Supervisor must request restitution by use of a letter similar to Guide Letter 1962-A-5.

(1) If the borrower makes restitution or provides sufficient information to enable the County Supervisor to post-approve the transaction on the applicable Agency form, no further action will be taken against the borrower. Post-approval can only be given under the conditions set out in 1962.17(b) of this subpart. Only one such transgression can be allowed in any period covered by the RD 431-2, or other similar plan of operation acceptable to Rural Development, between annual security inspections, whichever is appropriate, and this must be made clear to the borrower.

(2) If the borrower does not make restitution, if the County Supervisor cannot post-approve the transaction, or if the borrower makes a second unauthorized disposition of security or a misuse of proceeds after settling the first offense as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the County Supervisor will proceed in accordance with ยง 1962.49 of this subpart.
