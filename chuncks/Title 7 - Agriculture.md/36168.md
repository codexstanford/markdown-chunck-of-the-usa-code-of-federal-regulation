###### Pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance.

(3)(i) The average capacitance unbalance as measured on the completed cable shall not exceed 574 pF/km (175 pF/1000 ft) when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a frequency of 1+/-0.1 kHz and a temperature of 23+/-3 &#xB0;C.

(ii) When measuring pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance all pairs except the pair under test are grounded to the shield except when measuring cable containing super-units in which case all other pairs in the same super-unit shall be grounded to the shield.

(iii) Pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance may vary directly with the length of the cable.
