(j) Assist rural water systems to comply with the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251) (FWPCA) or the SDWA when such failure to comply is directly related to a recent decline in quality of potable water. This would not apply to changes in the requirements of FWPCA or SDWA.

(k) Provide potable water to communities through means other than those covered above for no more than 120 days when a more permanent solution is not feasible in a shorter time frame. Where drinking water supplies are inadequate due to an event, including drought, severe weather, or contamination, potable water may be provided for a period of time, not to exceed an additional 120 days to protect public health.
