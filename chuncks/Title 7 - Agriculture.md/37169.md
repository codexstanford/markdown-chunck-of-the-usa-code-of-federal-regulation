####### Environmental review.

(a)Facilities financed by the Agency must undergo an environmental impact analysis in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and RUS procedures. Facility planning and design must not only be responsive to the owner's needs but must consider the environmental consequences of the proposed project. Facility design shall incorporate and integrate, where practicable, mitigation measures that avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts. Environmental reviews serve as a means of assessing environmental impacts of project proposals, rather than justifying decisions already made. Applicants may not take any action on a project proposal that will have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable project alternatives being reviewed prior to the completion of the Agency's environmental review.
