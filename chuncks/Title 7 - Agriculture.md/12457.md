######## Receipt of less donated foods than the commodity offer value.

(c)In certain cases, the school food authority may receive less donated foods than the commodity offer value in a school year. This "adjusted" value of donated foods is referred to as the adjusted assistance level. For example, the school food authority may receive an adjusted assistance level if:

(1) The distributing agency, in consultation with the school food authority, determines that the school food authority cannot efficiently utilize the commodity offer value of donated foods; or

(2) The school food authority does not order, or select, donated foods equal to the commodity offer value that can be cost-effectively distributed to it.
