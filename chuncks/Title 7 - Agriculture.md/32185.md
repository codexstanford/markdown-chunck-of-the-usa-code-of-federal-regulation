(50) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a Cooperator is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the Cooperator's domestic home office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Cooperator, whether for the Cooperator's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.
