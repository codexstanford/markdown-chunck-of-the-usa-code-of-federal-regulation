######## Filing and processing preapplications and applications.

F.See ยง 1980.451. All requirements of ยง 1980.451 remain in effect. But, in addition to the information required as part of a preapplication under ยง 1980.451(f), and unless previously submitted, as a part of an application under ยง 1980.451(i) evidence is required which demonstrates:

(1) The causal relationship between a 1988 natural disaster and the financial distress or loss upon which the preapplication or application is based; and,

(2) That the amount of the loan requested is not greater than the amount necessary for curing the problems caused by the natural disaster. Financial distress or loss shall be determined on the basis of a comparison of financial data for comparable periods of time and need not necessarily be based on data at the year's end. Evidence submitted may include, but is not limited to, the following:

(a) Evidence of financial loss or distress (including loss or distress caused by business interruption) resulting from physical damage caused by natural disaster, or

(b) Evidence that the financial loss and/or distress of the business is the direct or indirect result of loss of sales, business interruption, loss of markets, shortage of raw materials, or decline in patronage or customers caused by a natural disaster. It must be shown that business operations were damaged as a result of such natural disaster.
