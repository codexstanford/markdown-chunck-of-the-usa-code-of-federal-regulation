######## Standard contract.

(i)Each State agency shall develop a standard contract in accordance with ยง 226.21 and provide for its use between institutions and food service management companies. The contract shall expressly and without exception stipulate:

(1) The institution shall provide the food service management company with a list of the State agency approved child care centers, day care homes, adult day care centers, and outside-school-hours care centers to be furnished meals by the food service management company, and the number of meals, by type, to be delivered to each location;

(2) The food service management company shall maintain such records (supported by invoices, receipts or other evidence) as the institution will need to meet its responsibilities under this part, and shall promptly submit invoices and delivery reports to the institution no less frequently than monthly;

(3) The food service management company shall have Federal, State or local health certification for the plant in which it proposes to prepare meals for use in the Program, and it shall ensure that health and sanitation requirements are met at all times. In addition, the State agency may require the food service management company to provide for meals which it prepares to be periodically inspected by the local health department or an independent agency to determine bacteria levels in the meals being prepared. These bacteria levels shall conform to the standards which are applied by the local health authority with respect to the level of bacteria which may be present in meals prepared or served by other establishments in the locality. Results of these inspections shall be submitted to the institution and to the State agency;

(4) The meals served under the contract shall conform to the cycle menus upon which the bid was based, and to menu changes agreed upon by the institution and food service management company;

(5) The books and records of the food service management company pertaining to the institution's food service operation shall be available for inspection and audit by representatives of the State agency, of the Department, and of the U.S. General Accounting Office at any reasonable time and place, for a period of 3 years from the date of receipt of final payment under the contract, or in cases where an audit requested by the State agency or the Department remains unresolved, until such time as the audit is resolved;

(6) The food service management company shall operate in accordance with current Program regulations;

(7) The food service management company shall not be paid for meals which are delivered outside of the agreed upon delivery time, are spoiled or unwholesome at the time of delivery, or do not otherwise meet the meal requirements contained in the contract;

(8) Meals shall be delivered in accordance with a delivery schedule prescribed in the contract;

(9) Increases and decreases in the number of meal orders may be made by the institution, as needed, within a prior notice period mutually agreed upon in the contract;

(10) All meals served under the Program shall meet the requirements of ยง 226.20;

(11) All breakfasts, lunches, and suppers delivered for service in outside-school-hours care centers shall be unitized, with or without milk, unless the State agency determines that unitization would impair the effectiveness of food service operations. For meals delivered to child care centers and day care homes, the State agency may require unitization, with or without milk, of all breakfasts, lunches, and suppers only if the State agency has evidence which indicates that this requirement is necessary to ensure compliance with ยง 226.20.
