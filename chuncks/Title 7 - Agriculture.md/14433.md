####### General.

(1)The cost of service provided by other agencies may only include allowable direct costs of the service plus a pro rata share of allowable supporting costs and supervision directly required in performing the service, but not supervision of a general nature such as that provided by the head of a department and his staff assistants not directly involved in operations. However, supervision by the head of a department or agency whose sole function is providing the service furnished would be an eligible cost. Supporting costs include those furnished by other units of the supplying department or by other agencies.
