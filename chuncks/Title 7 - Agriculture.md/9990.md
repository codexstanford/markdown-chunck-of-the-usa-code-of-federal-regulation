######## Offer versus serve.

(ii)School food authorities that are Program sponsors may permit a child to refuse one or more items that the child does not intend to eat. The reimbursements to school food authorities for Program meals served under this "offer versus serve" option must not be reduced because children choose not to take all components of the meals that are offered. The school food authority may elect to use the following options:

(A) Provide meal service consistent with the National School Lunch Program, as described in part 210 of this chapter.

(B) Provide breakfast meals by offering four items from all three components specified in the meal pattern in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Children may be permitted to decline one item.

(C) Provide lunch or supper meals by offering five food items from all four components specified in the meal pattern in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Children may be permitted to decline two components.
