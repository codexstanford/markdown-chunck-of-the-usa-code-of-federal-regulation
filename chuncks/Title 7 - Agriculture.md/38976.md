######## Requests for Assistance.

J.Requests for assistance in targeted counties must meet all loan making requirements of the applicable program Instructions, except as modified for colonias in paragraph III of this exhibit. For section 515, States may:

1. Issue Form AD-622, "Notice of Preapplication Review Action," up to 150 percent of the amount shown in attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office).

2. All AD-622s issued for applicants in targeted counties will be annotated, in Item 7, under "Other Remarks," with the following: "Issuance of this AD-622 is contingent upon receiving funds from the Rural Housing Targeting Set Aside (RHTSA). Should RHTSA funds be unavailable, or the county in which this project will be located is no longer considered a targeted county, this AD-622 will no longer be valid. In these cases, the request for assistance will need to compete with other preapplications in non-targeted counties, based upon its priority point score."
