###### ยง 785.5 Fees for mediation services.

A requirement that non-USDA parties who elect to participate in mediation pay a fee for mediation services will not preclude certification of a State's mediation program or its eligibility for a grant; however, if participation in mediation is mandatory for a USDA agency, a State's Certified Mediation Program may not require the USDA agency to pay a fee to participate in a mediation.
