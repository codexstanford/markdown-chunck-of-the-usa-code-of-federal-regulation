(a) A recipient that provides private elementary or secondary education may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude a qualified handicapped person if the person can, with minor adjustments, be provided an appropriate education, as defined by § 15b.22(b)(1)(i). Each recipient to which this section applies is also subject to the provisions of §§ 15b.23 and 15b.26.
