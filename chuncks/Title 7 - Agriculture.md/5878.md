####### Liquid Media and Brix Measurements
######## ยง 52.773 Liquid media and Brix measurements.

(a) Brix measurement requirements for the liquid media in canned red tart pitted cherries are not incorporated in the grades of the finished product since sirup, or any other liquid medium, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purpose of the grades. The designation of liquid packing media and Brix measurements, where applicable, are as follows:

(b) The densities of the packing media, as listed in this section, are measured on the refractometer, expressed as percent by weight sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 &#xB0;C. (68 &#xB0;F.), but without correction for invert sugars or other substances. The Brix measurement of the packing media may be determined by any other method which gives equivalent results.

(c) Brix determination is made on the packing media 15 days or more after the cherries are canned or on the blended homogenized slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container if canned for less than 15 days.
