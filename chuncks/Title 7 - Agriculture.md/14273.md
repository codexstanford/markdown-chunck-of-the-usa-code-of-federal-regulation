###### ยง 276.7 Administrative review process.
####### Stay of administrative action.

(e)With one exception, the filing of a timely appeal and request for administrative review shall automatically stay the action of FNS to collect the claim asserted against the State agency until a decision is reached on the acceptability of the appeal, and in the case of an acceptable appeal, until a final determination has been issued. The exceptions to this provision are those claims that are asserted against State agencies due to State agency failure to comply with an order to reduce, suspend or cancel benefits in accordance with ยง 271.7. In situations where a State agency does not reduce, suspend or cancel benefits as directed and FNS takes action to disallow administrative funds or bill the State agency, the disallowance and/or billing shall remain in effect during the review process. Should the Appeals Board uphold the State agency, all disallowed funds and/or funds collected as a result of the billing shall be restored to the State agency promptly.
