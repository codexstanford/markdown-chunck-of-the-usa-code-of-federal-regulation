##### ยง 1755.404 Fiber optic cable telecommunications plant measurements.
###### Armor continuity.

(a)(1) Tests and measurements shall be made to ensure that the armor of fiber optic cables is continuous. There are two areas of concern. The first is armor bonding within a splice and the second is armor continuity between splices.

(2) Measurement techniques outlined here for verification of armor continuity are applicable to buried fiber optic cable plant. Measurements of armor continuity between splices in aerial, armored, fiber optic cable should be made prior to completion of splicing. Conclusive results cannot be obtained on aerial plant after all bonds have been completed to the supporting strand, multigrounded neutral, etc.
