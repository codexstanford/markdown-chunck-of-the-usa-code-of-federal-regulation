######## Evidence of and disbursement of other funds.

(6)Applicants expecting funds from other sources for use in completing projects being partially financed with Rural Development funds will present evidence of the commitment of these funds from such other sources. This evidence will be available before loan closing, or the start of construction, whichever occurs first. Ordinarily, the funds provided by the applicant or from other sources will be disbursed prior to the use of Rural Development loan funds. If this is not possible, funds will be disbursed on a pro rata basis. Rural Development funds will not be used to pre-finance funds committed to the project from other sources.
