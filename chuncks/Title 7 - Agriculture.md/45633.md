####### Affiliate.

Affiliate means individuals and entities are affiliates of each other when:

(1) One controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both. Factors such as ownership, management, current and previous relationships with or ties to another concern, and contractual relationships, shall be considered in determining whether affiliation exists. It does not matter whether control is exercised, so long as the power to control exists. Concerns owned and controlled by Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations (ANC), Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHO), Community Development Corporations (CDC), or wholly-owned entities of Indian Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs, are not considered to be affiliated with other concerns owned by these entities because of their common ownership or common management.

(2) There is an identity of interest between immediate family with identical or substantially identical business or economic interests (such as where the immediate family operate concerns in the same or similar industry in the same geographic area); however, an individual or entity may rebut that determination with evidence showing that the interests deemed to be one are in fact separate.
