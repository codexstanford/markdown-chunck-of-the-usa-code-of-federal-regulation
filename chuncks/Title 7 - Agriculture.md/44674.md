####### General.

(a)Borrowers hold final responsibility for housing project management and must ensure that operations comply with the terms of all loan or grant documents, Agency requirements and applicable local, state and Federal laws and ordinances. Project operations shall be conducted to meet the actual needs and necessary expenses of the property or for any other purpose authorized under Agency regulations. Any party not meeting these responsibilities may be subject to penalties. It is expected that only typical and reasonable expenses be incurred for the services rendered. Consequently, methods to inflate, duplicate, obscure, or failure to disclose the true nature and cost of work performed for the services rendered will cause the Agency to deny budget requests for the services or issue a demand for recovery and reimbursement for unauthorized actions.
