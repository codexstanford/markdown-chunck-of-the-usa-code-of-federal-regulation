(b)The processor must report reductions in donated food inventories on performance reports only after sales of end products have been made, or after sales of end products through distributors have been documented. However, when a recipient agency has contracted with a distributor to act as an authorized agent, the processor may report reductions in donated food inventories upon delivery and acceptance by the contracted distributor, in accordance with ยง 250.11(e). Documentation of distributor sales must be through the distributing or recipient agency's request for a refund (under a refund or rebate system) or through receipt of the distributor's automated sales reports or other electronic or written reports submitted to the processor (under an indirect discount system or under a fee-for-service system).
