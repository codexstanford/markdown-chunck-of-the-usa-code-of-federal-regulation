######## For On-line Sampling.

(b)The chance that a portion of production with a given level of quality will be accepted. Probability of acceptance is synonymous with "Percent of Production Expected to be Accepted." The probability of acceptance is normally designated as "Pa." In on-line sampling inspection, the probability of acceptance of any portion of production depends on the sample results obtained from the preceding portions. The probability of acceptance values associated with these procedures are the values which would be expected if a large number of samples are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans referenced in this standard, the probability of acceptance at the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting value ("S") associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the probability of acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic inspection period as close as possible to 95 percent.
