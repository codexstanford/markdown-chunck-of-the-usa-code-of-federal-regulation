####### Flexibility for individual circumstances.

(b)The intent of this subpart is to provide the flexibility to address the different needs and different credit risks of individual borrowers, and other special circumstances of individual lending situations. The model loan contract contained in appendix A of this subpart provides an example of what a loan contract with an "average" or "typical" distribution borrower may look like under "average" or "typical" circumstances. Depending on the credit risks and other circumstances of individual loans, RUS may execute loan contracts with provisions that are substantially different than those set forth in the model. RUS may develop alternative model loan contract provisions. If it does, such provisions will be made available to the public.
