######## CCC late interest.

(c)If CCC does not pay a claim within 15 business days of receiving the claim in good order, CCC late interest will accrue in favor of the holder of the payment guarantee beginning with the sixteenth business day after the day of receipt of a complete and valid claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. CCC late interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraph (b) of this section, and will be calculated at a rate equal to the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department of Treasury as of the due date. If there has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date CCC late interest begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate in a manner to be described on the USDA Web site.
