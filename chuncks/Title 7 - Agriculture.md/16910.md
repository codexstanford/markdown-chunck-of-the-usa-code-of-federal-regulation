###### Phytosanitary certificate for reexport.

A certificate (PPQ Form 579 or an approved electronic equivalent) issued by an inspector, giving the phytosanitary condition of foreign plants and plant products legally imported into the United States and subsequently offered for reexport. The certificate certifies that, based on the original foreign phytosanitary certificate and/or additional inspection or treatment in the United States, the plants and plant products are considered to conform to the current phytosanitary regulations of the receiving country and have not been subjected to the risk of infestation or infection during storage in the United States. Plants and plant products which transit the United States under Customs bond are not eligible to receive the phytosanitary certificate for reexport.
