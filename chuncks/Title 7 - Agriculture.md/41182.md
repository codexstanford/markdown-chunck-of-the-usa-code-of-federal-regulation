If Rural Development is able to guarantee the loan, it will provide the lender and the borrower with Form RD 449-14, listing all requirements for such guarantees. Rural Development will include in the requirements of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee a full description of the approved use of guaranteed loan funds as reflected in the Form RD 449-1.
