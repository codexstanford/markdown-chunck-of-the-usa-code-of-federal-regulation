######## Probate or administration proceedings.

(b)Generally, probate or administration proceedings are started by relatives or heirs of the deceased or by other creditors. Ordinarily, the Agency will not start these proceedings because of the problems of designating an administrator or other similar official, posting bond, and paying costs. If probate or administration proceedings are started by other parties or at the Agency's request, and any security is to be liquidated by the Agency instead of by the administrator or executor or other similar official, it will be liquidated in accordance with the advice of OGC. The State Director may request OGC to recommend that the U.S. Attorney bring probate or administration proceedings when it appears that:

(1) Such proceedings will not be started by other parties;

(2) The Agency's interests could best be protected by filing a proof of claim in such proceedings, and

(3) Public administrators or other similar officials or private parties, including banks and trust companies, are eligible to, and will serve as administrator or other similar official and will provide the required bond.
