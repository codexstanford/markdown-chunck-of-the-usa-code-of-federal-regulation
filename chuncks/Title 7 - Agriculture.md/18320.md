######## Division of cost-share payments.

(f)Federal cost-share payments made directly to suppliers of materials or services are credited to the land user who was issued the authorization. The remainder of the cost share is credited to the land user who carried out the remainder of the practice or identifiable unit. If more than one land user contributed to carrying out a practice or identifiable unit, the cost-share payment is to be divided proportionately according to the contribution made by each of the land users. Furnishing a landright or water right is not a contribution for cost-share payment purposes.
