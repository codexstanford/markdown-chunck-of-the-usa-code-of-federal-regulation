###### Certification of records.

(c)(1) Certification is the procedure by which a USDA official confirms that a copy of a record is a true reproduction of the original.

(2) When a request is received for a certified copy of a record that the component determines may be made available under the FOIA, each component will prepare a correct copy and a statement attesting that the copy is a true and correct copy.

(3) When any component determines that a record for which a certified copy is requested may be made available only in part, because certain portions of it are exempt from release under the FOIA, the component will process the record under the FOIA and make any needed redactions, including notations on the record as to the FOIA exemption(s) which require(s) the removal of the information redacted.

(4) The cost for certification of records is $5.00 each.
