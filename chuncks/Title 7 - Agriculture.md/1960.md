### PART 14 - DETERMINING THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES
#### ยง 14.6 Criteria for determining the primary purpose of payments with respect to potential exclusion from gross income.
##### Soil conservation.

(a)(1) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the purpose of soil conservation if they are intended to finance activities, measures, or practices to reduce soil deterioration.

(2) Soil deterioration refers to impairments of the physical or chemical properties of soil that are largely irreversible and that can be expected to result in a long-term or permanent reduction in the productive capacity of the resource regardless of the level of technology available or applied. Erosion by water and wind and the associated changes that result in permanent or long-term reductions in the productive capacity of the soil are forms of soil deterioration.
