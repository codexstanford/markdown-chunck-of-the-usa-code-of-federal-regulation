######## Actual average county yield

means the yield, which is calculated as the crop year production of a covered commodity in the county divided by the commodity's total planted acres for a crop year in the county.

(1) For wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley and oats, planted acres are the harvested acres plus unharvested acres.

(2) In determining the yield for a county, FSA uses data in order from the following data sources: RMA and yields determined by State committee.

(3) Separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields will be established in a county having farms with P&CP acreage history of a covered commodity in 2013 through 2017. These separate yields will be established where FSA determines the covered commodity's P&CP acreage was both irrigated and non-irrigated in 2013 through 2017.

(4) At FSA's discretion, FSA will calculate and use a trend-adjusted yield factor to adjust the yield taking into consideration, but not exceeding, the trend-adjusted yield factor that is used to increase yield history under the crop insurance endorsement under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524).
