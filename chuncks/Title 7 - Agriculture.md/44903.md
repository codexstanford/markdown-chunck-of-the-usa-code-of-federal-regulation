(iv) Court ordered settlement agreements, court ordered decrees, legal fees, or other costs that result from the filing of civil rights complaints or legal action alleging the borrower, or a representative of the borrower, has committed a civil rights violation. It is inappropriate to charge for legal services to represent any interest other than the borrower's interest (representing a general partner or limited partner to defend their individual owner interest is not allowable);

(v) Fines, penalties, and legal fees where the borrower or a borrower's representative has been found guilty of violating laws, including, but not limited to, civil rights, and building codes. Charging for payment of penalties including opposition legal fees resulting from an award finding improper actions on the part of the owner or management agent is generally an inappropriate project expense. The party responsible generally pays such expenses for violating the standards or by their insurance carriers;

(vi) Association dues unless related to training for site managers or management agents. To the extent that association dues can document training for site managers or management agents related to project activities by actual cost or pro-ration, a reasonable expense may be billed to the project;

(vii) Pay for bonuses or monetary performance awards to site managers or management agents that are not clearly provided for by the site manager salary contract;

(viii) Billing for parties or gifts to management agent staff;

(ix) Billing for practices that are inefficient such as routine use of collect calls from a site manager to a management agent office;
