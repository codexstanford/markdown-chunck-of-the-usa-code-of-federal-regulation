(a) The equation for predicting soil loss due to erosion for both the USLE and the RUSLE is(For further information about USLE see the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook 537, "Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses-A Guide to Conservation Planning," dated 1978. Copies of this document are available from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, DC 20013. For further information about RUSLE see the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook 703, "Predicting Soil Erosion by Water: A Guide to Conservation Planning with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE)."
