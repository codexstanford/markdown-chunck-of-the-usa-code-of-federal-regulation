####### Agricultural producer.

A person, including non-profits, directly engaged in the production of agricultural products through labor management and operations, including the cultivating, growing, and harvesting of plants and crops (including farming); breeding, raising, feeding, or housing of livestock (including ranching); forestry products; hydroponics; nursery stock; or aquaculture, whereby 50 percent or greater of their gross income is derived from the operations. The percentage is calculated as the average of gross agricultural operations income of the concern divided by the gross total income of the concern for the five most recent years. If the concern has been in operation for less than 60 months, use average gross agricultural operations income and gross total income for as long as the concern has been in operation.
