####### ยง 632.31 Cost-share payment.
######## Amount of cost-share payment.

(a)Cost-share payments are to be made at rates specified in the contract. The cost-share payment is to be determined by one of the following methods:

(1) Average cost.

(2) Actual cost but not more than the average cost.

(3) Specified maximum cost. If the average cost or the specified maximum cost at the time of starting the installation of a conservation practice or identifiable unit is less than the cost specified in the contract, payment is to be made at the lower rate. If the cost at the start of installation is higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A contract modification is necessary if NRCS determines that the higher cost is a significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. If costs are significant, cost-share payment is not to be made until the modification reflecting the increase is approved. If the higher costs are not significant, cost-share payments may be made if funds are available.
