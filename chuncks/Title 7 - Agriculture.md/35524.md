###### Central office tip cable splices.

(10)(i) Filled cable or filled splices are not recommended for use inside central offices, except in cable vault locations. Outside plant cable sheath and cable filling compound are susceptible to fire and will support combustion. Fire, smoke, and gases generated by these materials during burning are detrimental to telephone switching equipment.

(ii) Tip cables should be spliced in a cable vault. However, as a last resort, tip cables may be spliced inside a central office if flame retardant splice cases or a noncombustible central office splice housing is used to contain the splice.

(iii) Splices inside the central office shall be made as close as practical to the point where the outside plant cables enter the building. Except in cable vault locations, outside plant cables within the central office shall be wrapped with fireproof tape or enclosed in noncombustible conduit.
