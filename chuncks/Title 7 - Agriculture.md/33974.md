(2) The borrower has demonstrated the ability to obtain the funds that would be needed to complete other portions of the project, if the portion to be constructed with private loan funds could not be used productively without completion of such other portions, in the event concurrent RUS insured loan funds are not forthcoming. Such evidence may include financial records demonstrating the availability of general funds, and/or a written commitment from the private lender to provide a loan for the remaining amount of financing required, with such commitment being conditioned upon the availability of a lien accommodation from RUS; and

(3) An authorized official of the borrower has requested early approval of the lien accommodation and explained the reasons therefor, and has certified that the funds are needed and will be drawn down before funds from the concurrent insured loan are expected to be available, assuming that the insured loan is approved.
