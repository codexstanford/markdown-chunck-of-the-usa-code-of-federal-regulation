####### Creditworthiness.

(f)All loan applicants must have an acceptable credit history demonstrated by debt repayment. A history of failure to repay past debts as they came due (including debts to the Internal Revenue Service) when the ability to repay was within their control will demonstrate unacceptable credit history. Unacceptable credit history will not include isolated instances of late payments which do not represent a pattern and were clearly beyond the applicant's control or lack of credit history.
