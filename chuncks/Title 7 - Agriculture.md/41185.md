######## Transfer of lenders.

(a)The Rural Development State Director may approve a substitution of a new eligible lender in place of a former lender who holds an outstanding Conditional Commitment for Guarantee (where the Loan Note Guarantee has not yet been issued and the loan is within the State Director's loan approval authority) provided there are no changes in the borrower's ownership or control, loan purposes, scope of project and loan conditions in the Form RD 449-14 and the loan agreement remains the same. To effect such a substitution, the former lender will provide Rural Development with a letter stating the reasons it no longer desires to be a lender for the project. For loans in excess of the State Director's loan approval authority, National Office concurrence is required. The State Director will submit a recommendation concerning the transfer of lenders along with the lender's letter stating the reasons it no longer desires to be a lender for the project. The substituted lender will execute a new Part "B" of Form RD 449-1. If approved by Rural Development, the State Director will issue a letter or amendment to the original Form RD 449-14 reflecting the new lender and the new lender will acknowledge acceptance of the letter or amendment in writing.
