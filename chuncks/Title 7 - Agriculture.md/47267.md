####### Release of liability.

(c)The transferor, including any guarantor, may be released from liability only with prior Agency written concurrence and only when the fair market value of the collateral being transferred is at least equal to the amount of the loan being assumed and is supported by a current appraisal and a current financial statement of the transferee. The Agency will not pay for the appraisal. If the transfer is for less than the debt, for a release of liability, the lender must demonstrate to the Agency that the transferor and guarantors have no reasonable debt-paying ability considering their assets and income in the foreseeable future.
