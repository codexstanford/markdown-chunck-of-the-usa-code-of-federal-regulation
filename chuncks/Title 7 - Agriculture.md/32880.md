######## Allocation of recoveries.

(c)Recoveries received by CCC from any source whatsoever that are related to the obligation in default will be allocated by CCC to the holder of the payment guarantee and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default on the date the claim is paid by CCC. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment guarantee, CCC prorates any collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the payment guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the payment guarantee have been reimbursed in full.
