######### Failure to close.

(e)If a successful bidder fails to perform under the terms of the offer, the bid deposit will be retained as full liquidated damages. However, if a credit sale complying with the Rural Development notice is an element of the offer and Rural Development disapproves the credit application, then the bid deposit will be returned to the otherwise successful bidder. Upon determination that the successful bidder will not close, the State Director may authorize either another sealed bid or auction sale of direct negotiations with the next highest bidder, all available unsuccessful bidders, or other interested parties.
