####### Noncompliance.

(d)Where insured loan funds are found to have been advanced in noncompliance with this section, borrowers will be required to deposit the appropriate amount of the over-advance in the construction fund-trustee account and pay any accrued and unpaid interest to RUS. The Administrator will require borrowers, in order to remedy such noncompliance, to pay an additional amount equal to the interest on the funds over-advanced for the period such funds were outstanding, calculated at a rate equal to the difference between the RUS loan interest rate and the most recent rate at which RUS sold Certificates of Beneficial Ownership (CBO's). While RUS will generally permit the amount of over-advance deposited in the construction fund-trustee account to be subsequently used by the borrower for RUS approved projects, nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude RUS from exercising any rights or remedies which RUS may have pursuant to the loan contract.
