######## Credit facility mechanism.

(b)(1) For the purpose of the SCGP, CCC will consider applications for payment guarantees only in connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for the agricultural commodities will be made under an unconditional and irrevocable importer obligation to a U.S. exporter payable in U.S. dollars, as defined in ยง 1493.410(n).

(2) The exporter may assign the right to proceeds under the importer obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred payment date(s) as set forth in the importer obligation.

(3) The SCGP payment guarantee is designed to protect the exporter or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults, whether for commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the importer under the importer's obligation.
