####### Transmission lines.

(b)(1) All transmission line design data must be approved by RUS or a licensed professional engineer may certify that the design data, plans and profiles drawings for the electric system facilities meets all applicable RUS electric design requirements, specifications, local, state and national requirements and that RUS listed materials were used.

(2) Design data consists of all significant design features, including, but not limited to, transmission line design data summary, general description of terrain, right-of-way calculations, discussion concerning conductor and structure selection, conductor sag and tension information, design clearances, span limitations due to clearances, galloping or conductor separation, design loads, structure strength limitations, insulator selection and design, guying requirements, and vibration considerations. For lines composed of steel or concrete poles, or steel towers, in which load information will be used to purchase the structures, the design data shall also include loading trees, structure configuration and selection, and a discussion concerning foundation selection.

(3) Line design data for uprating transmission lines to higher voltage levels or capacity must be approved by RUS.

(4) Transmission line design data which has received RUS approval in connection with a previous transmission line construction project for a particular borrower is considered approved by RUS for that borrower, provided that:

(i) The conditions on the project fall within the design data previously approved; and

(ii) No significant NESC revisions have occurred.
