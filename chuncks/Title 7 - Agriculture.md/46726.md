###### ยง 4280.317 Selection of applications for funding.

All eligible applications received will be scored using the scoring criteria specified in ยง 4280.316 and funded in descending order from the highest total score to applications receiving 60 points, subject to the authorization of appropriations for the Federal FY. If two or more applications have the same score and available funds cannot fund the individual projects, the Administrator may prioritize such applications to help the program achieve overall geographic diversity.
