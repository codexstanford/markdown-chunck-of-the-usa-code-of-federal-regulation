####### Co-borrowers.

(2)Except for CF guaranteed loans in situations where any business or affiliate is dependent upon another's operations and are effectively one business or rely upon one another for loan repayment, they must be co-borrowers, unless waived by the Agency in writing when the Agency determines that adequate justification exists to not require the entities to be co-borrowers. Both co-borrowers must meet all requirements in this part. If the operating entity is truly independent and not reliant on another operation to remain viable or repay the debt, the Agency will allow one entity to be the sole borrower.
