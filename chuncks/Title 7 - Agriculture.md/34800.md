###### ยง 1735.92 Accounting considerations.

(a) Proper accounting shall be applied to all acquisitions and mergers, as required by the regulatory commission having jurisdiction, or in the absence of such a commission, as required by RUS based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or other accounting conventions as deemed necessary by RUS.

(b) If RUS determines that the plant accounts are not properly depreciated, the borrower should adjust its depreciation rates. Depending upon the characteristics of the case, commission jurisdiction and requirements, and similar factors, one of the following actions shall be taken:

(1) In states where commission approval of depreciation rates is required, a covenant shall be included in the loan contract that requires the borrower to:

(i) Have the consulting engineer make an original cost less depreciation inventory and appraisal of retained plant as part of the final inventory, and

(ii) Request commission approval of adjustments to its records on the basis of this inventory.

(2) In states where commission approval is not required, informal discussions between RUS and the borrower may be undertaken to reach satisfactory voluntary adjustments. If this does not resolve the situation to RUS's satisfaction, a covenant similar to that in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be included in the loan contract and the borrower shall agree to submit evidence satisfactory to the Administrator that it has adjusted its records on the basis of the inventory.
