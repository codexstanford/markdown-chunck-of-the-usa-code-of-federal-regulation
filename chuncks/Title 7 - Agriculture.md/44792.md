####### Lease expiration or tenant eligibility.

(b)A tenant's occupancy in an Agency-financed housing project may not be terminated by a borrower when the lease agreement expires unless the tenant's actions meet the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section, or the tenant is no longer eligible for occupancy in the housing. Borrowers must handle terminations of occupancy due to a change in tenant eligibility status in accordance with ยง 3560.158. At a minimum, the occupancy termination notice must include the following information:

(1) A specific date by which lease termination will occur;

(2) A statement of the basis for lease termination with specific reference to the provisions of the lease or occupancy rules that, in the borrower's judgment, have been violated by the tenant in a manner constituting material non-compliance or good cause; and

(3) A statement explaining the conditions under which the borrower may initiate judicial action to enforce the lease termination notice.
