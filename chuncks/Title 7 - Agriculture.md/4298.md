######## Double sampling plan.

(b)A sampling inspection scheme which involves use of two independently drawn but related samples, a first sample (n) and a second sample which is added to the first to form a total sample size (n). A double sampling plan consists of a first and total sample size with associated acceptance and rejection number(s). Inspection of the first sample leads to a decision to accept, to reject, or to take a second sample and the examination of a second sample, when required, always leads to a decision to accept or reject.
