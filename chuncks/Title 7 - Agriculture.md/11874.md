####### What are the penalties for committing program violations?

(b)If applicants or participants, or caretakers of applicants or participants, commit program violations, the State agency may require local agencies to disqualify the applicants or participants for a period of up to one year. However, if the local agency determines that disqualification would result in a serious health risk, the disqualification may be waived. For program violations that involve fraud, the State agency must require local agencies to disqualify the participant from CSFP for a period of up to one year, unless the local agency determines that disqualification would result in a serious health risk. The State agency must require local agencies to permanently disqualify a participant who commits three program violations that involve fraud. For purposes of this program, fraud includes:

(1) Intentionally making false or misleading statements to obtain CSFP commodities;

(2) Intentionally withholding information to obtain CSFP commodities; or

(3) Selling CSFP commodities, or exchanging them for non-food items.
