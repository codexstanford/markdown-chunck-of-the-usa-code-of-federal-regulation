###### Subpart D - Donated Foods in Contracts With Food Service Management Companies
####### ยง 250.51 Crediting for, and use of, donated foods.
######## Donated food values required in crediting.

(c)The recipient agency must ensure that, in crediting it for the value of donated foods, the food service management company uses the donated food values determined by the distributing agency, in accordance with ยง 250.58(e), or, if approved by the distributing agency, donated food values determined by an alternate means of the recipient agency's choosing. For example, the recipient agency may, with the approval of the distributing agency, specify that the value will be the average price per pound for a food, or for a group or category of foods (e.g., all frozen foods or cereal products), as listed in market journals over a specified period of time. However, the method of determining the donated food values to be used in crediting must be included in procurement documents and in the contract, and must result in the determination of actual values; e.g., the average USDA purchase price for the period of the contract with the food vendor, or the average price per pound listed in market journals over a specified period of time. Negotiation of such values is not permitted. Additionally, the method of valuation must ensure that crediting may be achieved in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and at the specific frequency established in procurement documents and in the contract.
