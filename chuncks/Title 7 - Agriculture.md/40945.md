Immediately on learning of the death of any person liable to the Agency, the County Supervisor will prepare Form RD 455-17, "Report on Deceased Borrower," to determine whether any special servicing action is necessary unless the County Supervisor recommends settlement of the indebtedness under subpart B of part 1956 of this chapter. If a survivor will not continue with the loan, it may be necessary to make immediate arrangements with a survivor, executor, administrator, or other interested parties to complete the year's operations or to otherwise protect or preserve the security.
