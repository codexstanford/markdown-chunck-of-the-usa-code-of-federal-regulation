(b)The Agency will use a point system to determine an eligible applicant's priority ranking for available loan funds. Points will be awarded only for factors indicated by well documented, reasonable plans which, in the opinion of the Agency, provide assurance that the work plan items have a high probability of being accomplished. Application content must contain sufficient information to assess the applicant's ability to manage an IRP revolving loan fund and allow the Agency to assign priority points in accordance with the criteria discussed in this section. The Agency will award points using the criteria identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section. Any application that does not meet the minimum value for receiving points associated with a criterion will receive no points for that criterion.
