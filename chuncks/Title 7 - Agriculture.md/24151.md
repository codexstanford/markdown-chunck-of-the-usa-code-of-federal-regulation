(2) The grower must furnish the Board with a total harvested production amount so the Board can calculate the amount of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificate.

(3) The grower must agree to allow a Board compliance officer to visit the grower's orchard to confirm that diversion has actually taken place.
