####### Reduction of loss claims payable.

(d)(1) Negligent loan origination and negligent loan servicing will result in a reduction of loss claims payable under the guarantee to the lender if any losses have occurred as the result of such negligence. The Agency will assess against the lender any cost to the Agency associated with actions taken by the Agency necessary to protect the Agency's interests with respect to the loan where a lender is not in compliance with its origination and servicing responsibilities. The extent of the reduction, which could be a total reduction of the loss claims payable, will depend on the extent of the losses incurred as a result of the negligent loan origination or servicing.

(2) Non-compliance with the requirements of ยง 5001.205(a) or ยง 5001.305(a) will result in a reduction of loss claims payable. The Agency's review of the non-compliance could result in a total reduction of the loss claim payable.

(3) Any delinquent fees, including any interest due thereon, will be deducted from any loss payment due the lender.
