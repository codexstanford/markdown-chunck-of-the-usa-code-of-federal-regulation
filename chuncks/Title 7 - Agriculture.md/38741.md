######## Disbursement of loan funds.

(a)When the closing agent indicates that the conditions necessary to close the loan have been met, loan funds will be forwarded to the closing agent. Loan funds will not be disbursed prior to filing of the mortgage for record; however, when necessary, loan funds may be placed in escrow before the mortgage is filed for record and disbursed after it is filed. No development funds will be kept in escrow by the closing agent after loan closing, unless approved by the agency. Loan funds for the payment of a lien may be disbursed only upon the recording of a discharge, satisfaction, or release of prior lien interests (or assignment where necessary to protect the interests of the agency).
