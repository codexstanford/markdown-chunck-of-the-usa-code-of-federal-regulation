####### Additions to the list of organisms granted exceptions from permitting requirements for their importation, interstate movement, or release.,pest.permits@usda.gov,http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/permits/index.shtml.

(c)Any person may request that APHIS add a biological control organism to the list referred to in paragraph (b) of this section by submitting a petition to APHIS via email toor through any means listed atThe petition must include the following information:

(1) Evidence indicating that the organism is indigenous to the continental United States throughout its geographical or ecological range, or evidence indicating that the organism has produced self-replicating populations within the continental United States for an amount of time sufficient, based on the organism's taxon, to consider that taxon established throughout its geographical or ecological range in the continental United States; or

(2) Evidence that the organism's geographical or ecological range includes an extremely limited area of or none of the continental United States based on its inability to maintain year to year self-replicating populations despite repeated introductions over a sufficient range of time; or

(3) The petition would include evidence that the organism cannot establish anywhere in the continental United States; or

(4) Results from a field study where data were collected from representative habitats occupied by the biological control organism. Studies must include sampling for any direct or indirect impacts on target and non-target hosts of the biological control organism in these habitats. Supporting scientific literature must be cited; or

(5) Any other data, including published scientific reports, that suggest that subsequent releases of the organism into the environment of the continental United States will present no additional plant pest risk (direct or indirect) to plants or plant products.
