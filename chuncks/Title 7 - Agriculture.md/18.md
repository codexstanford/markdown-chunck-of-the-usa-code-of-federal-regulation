###### Adverse determinations of requests.

(g)A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect will notify the requester of that determination in writing. The written communication to the requester will include the name and title of the person responsible for the adverse determination, if other than the official signing the letter; a brief statement of the reason(s) for the determination, including any exemption(s) applied in denying the request; an estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation; a statement that the determination may be appealed, followed by a description of the requirements to file an appeal; and a statement advising the requester that he or she has the right to seek dispute resolution services from the component's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services ("OGIS"). An adverse determination includes:

(1) A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part;

(2) A determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be found, when no responsive records are located and released;

(3) A determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the format sought by the requester;

(4) A determination on any disputed fee matter; or

(5) A denial of a request for expedited treatment.

(h) Upon request, the component will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the component may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.
