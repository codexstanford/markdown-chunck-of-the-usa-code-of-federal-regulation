###### ยง 4287.158 Determination of loss and payment.
####### Estimated loss.

(b)In accordance with the requirements of ยง 4287.157(f), the lender must prepare an estimated loss claim, based on liquidation appraisal value, and submit it to the Agency. When the lender is conducting the liquidation and owns any or all of the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender must file an estimated loss claim once a decision has been made to liquidate if the liquidation will exceed 90 days. The estimated loss payment will be based on the liquidation value of the collateral.

(1) Such estimate will be prepared and submitted by the lender on Form RD 449-30 using the basic formula as provided on the report, except that the liquidation appraisal value will be used in lieu of the amount received from the sale of collateral. Interest accrual eligible for payment under the guarantee on the defaulted loan will be discontinued when the estimated loss is paid.

(2) A protective advance claim will be paid only at the time of the final report of loss payment.
