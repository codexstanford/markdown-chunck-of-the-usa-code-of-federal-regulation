####### ยง 1051.60 Handler's value of milk.

For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in ยง 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the values computed in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in ยง 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under ยง 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.
