(C) The use of deductibles,, an initial amount of each claim to be paid by the applicant/borrower, may be allowed by Rural Development providing the applicant/borrower has financial resources which would likely be adequate to cover potential claims requiring payment of the deductible.

(D) Borrowers must provide evidence to Rural Development that adequate insurance and fidelity bond coverage is being maintained. This may consist of a listing of policies and coverage amounts in yearend reports submitted with management reports required under ยง 1942.17(q)(2) or other documentation. The borrower is responsible for updating and/or renewing policies or coverage which expire between submissions to Rural Development. Any monitoring of insurance and fidelity bond coverage by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is solely for the benefit of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, and does not relieve the applicant/borrower of its obligation under the loan resolution to maintain such coverage.
