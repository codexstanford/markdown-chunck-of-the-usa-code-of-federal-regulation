###### ยง 1710.102 Borrower eligibility for different types of loans.
####### One hundred percent loan guarantees under section 306.

(c)Both distribution and power supply borrowers are eligible for 100 percent loan guarantees under section 306 of the RE Act for any or all of the purposes set forth in ยง 1710.106, including, under certain circumstances, the implementation of demand side management, energy conservation programs, and on grid and off grid renewable energy systems. (See 7 CFR part 1712). These guarantees are normally used to finance bulk transmission and generation facilities, but they may also be used to finance distribution and subtransmission facilities. If a borrower applies for a section 306 loan guarantee to finance all or a portion of distribution and subtransmission facilities, such request will not affect the borrower's eligibility for an insured loan to finance any remaining portion of said facilities or for any future insured loan to finance other distribution or subtransmission facilities. A section 306 loan guarantee, however, may not be used to guarantee a supplemental loan required by ยง 1710.110.
