####### ยง 273.8 Resource eligibility standards.
######## Jointly owned resources.

(d)Resources owned jointly by separate households shall be considered available in their entirety to each household, unless it can be demonstrated by the applicant household that such resources are inaccessible to that household. If the household can demonstrate that it has access to only a portion of the resource, the value of that portion of the resource shall be counted toward the household's resource level. The resource shall be considered totally inaccessible to the household if the resource cannot practically be subdivided and the household's access to the value of the resource is dependent on the agreement of a joint owner who refuses to comply. For the purpose of this provision, ineligible aliens or disqualified individuals residing with the household shall be considered household members. Resources shall be considered inaccessible to persons residing in shelters for battered women and children, as defined in ยง 271.2, if

(1) The resources are jointly owned by such persons and by members of their former household; and

(2) The shelter resident's access to the value of the resources is dependent on the agreement of a joint owner who still resides in the former household.
