####### ยง 319.41b Administrative instructions prescribing conditions for entry of broomstraw without treatment.

Broomstraw, sometimes referred to as "combed stalkless", when consisting of individual straws entirely free from stems, stalks, stubs of stalks, and leaves, may be imported from all countries without seasonal limitation through ports of entry designated in the permit, provided it is bundled and baled to prevent breakage and scattering and to facilitate inspection, in the following manner:

(a) The broomstraw shall be assembled into bundles with the base of the individual straws at the same end, no alternating of layers being permitted.

(b) Each bundle shall be securely tied to prevent breakage.

(c) Individual bundles shall be compacted, grouped into bales, and so arranged that the butt of each bundle is exposed on the outside of the bale.

(d) Each bale shall be securely bound to prevent shifting or loosening of the bundles in transit.

(e) Broomstraw found upon inspection at the port of entry to contain stems, stalks, stubs of stalks, or leaves shall be sterilized under the supervision of an inspector. Broomstraw contaminated in the aforesaid manner, from countries other than those on the North or South American Continents or the West Indies, shall be considered as broomcorn and shall be subject to compliance with ยง 319.41-3(b).
