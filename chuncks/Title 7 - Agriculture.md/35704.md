###### Applicable results,Insertion loss.

(6)-(i)(A) For D66 loaded cables (a specific loading scheme using a 66 millihenry inductor spaced nominally at 4,500 ft [1,371 m] intervals) measured at a point one-half section length beyond the last load point, the measured nonrepeated insertion loss shall be within +/-10% at 1000, 1700, 2300, and 2800 Hz, +/-15% at 3400 Hz and +/-20% at 4000 Hz of the calculated insertion loss at the same frequencies and temperature.

(B) For H88 loaded cables (a specific loading scheme using an 88 millihenry inductor spaced nominally at 6,000 ft [1,829 m] intervals) measured at a point one-half section length beyond the last load point, the measured nonrepeatered insertion loss shall be within +/-10% at 1000, 1700, and 2300 Hz, +/-15% at 2800 Hz, and +/-20% at 3400 Hz of the calculated insertion loss at the same frequencies and temperature.

(C) For nonloaded cables, the measured insertion loss shall be within +/-10% at 1000, 1700, 2300, and 2800 Hz, +/-15% at 3400 Hz and +/-20% at 4000 Hz of the calculated insertion loss at the same frequencies and temperature.

(D) For loaded cables, the calculated loss at each desired frequency shall be computed as follows:
