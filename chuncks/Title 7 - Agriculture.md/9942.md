######## Denial of applications and termination of sponsors.

(c)Except as specified below, the State agency shall not enter into an agreement with any applicant sponsor identifiable through its corporate organization, officers, employees, or otherwise, as an institution which participated in any Federal child nutrition program and was seriously deficient in its operation of any such program. The State agency shall terminate the Program agreement with any sponsor which it determines to be seriously deficient. However, the State agency shall afford a sponsor reasonable opportunity to correct problems before terminating the sponsor for being seriously deficient. The State agency may approve the application of a sponsor which has been disapproved or terminated in prior years in accordance with this paragraph if the sponsor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State agency that the sponsor has taken appropriate corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the deficiencies. Serious deficiencies which are grounds for disapproval of applications and for termination include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

(1) Noncompliance with the applicable bid procedures and contract requirements of Federal child nutrition program regulations;

(2) The submission of false information to the State agency;

(3) Failure to return to the State agency any start-up or advance payments which exceeded the amount earned for serving meals in accordance with this part, or failure to submit all claims for reimbursement in any prior year, provided that failure to return any advance payments for months for which claims for reimbursement are under dispute from any prior year shall not be grounds for disapproval in accordance with this paragraph; and

(4) Program violations at a significant proportion of the sponsor's sites. Such violations include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Noncompliance with the meal service time restrictions set forth at ยง 225.16(c);

(ii) Failure to maintain adequate records;

(iii) Failure to adjust meal orders to conform to variations in the number of participating children;
