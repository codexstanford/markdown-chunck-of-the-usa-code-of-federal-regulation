######### Commission.

(b)Rural Development may not set the commission rate in an auctioneer solicitation/contract. The rate of commission will be one of the evaluation criteria in the solicitation. However, any offeror that submits an offer with a commission rate lower than the typical rate for such services in the area must include documentation that they have successfully sold properties at the lower rate with no compromise in services. The solicitation/contract will explicitly detail this policy. Commissions will be paid at closing if sufficient cash to cover the commission is paid by the purchaser. Otherwise, the commission will be paid by the appropriate Rural Development official completing Form AD-838 and processing Form RD 838-B for payment in accordance with the respective FMI's, and charged to the inventory account as a nonrecoverable cost.
