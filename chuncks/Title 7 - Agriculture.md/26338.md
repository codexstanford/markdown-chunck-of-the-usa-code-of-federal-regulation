The handler shall furnish promptly to the inspector two copies of the shipping or disposition order or other documents which shall show the date of each shipment or disposition, the applicable reference number thereof, and an adequate description of the shipment or disposition. One copy of each document so furnished shall be required to be forwarded to the committee.
