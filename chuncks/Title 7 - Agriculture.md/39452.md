######## Second preference-single instruments with amortized installments.

(2)If Form RD 440.22 is not legally permissible, use a single instrument providing for amortized installments. Show the full amount of the loan on the face of the document and provide for entering the date and amount of each Rural Development advance on the reverse thereof or on an attachment to the instrument. Form RD 440-22 should be followed to the extent possible. When principal payment is deferred, no attempt should be made to compute in dollar terms the amount of interest due on these installment dates. Rather the instrument should provide that "interest only" is due on these dates. The appropriate amortized installment computed as follows will be shown due on the installment date thereafter.
