######### Sealed bid sales.

(d)Section 1955.147 of this subpart provides detailed guidance on sealed bid sales applicable to the sale of chattels. When it is believed that financing will have to be provided through a credit sale, this method has advantages over auction sales. It requires, however, additional steps in the event any established minimum price is not obtained. Preference will be given to a cash offer which is at least ____* percent of the highest offer requiring credit.
