####### Additional reporting requirements.,i.e.

(e)OAO may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the "Remarks" section of the report; and when practical and deemed necessary, OAO may require awardees to report in the "Remarks" section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days (, short narrative with explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances). When OAO needs additional information or more frequent reports, a special provision will be added to the award terms and conditions and identified in the OAO award agreement. Should OAO determine that an awardee's accounting system is inadequate, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be requested from the awardee until such time as the system is brought up to standard, as determined by OAO. This additional reporting requirement will be required via a special provision to the award terms and conditions of the OAO award agreement.
