######### (B) classification.

(b)Frozen red tart pitted cherries that possess a reasonably good red color may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). "Reasonably good red color" means that the cherries possess a color that is reasonably bright and typical of properly ripened cherries and that is reasonably uniform in that the number of cherries that vary markedly from this color due to oxidation, improper processing, or other causes, or that are undercolored, does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
