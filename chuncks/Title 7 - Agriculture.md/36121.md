###### Pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance,Pair-to-ground.

(3)-(i)The capacitance unbalance as measured on the individual pairs of the completed wire must not exceed 2625 pF/km (800 pF/1000 ft) when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a frequency of 1.0 +/-0.1 kHz and a temperature of 23 +/-3 &#xB0;C.

(ii) When measuring pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance, all pairs, except the pair under test, are grounded to the shield.

(iii) Pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance may vary directly with the length of the wire.
