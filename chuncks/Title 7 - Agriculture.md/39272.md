(2)Each borrower will be required to establish and maintain reserves sufficient to assure that loan installments will be paid on time, for emergency maintenance, for extensions to facilities, and for replacement of short-lived assets which have a useful life significantly less than the repayment period of the loan. It is expected that borrowers issuing bonds or other evidences of debt pledging facility revenues as security will ordinarily plan their reserve to provide for a total reserve in an amount at least equal to one average loan installment. It is also expected the ordinarily such reserve will be accumulated at the rate of at least one-tenth of the total each year until the desired level is reached.
