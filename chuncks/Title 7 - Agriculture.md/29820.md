######## Benchmark revenue for ARC-CO

is calculated as the product obtained by multiplying the average historical county yield times the average MYA price for the most recent 5 crop years available, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and lowest prices and substituting the effective reference price in each year where the MYA price is less than the effective reference price. If a county has separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields established for a covered commodity, the benchmark revenue calculated by FSA for that farm and covered commodity will be weighted based on the farm's historical irrigated percentage.
