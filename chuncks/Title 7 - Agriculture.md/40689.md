######## Nonprogram (NP) terms.

Credit terms for SFH or MFH property sales, offered for the convenience of the Government to facilitate sales; more stringent than terms offered under Rural Development's loan programs. Applicable when the purchaser does not meet program eligibility requirements or when the property is classified as nonprogram (NP). Loans made on NP terms are classified as NP loans and are serviced accordingly. For property other than SFH and MFH, see the definition of "Ineligible terms."
