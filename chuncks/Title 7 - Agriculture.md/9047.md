######### Nonsynthetics allowed.

(a)

(1) Acids (Citric-produced by microbial fermentation of carbohydrate substances; and Lactic).

(2) Agar-agar.

(3) Animal enzymes-(Rennet-animals derived; Catalase-bovine liver; Animal lipase; Pancreatin; Pepsin; and Trypsin).

(4) Attapulgite-as a processing aid in the handling of plant and animal oils.

(5) Bentonite.

(6) Calcium carbonate.

(7) Calcium chloride.

(8) Calcium sulfate-mined.

(9) Carrageenan.

(10) Diatomaceous earth-food filtering aid only.

(11) Enzymes-must be derived from edible, nontoxic plants, nonpathogenic fungi, or nonpathogenic bacteria.

(12) Flavors-nonsynthetic flavors may be used when organic flavors are not commercially available. All flavors must be derived from organic or nonsynthetic sources only and must not be produced using synthetic solvents and carrier systems or any artificial preservative.

(13) Gellan gum (CAS # 71010-52-1)-high-acyl form only.

(26) Sodium bicarbonate.

(27) Sodium carbonate.

(28) Tartaric acid-made from grape wine.

(29) Waxes-nonsynthetic (Wood rosin).

(30) Yeast-When used as food or a fermentation agent in products labeled as "organic," yeast must be organic if its end use is for human consumption; nonorganic yeast may be used when organic yeast is not commercially available. Growth on petrochemical substrate and sulfite waste liquor is prohibited. For smoked yeast, nonsynthetic smoke flavoring process must be documented.
