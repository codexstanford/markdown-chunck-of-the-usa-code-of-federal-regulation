####### Food orders.

(b)When NCP Program processors request donated food, FNS will determine whether the quantities ordered are consistent with the processor's ability to sell end products and/or the processor's past demonstrated performance under the Program. If the quantities are appropriate, FNS will request from CCC the donated food for transfer of title to FNS and delivery to a mutually agreed upon location for use by the NCP Program processor. The title to these commodities transfers to FNS upon their acceptance by the processor. FNS retains title to such commodities until:

(1) They are distributed to eligible recipient agencies in processed form, at which time the recipient agency takes title;

(2) They are disposed of because they are damaged or out-of-condition; or

(3) Title is transferred to the NCP Program processor upon termination of the agreement.
