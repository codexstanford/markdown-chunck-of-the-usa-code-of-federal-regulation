####### Transfers and diversions to pool plants.

(a)Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant or a handler described in § 1135.11 of this chapter to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk unless the handlers both request the same classification in another class. In either case, the classification shall be subject to the following conditions:

(1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, remaining in such class at the receiving plant after the computations pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

(2) If the transferring plant received during the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3) or the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and

(3) If the transferring handler received during the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) or (9) or the corresponding steps of § 1000.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the receiving plant.
