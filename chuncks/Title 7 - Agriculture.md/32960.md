######## Allocation of recoveries.

(c)Recoveries made by CCC from the importer, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment guarantee, CCC pro rates any collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. Appendix A to ยง 1493.520-Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of Recoveries-provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).
