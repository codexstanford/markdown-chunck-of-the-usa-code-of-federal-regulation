######## What constitutes a gratuity.

(b)For the purposes of these regulations, the term "gratuity" shall include any favor, entertainment, gift, tip, loan, payment for unauthorized or fictitious work, unusual discount, or anything of monetary value. The term shall not include (1) the occasional exchange of a cup of coffee or similar social courtesies of nominal value in a business or work relationship if the exchange is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; (2) the acceptance of unsolicited advertising material such as pencils, pens, and note pads of nominal value if the material is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; and (3) the exchange of the usual courtesies in an obvious family or personal relationship (including those between official personnel and their parents, spouses, children, or close personal friends) when the circumstances make it clear that the exchange is the result of the family or personal relationship, rather than a business or work relationship.
