######## Fund transfer agreements.

(b)When it is impractical for NRCS to enter into agreements with local soil conservation districts, State soil and water conservation agencies, or State water quality agencies to administer the program in a project area, USDA will retain program administration. In this case, the State Executive Director, ASCS, and the State Conservationist, NRCS, are to enter into an agreement for the transfer of funds to ASCS through county ASC committees for activities included in administrative cost (ยง 634.5(c)) and BMP cost (ยง 634.5(j)). The following general working arrangements are to apply:

(1) Administering contracts, making cost-share payment, and program reporting are to be provided by ASCS as the administering agency.

(2) NRCS, or its designee, with appropriate Federal or State agency support, will provide technical assistance to participants in preparing RCWP contracts and in carrying out their water-quality plans.
