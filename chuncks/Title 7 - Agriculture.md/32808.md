######## Previous qualification.

(c)Any seller that is currently qualified under subpart B of this part, § 1493.30, need only provide the information requested in § 1493.220(a)(4). Once CCC receives that information, CCC will notify the seller that the seller is qualified under this section to submit applications for an FGP payment guarantee, and the other information provided by the seller pursuant to § 1493.30 will be deemed to also have been provided under this section. Any seller not submitting an application for a GSM-102 or FGP payment guarantee for two consecutive U.S. Government fiscal years must resubmit a qualification application containing the information specified in § 1493.220(a) to CCC to participate in the FGP. If at any time the information required by paragraph (a) of this section changes, the seller must promptly contact CCC to update this information and certify that the remainder of the information previously provided under paragraph (a) of this section has not changed.
