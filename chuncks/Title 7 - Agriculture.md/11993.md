######## Coordination with WIC agency.

(e)The Chief Executive Officer of the State shall ensure coordination between the designated administering State agency and the WIC State agency, if different, by ensuring that the two agencies enter into a written agreement. Such coordination between agencies is necessary for the successful operation of the FMNP, because WIC participants or persons on the waiting list for WIC services are the only persons eligible to receive Federal benefits under the FMNP. The written agreement shall delineate the responsibilities of each agency, describe any compensation for services, and shall be signed by the designated representative of each agency. This agreement shall be submitted each year along with the State Plan.
