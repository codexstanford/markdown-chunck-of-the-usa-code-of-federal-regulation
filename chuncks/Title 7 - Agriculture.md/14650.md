###### ยง 281.2 Administration.
####### Project area designation.

(c)(1) An Indian reservation shall be designated as a separate project area or areas for the purpose of improving the accessibility of program services to Indians on the reservation unless:

(i) The State agency demonstrates to FNS that the size or population of the reservation does not warrant such designation;

(ii) The State agency demonstrates to FNS that the tribe can be adequately served by the existing or a planned project area because of the location of certification and issuance offices;

(iii) The State agency demonstrates to FNS that such designation would reduce the availability of certification and issuance offices; or

(iv) The State agency otherwise demonstrates to FNS that such designation would impair its Statewide administration of the Program.

(2) In the case where the Indian reservation boundaries cross State lines, the ITO and the appropriate State agencies may jointly request FNS approval that a single State agency administer SNAP on all or part of the Indian reservation. A single agency of the State government would have to administer the Program under the same terms and conditions applied to all other political subdivisions within its jurisdiction. An ITO designated as a State agency pursuant to ยง 281.4(d) would have to administer the Program under the same terms and conditions on all areas of the reservation.
