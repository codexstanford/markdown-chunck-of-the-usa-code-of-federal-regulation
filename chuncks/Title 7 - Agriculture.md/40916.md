(d)When liquidation of a direct loan is approved, the State Director will be asked by the official who approved the liquidation to immediately obtain an assignment of the loan to if the promissory note is not held in the County Office. Pending the assignment, preliminary steps to effect liquidation should be taken, but civil or other court action will not be started and claims will not be filed in bankruptcy or similar proceedings or in probate or administration proceedings with respect to the insured loan claim, unless essential to protect Government's interests and OGC recommends such action. However, other steps need not be held up pending assignment. If any problems are encountered in obtaining the assignment, OGC may be contacted for advice.
