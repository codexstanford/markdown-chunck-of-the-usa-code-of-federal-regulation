###### Load deflection.

(ii)Free standing buried plant housings shall be tested for load deflection in accordance with Figure 6. The assembled housing shall be rigidly held in place by a mechanical means to simulate a normal field installation. A length of wire or cable, or other suitable material, shall be placed around the top section of the housing and deadended. The wire or cable shall be initially tensioned to 23 kg (50 lb). A measurement shall then be taken of the deflection of the housing at the top as shown in Figure 6. The deflection shall be recorded at incremental loads of 23 kg (50 lb) until destruction of the housing occurs. The average load for the three directions shall not be less than 136 kg (300 lb) and the minimum load in any direction shall be 113 kg (250 lb). Failure is defined as housing component fracture or crazing of the housing's surface finish. Figure 6 is as follows:
