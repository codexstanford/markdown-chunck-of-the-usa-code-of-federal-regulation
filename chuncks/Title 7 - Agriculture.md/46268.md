####### ยง 4280.117 Determination of technical merit.
######## General.

(a)The Agency will use the information provided in the applicant's application and/or technical report to determine whether or not the project has technical merit. In making this determination, the Agency may engage the services of other Government agencies or other recognized industry experts in the applicable technology field, at its discretion, to evaluate and rate the technical report. The technical report can also be provided in the technical feasibility section of the feasibility study, when required, instead of completing a separate technical report.
