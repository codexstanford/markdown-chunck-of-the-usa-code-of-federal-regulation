######## Individual Wastewater Disposal Systems,General.

A.-1.a. In this subpart, an individual wastewater disposal system is a sewage disposal system which serves only 1 dwelling unit.

b. When service from an acceptable public or community system is not available or feasible, and ground water and soil conditions are acceptable, an individual system may be used.

c. Each individual wastewater disposal system shall consist of a house sewer, a pretreatment unit (e.g., septic tank, individual package treatment plant), and acceptable absorption system (subsurface absorption field, seepage pit(s), or subsurface absorption bed). The system shall be designed to receive all sanitary sewage (bathrooms, kitchen and laundry) from the dwelling, but not footing or roof drainage. It shall be designed so that gases generated anywhere in the system can easily flow back to the building sewer stack.
