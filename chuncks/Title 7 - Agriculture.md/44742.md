####### Sinkhole Insurance or Mine Subsidence Insurance.

(v)The deductible for sinkhole insurance or mine subsidence insurance should be similar to what would be required for earthquake insurance.

(10) Deductible amounts (excluding flood, windstorm, earthquake and sinkhole insurance, or mine subsidence insurance) must be accounted for in the replacement reserve account, unless the deductible does not exceed the maximum deductible allowable as indicated in paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section. Borrowers who wish to increase the deductible amount must deposit an additional amount to the reserve account equal to the difference between the Agency's maximum deductible and the requested new deductible. The Borrower will be required to maintain this additional amount so long as the higher deductible is in force.
