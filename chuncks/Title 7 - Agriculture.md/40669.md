The terms "nonprogram (NP)" and "ineligible" may be used interchangeably throughout this subpart, but are identical in their meaning. Sales efforts will be initiated as soon as property is acquired in order to effect sale at the earliest practicable time. When a property is of a nature that will enable a qualified applicant for one of the applicable loan programs to meet the objectives of that loan program, preference will be given to the program applicants. Sales are authorized for program purposes which differ from the purposes of the loan the property formerly secured, and property which secured more than one type loan may be sold under the program most appropriate for the specific property and community needs as long as the price is not diminished. Examples are: (RH) property; detached Labor Housing or Rural Rental Housing units may be sold as SFH units; or SFH units may be sold as a Rural Rental Housing project. All such properties and applicants must meet the requirements for the loan program under which the sale is proposed.
