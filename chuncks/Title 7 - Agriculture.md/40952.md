######## Continuation of secured debt and transfer or security.

(g)When a surviving member of a deceased borrower's family or other person is interested in continuing the loan and taking over the security for the benefit of all or a part of the deceased borrower's family who were directly dependent on the borrower for their support at the time of the borrower's death, continuation may be approved subject to the following:

(1) Any individual who is liable for the indebtedness of the deceased borrower may continue with the loan provided that individual can comply with the obligations of the notes or other evidence of debt and chattel or real estate security instruments and so long as liquidation is not necessary to protect the interest of the Agency. When an individual who is liable for the indebtedness is to continue with the account, Form 450-10, "Advice of Borrower's Change of Address or Name," will be sent to the Finance Office to change the account to that individual's name. A new case number will be assigned or, if the continuing individual already has a case number, that number will be used regardless of whether that individual assumed all or a portion of the amount of the debt owed by the estate of the deceased.

(2) When a surviving member of a deceased borrower's family, a relative or other individual who is not liable for the indebtedness desires to continue with the farming or other operations and the loan, the State Director may approve the transfer of chattel or real estate security or both to the individual and the assumption of the debt secured by such property without regard to whether the transferee is eligible for the type of loan being assumed, subject to the following conditions:

(i) The transferee will continue the farming or other operations for the benefit of all or a part of the deceased borrower's family who were directly dependent on the borrower for their support at the time of death.

(ii) The amount to be assumed and the repayment rates and terms will be the same as provided in ยง 1962.34(a) of this Subpart.

(iii) The State Director determines that the continuation will not adversely affect repayment of the loan.

(iv) The transferee has never been liable for a previous Farm Loan Programs direct farm loan or loan guarantee which was reduced or terminated in a manner that resulted in a loss to the Government.

(3) In determining whether to continue with individuals, whether they are already liable or assume the indebtedness, all pertinent factors will be considered including whether:

(i) Probate or administration proceedings have been or will be started and, with OGC's advice, whether the filing of a claim on the debt owed to the Agency in such proceedings is necessary to protect the Agency's interests.

(ii) Arrangements can be made with the heirs, creditors, executors, administrators, and other interested parties to transfer title to the security to the continuing individual and to avoid liquidating the assets so that the individual can continue with the loan on a feasible basis.

(4) If continuation is approved, all reasonable and practical steps, short of foreclosure or other litigation, will be taken to vest title to the security in the joint debtor or transferee.

(5) The deceased borrower's estate may be released from liability for the Agency indebtedness if title to the security is vested in the joint debtor or transferee, and:

(i) The full amount of the debt is assumed, or

(ii) If only a portion of the debt is assumed, the amount assumed equals the amount as determined by OGC which could be collected from the assets of the estate of the deceased borrower, including the value of any security or EO property.
