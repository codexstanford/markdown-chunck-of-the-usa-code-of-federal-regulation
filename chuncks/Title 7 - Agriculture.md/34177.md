####### Deferments for financial hardship.

(a)(1) In cases of financial hardship, a Borrower may request that RUS defer principal or interest or both. RUS will consider whether the deferral will help a Borrower place its operations on a more stable financial basis and thereby provide assurance of repayment of loans within the time when payment of such loans are due under the terms of the note or notes as extended.

(2) RUS will determine whether a Borrower qualifies for the deferment on a case-by-case basis, considering such factors as the following:

(i) Substantial unreimbursed or uninsured expenses relating to storm damage;

(ii) Loss of large power load (as defined in ยง 1710.7(c)(6)(ii) of this chapter, Large retail power contracts); or

(iii) Substantial loss of consumers or load due to hostile annexations and condemnations, without adequate compensation.
