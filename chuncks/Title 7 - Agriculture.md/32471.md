####### Credit memo

means a commercial document, also known as a credit memorandum, issued by the ATP Participant to a commercial entity that owes the ATP Participant a certain sum. A credit memo is used when the ATP Participant owes the commercial entity a sum less than the amount the entity owes the Participant. The credit memo reflects an offset of the amount the ATP Participant owes the entity against the amount the entity owes to the ATP Participant.
