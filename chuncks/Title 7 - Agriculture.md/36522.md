With the test samples suitably supported, conductors from each sample shall be pulled, one at a time, by a tensile machine at a cross-head speed of 6 cm/min (2.4 in./min). Wires shall be pulled both perpendicular and parallel to the plane of the face of the splice module and shall withstand a load of at least 1.1 kg (2.5 lb) before pulling out.
