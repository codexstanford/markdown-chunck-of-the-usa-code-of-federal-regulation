means review of a decision-maker's determination that a decision is not appealable under this part. That decision is, however, subject to review according to ยง 780.5 or 7 CFR part 11 to determine whether the decision involves a factual dispute that is appealable or is, instead, an attempt to challenge generally applicable program policies, provisions, regulations, or statutes that were not appealable.
