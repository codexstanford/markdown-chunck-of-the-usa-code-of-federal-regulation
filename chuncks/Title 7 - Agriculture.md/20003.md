######## Borrower (or debtor)

is an individual or entity that has an outstanding obligation to the Agency or to a lender under any direct or guaranteed FLP loan, without regard to whether the loan has been accelerated. The term "borrower" includes all parties liable for such obligation, including collection-only borrowers, except for debtors whose total loans and accounts have been voluntarily or involuntarily foreclosed, sold, or conveyed, or who have been discharged of all such obligations owed to the Agency or guaranteed lender.
