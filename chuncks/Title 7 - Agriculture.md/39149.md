######## Legal authority and responsibility.

(4)Each applicant must have or will obtain the legal authority necessary for constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed facility or service and for obtaining, giving security for, and repaying the proposed loan. The applicant shall be responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility, and providing for its continued availability and use at reasonable rates and terms. This responsibility shall be exercised by the applicant even though the facility may be operated, maintained, or managed by a third party under contract, management agreement, or written lease. Leases may be used when this is the only feasible way to provide the service and is the customary practice. Management agreements should provide for at least those items listed in guide 24 of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office). Such contracts, management agreements, or leases must not contain options or other provisions for transfer of ownership.
