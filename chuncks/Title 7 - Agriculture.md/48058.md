####### Essential community facility

means a public improvement, operated on a non-profit basis, needed for the orderly development of a rural community where the rural community is a city or town, or its equivalent county or multi-county area. The term "facility" refers to both the physical structure financed, and the resulting service provided to rural residents or rural businesses. Facilities may include, but are not be limited to, courthouses, community centers, libraries, firehouses, health care, education, transportation, and industrial parks. An industrial park consists of land and the necessary access ways and utilities to the site, but not improvements erected on such site.
