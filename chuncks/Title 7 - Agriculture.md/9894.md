######## Monitoring of food service management company procurements.

(l)(1) The State agency shall ensure that sponsors' food service management company procurements are carried out in accordance with §§ 225.15(m) and 225.17.

(2) Each State agency shall develop a standard form of contract for use by sponsors in contracting with food service management companies. Sponsors that are public entities, sponsors with exclusive year-round contracts with a food service management company, and sponsors that have no food service management company contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold in 2 CFR part 200, as applicable, may use their existing or usual form of contract, provided that such form of contract has been submitted to and approved by the State agency. The standard contract developed by the State agency shall expressly and without exception provide that:

(i) All meals prepared by a food service management company shall be unitized, with or without milk or juice, unless the State agency has approved, pursuant to paragraph (l)(3) of this section, a request for exceptions to the unitizing requirement for certain components of a meal;

(ii) A food service management company entering into a contract with a sponsor under the Program shall not subcontract for the total meal, with or without milk, or for the assembly of the meal;

(iii) The sponsor shall provide to the food service management company a list of State agency approved food service sites, along with the approved level for the number of meals which may be claimed for reimbursement for each site, established under § 225.6(h)(2), and shall notify the food service management company of all sites which have been approved, cancelled, or terminated subsequent to the submission of the initial approved site list and of any changes in the approved level of meal service for a site. Such notification shall be provided within the time limits mutually agreed upon in the contract;

(iv) The food service management company shall maintain such records (supported by invoices, receipts, or other evidence) as the sponsor will need to meet its responsibilities under this part, and shall submit all required reports to the sponsor promptly at the end of each month, unless more frequent reports are required by the sponsor;

(v) The food service management company must have State or local health certification for the facility in which it proposes to prepare meals for use in the Program. It must ensure that health and sanitation requirements are met at all times. In addition, the food service management company must ensure that meals are inspected periodically to determine bacteria levels present in the meals and that the bacteria levels found to be present in the meals conform with the standards set by local health authorities. The results of the inspections must be submitted promptly to the sponsor and to the State agency.

(vi) The meals served under the contract shall conform to the cycle menus and meal quality standards and food specifications approved by the State agency and upon which the bid was based;

(vii) The books and records of the food service management company pertaining to the sponsor's food service operation shall be available for inspection and audit by representatives of the State agency, the Department and the U.S. Government Accountability Office at any reasonable time and place for a period of 3 years from the date of receipt of final payment under the contract, except that, if audit or investigation findings have not been resolved, such records shall be retained until all issues raised by the audit or investigation have been resolved;

(viii) The sponsor and the food service management company shall operate in accordance with current Program regulations;

(ix) The food service management company shall be paid by the sponsor for all meals delivered in accordance with the contract and this part. However, neither the Department nor the State agency assumes any liability for payment of differences between the number of meals delivered by the food service management company and the number of meals served by the sponsor that are eligible for reimbursement;

(x) Meals shall be delivered in accordance with a delivery schedule prescribed in the contract;

(xi) Increases and decreases in the number of meals ordered shall be made by the sponsor, as needed, within a prior notice period mutually agreed upon;

(xii) All meals served under the Program shall meet the requirements of § 225.16;

(xiii) In cases of nonperformance or noncompliance on the part of the food service management company, the company shall pay the sponsor for any excess costs which the sponsor may incur by obtaining meals from another source;

(xiv) If the State agency requires the sponsor to establish a special account for the deposit of operating costs payments in accordance with the conditions set forth in § 225.6(j), the contract shall so specify;

(xv) The food service management company shall submit records of all costs incurred in the sponsor's food service operation in sufficient time to allow the sponsor to prepare and submit the claim for reimbursement to meet the 60-day submission deadline; and

(xvi) The food service management company shall comply with the appropriate bonding requirements, as set forth in § 225.15(m)(5) through (7).

(3) All meals prepared by a food service management company shall be unitized, with or without milk or juice, unless the sponsor submits to the State agency a request for exceptions to the unitizing requirement for certain components of a meal. These requests shall be submitted to the State agency in writing in sufficient time for the State agency to respond prior to the sponsor's advertising for bids. The State agency shall notify the sponsor in writing of its determination in a timely manner.

(4) Each State agency shall have a representative present at all food service management company procurement bid openings when sponsors are expected to receive more than $100,000 in Program payments.

(5) Copies of all contracts between sponsors and food service management companies, along with a certification of independent price determination, shall be submitted to the State agency prior to the beginning of Program operations. Sponsors shall also submit to the State agency copies of all bids received and their reason for selecting the food service management company chosen.

(6) All bids in an amount which exceeds the lowest bid shall be submitted to the State agency for approval before acceptance. All bids totaling $100,000 or more shall be submitted to the State agency for approval before acceptance. State agencies shall respond to a request for approval of such bids within 5 working days of receipt.

(7) The contract between a sponsor and food service management company shall be no longer than 1 year; and options for the yearly renewal of a contract may not exceed 4 additional years. All contracts shall include a termination clause whereby either party may cancel for cause or for convenience with up to 60-day notification.

(8) Failure by a sponsor to comply with the provisions of this paragraph or § 225.15(m) shall be sufficient grounds for the State agency to terminate participation by the sponsor in accordance with § 225.18(b).
