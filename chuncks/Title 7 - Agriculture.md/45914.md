####### Introduction.

(a)This section contains regulations for the Business and Industry National COVID-19 Public Health Emergency loan program (B&I CARES Act Program Loans). The purpose of the program is to provide loan guarantees under the authority of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (Pub. L. 116-136). These B&I CARES Act Program Loans cover costs to prevent, prepare for and respond to the coronavirus. Consistent with the purposes of the CARES Act, the Agency has determined that the most effective use of these program funds is to support the cost of guaranteed loans to rural businesses to respond to the coronavirus. No B&I CARES Act Program Loan guarantee will be approved after September 30, 2021. All provisions of Subparts A and B of Part 4279 and Subpart A of Part 4287 of this chapter apply to B&I CARES Act Program Loans, except as provided in this section. All forms used in connection with a B&I CARES Act Program Loan will be those used with other Business and Industry (B&I) loans, except as provided in this section.
