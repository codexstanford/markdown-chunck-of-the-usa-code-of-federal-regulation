######## Guaranteed value.

The maximum amount indicated on the face of the payment guarantee, exclusive of interest, that CCC agrees to pay the holder of the payment guarantee. The guaranteed value is calculated by deducting the initial payment and any discounts and allowances from the net contract value and adding to that result the value of local costs that CCC has approved for coverage. The resulting figure is then multiplied by the guaranteed percentage (up to the maximum percentage allowable for that country).
