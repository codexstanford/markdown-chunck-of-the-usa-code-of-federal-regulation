(2) Except as authorized by paragraph (f) of this section, consignments that continue by air from the port of arrival in the continental United States may be authorized by APHIS for only one additional stop in the continental United States, provided the second stop is within the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and is staffed by APHIS inspectors. As an alternative to transloading a consignment arriving in the United States into another aircraft, consignments that arrive by air may be transloaded into a truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final destination of the consignment through the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of arrival in the United States or at the second authorized air stop within the designated corridor. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (, equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision.
