###### Environmental requirements,Insulation resistance/high humidity and salt fog exposure.

(2)-(i)A test specimen shall consist of a standard ground or pole mounted housing equipped with a full complement of binding post terminals equipped with 25 special service markers. The minimum number of terminals to be tested shall be 100 pair (100 tips and 100 associated rings). The test terminals shall be selected to form a terminal array of approximate square dimensions. A 1 cm (36 in.) length of cross-connect wire shall be installed on each test terminal. All tips shall be joined together and all rings shall be joined together with a 48 volt dc potential applied as shown in Figure 12 during the high humidity/salt fog and simulated rain exposures. The 48 volt dc may be temporarily removed from the test samples during the measurement process and the ring terminal being measured shall be isolated from the remaining ring terminals. The terminal insulation resistance shall be measured at a potential of 100 volts dc using suitable instrumentation with a minimum measurement range of 10to 10ohms. Figure 12 is as follows:
