######## Identification of High Error Project Areas/Counties/Local Offices.

(g)FNS may use quality control information to determine which project areas/counties/local offices have reported payment error rates that are either significantly greater than the State agency average or greater than the national error standard of the Program. When FNS notifies a State agency that a "high error" area exists, the State agency shall ensure that corrective action is developed and reported in accordance with the provisions of ยง 275.17. If FNS identifies a "high error" locality which a State agency has previously identified as error-prone and taken appropriate action, no further State agency shall be required. If a State agency's corrective action plan fails to address problems in FNS-identified "high error" areas, FNS may require a State agency to implement new or modified cost-effective procedures for the certification of households.
