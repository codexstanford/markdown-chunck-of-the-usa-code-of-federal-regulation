(e)Funds may be used to install streets, a water supply, sewage disposal, heating and cooling systems, electric, gas, solar, or other power sources for lighting and other features necessary for the housing. If such facilities are located off-site, loan funds may only be used if the following additional requirements are met:

(1) The loan applicant will hold title to the facility or have a legal right to use the facility in the form of an easement or other instrument acceptable to the Agency for a period of at least 50 percent longer than the term of the loan or grant and the title or right is transferable to any subsequent owner of the housing.

(2) The facilities will either be provided for the exclusive use of the proposed housing project, or Agency funds are limited to the prorated part of the total cost of the facility according to the use and benefit to the MFH project. If entities other than the housing project financed by the Agency use the facilities on a reimbursable fee basis, the loan applicant must agree, in writing, to apply any fees collected in excess of operating expenses to their Agency loan account as an extra loan payment.
