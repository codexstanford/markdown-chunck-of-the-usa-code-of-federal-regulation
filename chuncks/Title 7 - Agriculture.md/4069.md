###### Classification of Leaf Tobacco Covering Classes, Types and Groups of Grades
####### ยง 30.36 Class 1; flue-cured types and groups.

All flue-cured tobacco is graded under the same set of Official Standard Grades for Flue-cured Tobacco (U.S. Types 11, 12, 13, and 14). Flue-cured types are defined according to established general geographical areas of production. However, the determination as to type designations are based upon and indicate the geographic location where inspection and certification are performed-and do not necessarily identify the production area in which the tobacco was grown.
