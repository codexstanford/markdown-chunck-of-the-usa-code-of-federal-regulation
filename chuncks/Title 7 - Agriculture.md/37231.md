###### ยง 1780.87 Permanent instruments for Agency loans.
####### Second preference-single instruments with amortized installments.

(b)A single instrument providing for amortized installments which follows Form RD 440-22 as closely as possible. The full amount of the loan must show on the face of the instrument, and there must be provisions for entering the date and amount of each advance on the reverse or an attachment. When principal payments are deferred, the instrument will show that "interest only" is due on interest-only installment dates, rather than specific dollar amounts. The payment period including the "interest only" installment cannot exceed 40 years, the useful life of the facility, or State statute limitations, whichever occurs first. The amortized installment, computed as follows, will be shown as due on installment dates thereafter.
