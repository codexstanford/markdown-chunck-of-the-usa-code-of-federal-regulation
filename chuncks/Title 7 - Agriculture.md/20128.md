######## Operator

is the individual or entity that provides the labor, management, and capital to operate the farm. The operator can be either an owner-operator or tenant-operator. Under applicable State law, an entity may have to receive authorization from the State in which the farm is located to be the owner and/or operator of the farm. Operating-only entities may be considered owner-operators when the individuals who own the farm real estate own at least 50 percent of the family farm operation.
