(3)Full-time resident inspection is required for all construction unless a written exception is made by Rural Development upon written request of the owner. Unless otherwise agreed, the resident inspector will be provided by the consulting architect/engineer. Prior to the preconstruction conference, the architect/engineer will submit a resume of qualifications of the resident inspector to the owner and to Rural Development for acceptance in writing. If the owner provides the resident inspector, it must submit a resume of the inspector's qualifications to the project architect/engineer and Rural Development for acceptance in writing prior to the preconstruction conference. The resident inspector will work under the general supervision of the project architect/engineer. A guide format for preparing daily inspection reports (Guide 11 of this subpart) and Form RD 1924-18, "Partial Payment Estimate," are available on request from Rural Development.
