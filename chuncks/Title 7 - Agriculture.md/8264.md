######## Meals, Ready-To-Eat (MRE).

Meals, Ready-To-Eat are complete portions of one meal for one military person and are processed and packaged to destroy or retard the growth of spoilage-type microorganisms in order to extend product shelf life for 7 years. Composition analyses for MREs are covered by the reimbursable agreement in the Memorandums of Understanding (MOU's) between AMS, USDA and the Defense Personnel Support Center, Department of Defense (DOD). These DOD, Defense Personnel Support Center (DPSC) contracts state certain military specifications for an acceptable one meal serving, retorted pouched or 18-24 serving hermetically-sealed tray packed meat, or meal product regarding satisfactory analyses for fat, salt, protein, moisture content, added stabilizer ingredient, and sometimes microbiological composition. MREs are for use by the DOD, DPSC as a component of operational food rations, and as an item of general issue by the military.
