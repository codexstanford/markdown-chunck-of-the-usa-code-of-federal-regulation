######## Suballocation by the State Director.

(j)Dependent upon the individual program for which funds are being allocated, the State Director may be directed or given the option of suballocating the State allocation to District or County Offices. When suballocating the State Director may retain a portion of the funds in a State Office reserve to provide flexibility in situations of unexpected or justified need. When performing a suballocation the State Director will use the same formula, criteria and weights as used by the National Office.
