(1) Loans requiring an Environmental Impact Statement;

(2) Loans to finance generation and transmission facilities, when the loan request for such facilities is $25 million or more; and

(3) Loans for the purpose of assisting borrowers to implement demand side management and energy conservation programs and on and off grid renewable energy systems.
