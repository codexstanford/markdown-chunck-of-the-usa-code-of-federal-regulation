####### Power supply arrangements.

(c)(1) Power supply contracts (including but not limited to economy energy sales and emergency power and energy sales), interconnection agreements, interchange agreements, wheeling agreements, pooling agreements, and any other similar power supply arrangements subject to approval by RUS are deemed approved if they have a term of 5 years or less. Amendments to said power supply arrangements are also deemed approved provided that the amendment does not extend the term of the arrangement for more than 5 years beyond the date of the amendment.

(2) Any amendment to a schedule or exhibit contained in any power supply arrangement subject to RUS approval, which merely has the effect of either altering a list of interconnection or delivery points or changing the value of a variable term (but not the formula itself) contained in a formulary rate or charge is deemed approved.

(3) The provisions of this paragraph (c) apply regardless of whether the borrower is a seller or purchaser of the services furnished by the contracts or arrangements, and regardless of whether or not a Federal power marketing agency is a party to any of them.
