####### Precautions.

(j)The following types of provisions in debt instruments should be avoided:

(1) Provisions for the holder to manually post each payment to the instrument.

(2) Provisions for returning the permanent or temporary debt instrument to the borrower in order that it, rather than the Agency, may post the date and amount of each advance or repayment on the instrument.

(3) Provisions that amend covenants contained in RUS Bulletins 1780-27 or 1780-28.

(4) Defeasance provisions in loan or bond resolutions. When a bond issue is defeased, a new issue is sold which supersedes the contractual provisions of the prior issue, including the refinancing requirement and any lien on revenues. Since defeasance in effect precludes the Agency from requiring refinancing before the final maturity date, it represents a violation of the statutory refinancing requirement; therefore, it is disallowed. No loan documents shall include a provision of defeasance.
