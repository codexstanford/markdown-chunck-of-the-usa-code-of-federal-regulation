###### ยง 930.159 Handler diversion.
####### Diversion of finished products.

(d)Handlers may be granted diversion credit for finished tart cherry products that are accidentally destroyed or voluntarily destroyed by the handler. To receive diversion credit under this option the cherry products must be owned by the handler at the time of accidental or voluntary destruction, be a marketable product at the time of processing, be included in the handler's end of the year handler plan, and have been assigned a Raw Product Equivalent (RPE) by the handler to determine the volume of cherries. In addition, the accidental or voluntary destruction and disposition of the product must be verified by either a USDA inspector or Board agent or employee who witnesses the disposition of the accidentally or voluntarily destroyed product. Products will be considered as accidentally destroyed if they sustain damage which renders them unacceptable in normal market channels. Products which are voluntarily destroyed must have deteriorated in condition to such an extent that they are not acceptable for use in normal market channels.
