(a)Cleaning tools are objects that are used to clean a variety of surfaces or items and can be used multiple times.

The expendable materials used in cleaning, such as glass cleaners, single-use wipes, and all-purpose cleaners, are excluded from this category, as these materials better fit in other categories.
