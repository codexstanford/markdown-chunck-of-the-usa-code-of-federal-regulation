####### Lender's responsibilities.

(a)It is the lender's responsibility to protect the guaranteed loan and all of the collateral securing it in bankruptcy proceedings, including taking actions that result in greater recoveries and not taking actions that would not likely be cost-effective. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Monitoring confirmed bankruptcy plans to determine borrower compliance, and, if the borrower fails to comply, seeking a dismissal of the bankruptcy plan;

(2) Filing a proof of claim, where necessary, and all the necessary papers and pleadings concerning the case;

(3) Attending and, where necessary, participating in meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings;

(4) Requesting modifications of any bankruptcy plan whenever it appears that additional recoveries are likely; and

(5) Keeping the Agency adequately and regularly informed in writing of all aspects of the proceedings.

(6) The lender must submit a default status report when the borrower defaults and every 30 days until the default is resolved or a final loss claim is paid by the Agency. The default status report will be used to inform the Agency of the bankruptcy filing, the plan confirmation date, when the plan is complete, and when the borrower is not in compliance with the plan.

(7) With written Agency consent, the lender and Agency will equally share the cost of any independent appraisal fee to protect the guaranteed loan in any bankruptcy proceedings.
