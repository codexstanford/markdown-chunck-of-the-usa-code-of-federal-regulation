####### ยง 4280.122 Selecting RES and EEI grant applications for award.
######## Funding selected applications.

(d)As applications are funded, if insufficient funds remain to fund the next highest scoring application, the Agency may elect to fund a lower scoring application. Before this occurs, the Agency will provide the applicant of the higher scoring application the opportunity to reduce the amount of the applicant's grant request to the amount of funds available. If the applicant agrees to lower its grant request, the applicant must certify that the purposes of the project will be met and provide the remaining total funds needed to complete the project. If two or more applications score the same and if remaining funds are insufficient to fund each such application, the Agency will notify the applicants that they may either accept a proportional amount of funds or submit their total request for the next available competition. At its discretion, the Agency may also elect to allow any remaining multi-year funds to be carried over to the next fiscal year rather than selecting a lower scoring application.
