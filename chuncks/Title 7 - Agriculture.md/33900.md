####### Power supply borrowers.

(c)(1) Power supply borrowers not exempt from RUS investment controls under ยง 1717.656(a) may request approval to exceed the 15 percent level if all of the following criteria are met:

(i) Satisfactory evidence has been provided that the borrower is in compliance with all provisions of its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS;

(ii) The borrower is not in financial workout and has not had its government debt restructured;

(iii) The borrower has equity equal to at least 5 percent of its total assets; and

(iv) After approval of the investment, loan or guarantee, the aggregate of the borrower's investments, loans and guarantees will not exceed 20 percent of the borrower's total utility plant.

(2) Borrower requests for approval to exceed the 15 percent level will be considered on a case by case basis. The requests must be made in writing.

(3) In considering borrower requests, the Administrator will take the following factors into consideration:

(i) The repayment of all loans secured under the RUS mortgage will continue to be assured, and loan security must continue to be reasonably adequate, even if the entire investment or loan is lost or the borrower is required to perform for the entire amount of the guarantee. These risks will be considered along with all other risks facing the borrower, whether or not related to the investment, loan or guarantee;

(ii) In the case of investments, the investment must be made in an entity separate from the borrower, such as a subsidiary, whereby the borrower is protected from any liabilities incurred by the separate entity, unless the borrower demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that making the investment directly rather than through a separate entity will present no substantial risk to the borrower in addition to the possibility of losing all or part of the original investment;

(iii) The borrower must be economically and financially sound as indicated by its costs of operation, competitiveness, operating TIER and operating DSC, physical condition of the plant, ratio of equity to total assets, ratio of net utility plant to long-term debt, and other factors; and

(iv) Other factors affecting the security and repayment of government debt, as determined by the Administrator on a case by case basis.

(4) If the Administrator approves an investment, loan or guarantee, such investment, loan or guarantee will continue to be included when calculating the borrower's ratio of aggregate investments, loans and guarantees to total utility plant.
