####### Predetermined fixed rates for indirect costs.

(a)A predetermined fixed rate for computing indirect costs applicable to program administration may be negotiated annually in situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties to reach an informed judgment (1) as to the probable level of indirect costs in the State agency during the period to be covered by the negotiated rate, and (2) that the amount allowable under the predetermined rate would not exceed actual indirect costs.
