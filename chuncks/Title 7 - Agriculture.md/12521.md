####### Formula

(h)means the formula used by the Department to allocate among States the commodities and funding available under this part. The amount of such commodities and funds to be provided to each State will be based on each State's population of low-income and unemployed persons, as compared to national statistics. Each State's share of commodities and funds shall be based 60 percent on the number of persons in households within the State having incomes below the poverty level and 40 percent on the number of unemployed persons within the State. The surplus commodities will be allocated to States on the basis of their weight (pounds), and the commodities purchased under section 214 of the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 will be allocated on the basis of their value (dollars). In instances in which a State determines that it will not accept the full amount of its allocation of commodities purchased under section 214 of the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, the Department will reallocate the commodities to other States on the basis of the same formula used for the initial allocation.
