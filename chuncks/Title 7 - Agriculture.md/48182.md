####### Service area.

(d)(1) The project must be installed to serve any user within the Service Area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served.

(2) The lender must determine that, when feasible and legally possible, inequities within the project's service area for the same type service proposed will be remedied by the borrower on, or before, completion of the project. Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability, adequacy, or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems or facilities that were developed under different financing, rates, terms, or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.
