####### ยง 993.150 Disposition of prunes by handlers.
######## Outgoing inspection.

(b)Except as otherwise specifically provided, no handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of natural condition prunes or of processed prunes unless he has, prior to such shipment or final disposition, had them inspected and obtained a certificate showing that such prunes meet the effective minimum standards. Such inspection shall be made during that portion of the final preparation of the prunes for shipment or other final disposition as will permit proper sampling, whether in-line or floor inspection, and no handler shall perform such final preparation unless an inspector is present. The handler shall furnish promptly to the inspector a copy of the shipping or disposition order or other documents, which shall show the date of each shipment or disposition, the applicable reference number thereof, and an adequate description of the shipment or disposition. For the prunes inspected each day which meet the applicable minimum grade and size requirements for standard prunes, or standard processed prunes, the handler shall cause the inspector to issue in triplicate a signed certificate containing the following information:

(1) The date and place of inspection;

(2) The name and address of the handler and of the inspection service;

(3) The number and size of packages or the net weight of prunes;

(4) The number of the worksheet or worksheets on which the inspector's computations and results of tests are recorded; and

(5) A statement that the prunes meet the effective minimum standards for standard prunes, or standard processed prunes, as the case may be.
