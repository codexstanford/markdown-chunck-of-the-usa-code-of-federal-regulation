###### Functional design criteria for binding post terminal blocks used in SAI cabinets,General description.

(f)-(1)A conventional binding post terminal consists of a metallic element or post, one end of which is configured for the permanent connection of 22, 24, or 26 AWG solid copper conductors and the opposite end is configured for recurring connections and disconnections of solid copper cross-connect wire using a threaded screw or stud and nut combination for gripping the wire. The terminal is usually housed in a SAI cabinet. However, the terminal may receive limited use in smaller pedestal-type housings and pole mounted cabinets in the outside plant environment.
