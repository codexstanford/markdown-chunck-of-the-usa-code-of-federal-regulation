###### Functional design criteria for insulation displacement type cross-connect modules used in SAI cabinets,General

(h)-(1)description. Cross-connect modules normally consist of multiple metallic contact elements that are retained by nonmetallic fixtures. The contact elements are spliced with permanent wire leads compatible for splicing to 22, 24, or 26 gauge cable on one side and configured for the acceptance of recurring connections and disconnections of plastic insulated cross-connect wire on the other side. Cross-connect modules are usually housed in a SAI cabinet. However, modules may receive limited usage in smaller pedestal-type housings and cabinets in the outside plant environment.
