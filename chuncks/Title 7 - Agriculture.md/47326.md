####### Borrower Financial reports.

(e)The Lender must obtain, analyze, and forward to the Agency the Borrower's and any guarantor's financial statements required by the Loan Agreement within 45 days of the end of each Calendar Quarter and audited financial statements within 180 days of the end of the Borrower's fiscal year. The Lender must analyze these financial statements and provide the Agency with a written summary of the Lender's analysis, ratio analysis, and conclusions, which, at a minimum, must include trends, strengths, weaknesses, extraordinary transactions, violations of loan covenants and covenant waivers proposed by the Lender, any routine servicing actions performed, and other indications of the financial condition of the Borrower. Spreadsheets of the financial statements must also be included. Following the Agency's review of the Lender's financial analysis, the Agency will provide a written report of any concerns to the Lender. Any concerns based upon the Agency's review must be addressed by the Lender. If the Lender makes a reasonable attempt to obtain financial statements, but is unable to obtain the Borrower's cooperation, the failure to obtain financial statements will not impair the validity of the Loan Note Guarantee.
