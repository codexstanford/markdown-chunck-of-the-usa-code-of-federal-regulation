###### ยง 1721.106 Repayment of deferred payments.
####### Deferments relating to the ERC loan program, renewable energy project(s), distributed generation project(s), and the contribution(s)-in-aid of construction.

(b)An extension agreement is for a term of two (2) years. The installment will be recalculated each time the Borrower defers the payment of principal and recognition of the deferred amount will begin with the next payment. For example: the amount deferred in the October payment will be reamortized over a 84 month period starting with the next payment (November if paying on a monthly basis). When a Borrower defers principal under any of these programs the scheduled payment on the account will increase by an amount sufficient to pay off the deferred amount, with interest, by the date specified in the agreement (usually 84 months (28 quarters)).
