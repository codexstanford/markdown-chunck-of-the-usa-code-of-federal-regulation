(a)There shall be an ample supply of both hot and cold water of safe and sanitary quality, with adequate facilities for its proper distribution throughout the plant, and protected against contamination. Water from other facilities, when officially approved, may be used for boiler feed water and condenser water provided that such water lines are completely separated from the water lines carrying the sanitary water supply, and the equipment is so constructed and controlled as to preclude contamination of product contact surfaces. There shall be no cross connection between potable water lines and non-potable water lines or between public and private water supplies. Bacteriological examinations shall be made of the plant's sanitary water supply taken at the plant at least twice a year, or as often as necessary to determine safety and suitability as related to product keeping quality for use in manufactured products shall be made by a USDA or State agency laboratory except for supplies that are regularly tested for purity and bacteriological quality, and approved by the local health officer. The results of all water tests shall be kept on file at the plant for which the test was performed.
