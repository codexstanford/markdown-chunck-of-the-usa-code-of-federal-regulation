######### Charges.

(a)The charges for the grading of poultry and rabbits and edible products thereof must be paid by the applicant for the service and will include items listed in this section as are applicable. Payment for the full cost of the grading service rendered to the applicant shall be made by the applicant to the National Finance Center. Such full costs shall comprise such of the items listed in this section as are due and included in the bill or bills covering the period or periods during which the grading service was rendered. Bills are payable upon receipt.

(1) When a signed application for service has been received, the State supervisor or his designee will complete a plant survey pursuant to § 70.34. The costs for completing the plant survey will be borne by the applicant on an unscheduled basis as described in § 70.71. No charges will be assessed when the application is required because of a change in name or ownership. If service is not installed within 6 months from the date the application is filed, or if service is inactive due to an approved request for removal of a grader or graders for a period of 6 months, the application will be considered terminated. A new application may be filed at any time. In addition, there will be a charge of $300 if the application is terminated at the request of the applicant for reasons other than for a change in location within 12 months from the date of the inauguration of service.

(2) Charges for the cost of each grader assigned to a plant will be calculated as described in § 70.71. Minimum fees for service performed under a scheduled agreement will be based on the hours of the regular tour of duty. The Agency reserves the right to use any grader assigned to the plant under a scheduled agreement to perform service for other applicants and no charge will be assessed to the scheduled applicant for the number of hours charged to the other applicant. Charges to plants are as follows:

(i) The regular hourly rate will be charged for hours worked in accordance with the approved tour of duty on the application for service between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.

(ii) The overtime rate will be charged for hours worked in excess of the approved tour of duty on the application for service.

(iii) The holiday hourly rate will be charged for hours worked on observed legal holidays.

(iv) The night differential rate (for regular or overtime hours) will be charged for hours worked between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.

(v) The Sunday differential rate (for regular or overtime hours) will be charged for hours worked on a Sunday.

(vi) For all hours of work performed in a plant without an approved tour of duty, the charge will be one of the applicable hourly rates in § 70.71 plus actual travel expenses incurred by AMS.

(3) A charge at the hourly rates specified in § 70.71, plus actual travel expenses incurred by AMS for intermediate surveys to firms without grading service in effect.
