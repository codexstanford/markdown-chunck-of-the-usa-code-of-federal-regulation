######## Beginning farmer or rancher

means a person, Indian Tribe, Tribal corporation, or legal entity who:

(1) Has not operated a farm, ranch, or non-industrialized private forest land (NIPF), or who has operated a farm, ranch, or NIPF for not more than 10 consecutive years. This requirement applies to all members of an entity who will materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF.

(2) In the case of an individual, individually, or with the immediate family, material and substantial participation requires that the individual provide substantial day-to-day labor and management of the farm, ranch, or NIPF consistent with the practices in the county or State where the farm is located.

(3) In the case of a legal entity or joint operation, all members must materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF . Material and substantial participation requires that each of the members provide some amount of the management or labor and management necessary for day-to-day activities, such that if each of the members did not provide these inputs, operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF would be seriously impaired.
