###### ยง 1780.48 Regional commission grants.

Grants are sometimes made by regional commissions for projects eligible for RUS assistance. RUS has agreed to administer such funds in a manner similar to administering RUS assistance.

(a) When RUS has funds in the project, no charge will be made for administering regional commission funds.

(b) When RUS has no loan or grant funds in the project, an administrative charge will be made pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.C.S. 1535). A fee of 5 percent of the first $100,000 of a regional commission grant and 1 percent of any amount over $100,000 will be paid to RUS by the commission.
