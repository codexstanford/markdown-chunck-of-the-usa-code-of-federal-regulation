####### Occupancy policies.

(e)Borrowers must establish occupancy policies for each housing project. Households living in a rental unit with more bedrooms than persons in the household will be considered over housed and must be relocated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Households under housed as defined by the project's occupancy standards must be relocated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Borrowers with no one-bedroom units in a housing project may make an exception to this requirement in their occupancy policies. In addition, a borrower's occupancy policies must establish:

(1) Reasonable standards for determining when a tenant household is considered under housed. The standards will describe the maximum number of persons that may occupy units of a given size based on occupancy guidelines provided by the Agency or another governmental source;

(2) The order in which eligible applicants and existing tenants will be housed or re-housed; and

(3) How fair housing requirements will be met, including how reasonable accommodations will be made for applicants and tenants with disabilities.
