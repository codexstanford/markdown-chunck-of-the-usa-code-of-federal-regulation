######## Licensing/approval for adult day care centers.

(e)This paragraph prescribes State agency responsibilities to ensure that adult day care centers meet the licensing/approval criteria set forth in this part. Sponsoring organizations shall submit to the State agency documentation that facilities under their jurisdiction are in compliance with licensing/approval requirements. Independent adult day care centers shall submit such documentation to the State agency on their own behalf. Each State agency shall establish procedures to annually review information submitted by institutions to ensure that all participating adult day care centers either:

(1) Are licensed or approved by Federal, State or local authorities, provided that institutions which are approved for Federal programs on the basis of State or local licensing shall not be eligible for the Program if their licenses lapse or are terminated; or

(2) Are complying with applicable procedures to renew licensing or approval in situations where the State agency has no information that licensing or approval will be denied.
