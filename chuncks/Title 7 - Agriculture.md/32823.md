######## Letter of interest.

(a)Prior to submitting an initial application for a payment guarantee in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the seller may, solely at the seller's option, submit a letter of interest to CCC describing a transaction for which FGP coverage may be sought. The letter of interest must contain all of the information specified on the USDA Web site and must be accompanied by a completed preliminary environmental and social screening document. A letter of interest fee, which will be specified on the USDA Web site, must accompany the letter of interest. CCC will review the letter of interest and provide preliminary feedback to the seller on whether the transaction may be eligible for coverage under the FGP. However, CCC's determination whether to issue a payment guarantee will be based on the seller's applications submitted pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.
