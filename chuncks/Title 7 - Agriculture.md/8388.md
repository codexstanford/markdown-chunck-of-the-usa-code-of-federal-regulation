####### ยง 160.19 Samples of rosin for grading.

Samples of rosin for grading shall be approximately cubical in shape, and shall be seven-eighths inch thick in the direction through which they are viewed or graded. Samples may be taken by any of the following methods:

(a) By cutting or cleaving the same from a lump of the rosin removed from the solid mass in the barrel or drum, the top side of which lump shall come from not less than 4 inches below the surface of the rosin.

(b) By placing a tin mold of suitable design inside the barrel or drum through an opening in the side, the center of which opening is approximately 9 inches from the top or 12 inches from the bottom so that when the container is filled, the rosin within the mold will have come from a position not less than 4 inches below the surface of the rosin. The mold thus placed must be entirely within the barrel or drum and completely encased in the rosin.

(c) By suspending in the barrel or drum of molten rosin a clean tinplate mold,inch square (inside) and 1inches or more in length, in such a manner that it will be in a horizontal position at least 2 inches below the surface of the rosin after it has thoroughly cooled. Such sample shall not be spiked from the barrel or drum until it is completely cooled.
