For any calendar year, the term includes only those that imported an average of 1,000 metric tons of lamb meat products per year during the immediately preceding 4 calendar years. Additionally, the term includes those that did not import an average 1,000 metric tons of lamb meat products during the immediately preceding 4 calendar years, if the Secretary determines that the person should be considered an importer based on their volume of lamb imports.
