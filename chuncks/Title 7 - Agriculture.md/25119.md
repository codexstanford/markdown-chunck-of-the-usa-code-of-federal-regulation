####### Disposition obligation.

(4)(i) Beginning August 1, 2016, the weight of inedible kernels in excess of 2 percent of kernel weight reported to the Board of any variety received by a handler shall constitute that handler's disposition obligation. For any almonds sold inshell, the weight may be reported to the Board and the disposition obligation for that variety reduced proportionately.

(ii) If a sufficient sample is not available for any lot of almonds, the handler may establish and substantiate, to the satisfaction of the Board, the received weight, the edible and inedible kernel weights, and the adjusted kernel weight by providing sufficient information as the Board may prescribe. If the handler is only able to establish and substantiate the approximate received weight, an inedible disposition obligation of 10 percent of such received weight may be applied, upon agreement between the Board and the handler.
