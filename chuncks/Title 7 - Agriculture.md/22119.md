######## Summary suspension.

(ii)The Service may, without first affording the organization an opportunity for a hearing, suspend an approval or refuse to reinstate an approval when the suspension period has expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the approval and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official weighing system. A suspension or refusal to reinstate a suspended approval shall be effective when the organization receives a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service shall give the organization an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate its action if it finds that alternative managerial, staffing, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the organization.
