(e)Support services, including the operating and administrative expenses described in section 1944.115(a), are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. These actions, however, are not excluded from individual compliance requirements of other environmental statutes, Executive Orders, and agency regulations where appropriate. When the responsible official determines that any action under this subpart may have an environmental effect because of extraordinary circumstances, the requirements of NEPA shall apply.
