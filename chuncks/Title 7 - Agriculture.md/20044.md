######## Economic Emergency loan

is a loan that was made or guaranteed to an eligible applicant to allow for continuation of the operation during an economic emergency which was caused by a lack of agricultural credit or an unfavorable relationship between production costs and prices received for agricultural commodities. EE loans are not currently funded; however, such outstanding loans are serviced by the Agency or the lender in the case of a guaranteed EE loan.
