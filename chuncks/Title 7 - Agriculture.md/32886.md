######## Misstatements or noncompliance by seller may lead to rescission of payment guarantee.

(d)CCC may cancel a payment guarantee in the event that a seller makes a willful misstatement in the certifications in §§ 1493.270(a) and 1493.330(c) or if the seller fails to comply with the provisions of § 1493.340 or § 1493.385(a). However, notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC will not cancel its payment guarantee if it determines, in its sole discretion, that an assignee had no knowledge of the seller's misstatement or noncompliance at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee.
