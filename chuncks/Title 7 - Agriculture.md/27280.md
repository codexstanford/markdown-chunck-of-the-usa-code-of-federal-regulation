###### Payments for Milk
####### ยง 1131.73 Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.
######## Final payment to a cooperative association for bulk milk received directly from producers' farms.

(4)For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to ยง 1131.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce pro rata his payments pursuant to such paragraphs, but by not more than the amount of such underpayment. Payments to producers shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

(d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund. In the event the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or the lawful claimant, as the case may be.

(e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each pool plant operator shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association described in ยง 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in such form that it may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

(1) The month, and identity of the producer;

(2) The daily and total pounds and the total pounds of butterfat content of producer milk;

(3) The minimum rate at which payment to the producer is required pursuant to the order in this part;

(4) The rate used in making payments if the rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;

(5) The amount, rate per hundredweight, and nature of each deduction claimed by the handler; and

(6) The net amount of payment to the producer or cooperative association.
