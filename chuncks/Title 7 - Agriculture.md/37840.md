######## Construction specifications and use conditions.

(vi)If the insurance policy contains clauses which specify certain standards of construction or prescribes certain uses of the property for the insurance to be valid, the policy is acceptable only if the property meets such specifications or conditions at the time of acceptance. For example, if the policy provides that the chimney be constructed of a certain type of material, the County Supervisor should be assured that the required material has been used, or if the policy provides that farming operations are not carried out on the premises he should be assured that this condition is met.

(2) Policies generally will not be accepted if, under the terms of the policies or local laws, contributions or assessments may be made against the Agency. However, policies which impose assessments on the borrower may be accepted only if the Agency mortgage will be recorded prior to any failure of the borrower to pay any such assessments. Policies also will not be accepted if, by their terms or other conditions, loss payments are contingent upon collective action by the Board of Directors, or the stockholders, or the members.
