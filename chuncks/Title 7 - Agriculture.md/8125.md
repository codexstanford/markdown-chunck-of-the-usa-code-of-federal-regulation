######## Egg product.

Any dried, frozen, or liquid eggs, with or without added ingredients. However, products which contain eggs only in a relatively small proportion or historically have not been, in the judgment of the Secretary, considered by consumers as products of the egg food industry may be exempted by the Secretary under such conditions as may be prescribed to assure that the egg ingredients are not adulterated and such products are not represented as egg products. Some of the products exempted as not being egg products are specified by the AMS Poultry Programs in 7 CFR 57.5.
