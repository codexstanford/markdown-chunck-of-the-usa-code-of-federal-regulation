(h)(1) Interest on advances made on loans made under this section will be at the interest rate available on the date of the advance for the new loan used to refinance the prior outstanding loan and any related premium, fee, or expense.

(2) An eligible entity must propose a maturity date for the new loan not to exceed the maturity prescribed by this section, a funding notice, or thirty-five (35) years, whichever is shortest.

(3) An eligible entity may be given the option of applying the proceeds of an advance made on the new loan to cover any applicable prepayment premium, fee, or other expense.

(4) If the prepayment premiums are to be financed by the new loan, the maximum principal amount of the note will be increased in an amount sufficient to cover such prepayment premiums in full.

(5) Provided such waiver is not inconsistent with applicable law or the terms and conditions of the notes previously issued to RUS or FFB, the Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive or modify the requirements set forth in this paragraph (h), if in the Administrator's judgment, it is necessary to implement the intent of the authorizing statute and is in the best financial interest of the Government.
