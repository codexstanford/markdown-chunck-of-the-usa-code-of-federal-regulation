######## Reserve coverage for loading tolerances.,i.e.

(e)The exporter may apply for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid (, lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.
