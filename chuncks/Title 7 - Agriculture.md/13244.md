######## Jointly processed cases.

(3)If a State agency has a procedure that allows applicants to apply for SNAP and another program at the same time, the State agency shall notify applicants that they may file a joint application for more than one program or they may file a separate application for SNAP benefits independent of their application for benefits from any other program. All SNAP applications, regardless of whether they are joint applications or separate applications, must be processed for SNAP purposes in accordance with SNAP procedural, timeliness, notice, and fair hearing requirements. No household shall have its SNAP benefits denied solely on the basis that its application to participate in another program has been denied or its benefits under another program have been terminated without a separate determination by the State agency that the household failed to satisfy a SNAP eligibility requirement. Households that file a joint application for SNAP benefits and another program and are denied benefits for the other program shall not be required to resubmit the joint application or to file another application for SNAP benefits but shall have its SNAP eligibility determined based on the joint application in accordance with the SNAP processing time frames from the date the joint application was initially accepted by the State agency.
