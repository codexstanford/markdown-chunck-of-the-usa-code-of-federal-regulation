####### Notification of selection.

(c)When the initial selection or subsequent change of an auditor has been made, the auditee must notify the AA-PARA, in writing, at least 90 days prior to the audit date.

(1) Within 30 days of the date of receipt of such notice, RUS will notify the auditee, in writing, if the selection or change in auditor is not satisfactory.

(2) Notification to RUS that the same auditor has been selected for succeeding audits of the auditee's financial statements is not required; however, the procedures outlined in this part must be followed for each new auditor selected, even though such auditor may previously have been approved by RUS to audit records of other RUS auditees. Changes in the name of an auditor are considered to be a change in the auditor.
