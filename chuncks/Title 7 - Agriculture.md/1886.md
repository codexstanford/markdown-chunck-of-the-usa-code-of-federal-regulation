#### Subpart A - General Provisions
##### § 12.6 Administration.
###### Administration by NRCS.

(c)(1) The provisions of this part that are applicable to NRCS shall be administered under the general supervision of the Associate Chief for Conservation, and shall be carried out in the field by the regional conservationist, state conservationist, area conservationist, and district conservationist or other NRCS representative.

(2) An NRCS representative shall make the following determinations which are required to be made in accordance with this part:

(i) Whether land is highly erodible or has a wetland type or a converted wetland identified in accordance with the provisions of this part;

(ii) Whether highly erodible land is predominant on a particular field under § 12.22;

(iii) Whether the conservation plan that a person is applying is based on the local NRCS field office technical guide and is approved by-

(A) The CD and NRCS, or

(B) NRCS;

(iv) Whether the conservation system that a person is using has been approved by the CD under § 12.5(a)(2) or, in an area not within a CD, a conservation system approved by NRCS to be adequate for the production of an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land;

(v) Whether the actions of a person(s) with respect to the conversion of a wetland or production of an agricultural commodity on converted wetland would have only a minimal effect on the functions and values of wetlands in the area;

(vi) Whether an approved conservation plan is being applied on highly erodible fields in accordance with the schedule specified therein or whether a failure to apply the plan is technical and minor in nature, due to circumstances beyond the control of the person, or whether a temporary variance form the requirements of the plan should be granted;

(vii) Whether an approved conservation system is being used on a highly erodible field;

(viii) Whether the conversion of a wetland is for the purpose or has the effect of making the production of an agricultural commodity possible;

(ix) Whether a farmed wetland or farmed-wetland pasture is abandoned;

(x) Whether the planting of an agricultural commodity on a wetland is possible under natural conditions;

(xi) Whether maintenance of existing drainage of a wetland described in § 12.33 exceeds the scope and effect of the original drainage;

(xii) Whether a plan for the mitigation of a converted wetland will be approved and whether the mitigation of a converted wetland is accomplished according to the approved mitigation plan;

(xiii) Whether all technical information relating to the determination of a violation and severity of a violation has been provided to FSA for making payment-reduction determinations; and

(xiv) Whether or not a commenced-conversion activity was completed by January 1, 1995.

(3) NRCS may provide such other technical assistance for implementation of the provisions of this part as is determined to be necessary.

(4) A person may obtain a highly erodible land or a wetland scope-and-effect determination by making a written request on Form AD-1026. The determination will be made in writing, and a copy will be provided to the person.

(5) A determination of whether or not an area meets the highly erodible land criteria or whether wetland criteria, identified in accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation methodology in use at the time of the determination and that are consistent with current mapping conventions, may be made by the NRCS representative based upon existing records or other information and without the need for an on-site determination. This determination will be made by the NRCS representative as soon as possible following a request for such a determination.

(6) An on-site determination as to whether an area meets the applicable criteria shall be made by an NRCS representative if the person has disagreed with the determination made under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, or if adequate information is not otherwise available to an NRCS representative on which to make an off-site determination.

(7) An on-site determination, where applicable, will be made by the NRCS representative as soon as possible following a request for such a determination, but only when site conditions are favorable for the evaluation of soils, hydrology, or vegetation.

(8) With regard to wetland determinations, if an area is continuously inundated or saturated for long periods of time during the growing season to such an extent that access by foot to make a determination of predominance of hydric soils or prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation is not feasible, the area will be determined to be a wetland.

(9) Persons who are adversely affected by a determination made under this section and believe that the requirements of this part were improperly applied may appeal, under § 12.12 of this part, any determination by NRCS.

(10) NRCS will operate a program or work with third parties to establish mitigation banks to assist persons in complying with §§ 12.4(c) and 12.5(b)(4). Persons will be able to access mitigation banks established or approved through this program without requiring the Secretary to hold an easement in a mitigation bank.
