######## Certain contractual events are ineligible for payment guarantee coverage.

(h)The following contractual events are ineligible for coverage under an FGP payment guarantee, except where it is determined by the Director to be in the best interest of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such contractual events:

(1) Contractual events with a date of performance prior to the date of receipt by CCC of the seller's written initial application for a payment guarantee;

(2) Contractual events with a date of performance later than the final date of performance shown on the payment guarantee or any amendments thereof;

(3) Contractual events where the date of issuance of a foreign financial institution letter of credit is later than the date of performance; or

(4) Contractual events that have been guaranteed by CCC under another payment guarantee. If CCC determines that the contractual event has been guaranteed under multiple payment guarantees (or coverage has been requested under multiple payment guarantees), CCC will determine which payment guarantee (or application for payment guarantee), if any, corresponds to an eligible export sale.
