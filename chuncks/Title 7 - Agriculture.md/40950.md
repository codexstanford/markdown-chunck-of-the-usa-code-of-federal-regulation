######## Withdrawal of claim.

(e)It may not be necessary to withdraw a claim when it is paid in full by someone other than the estate or when compromised. However, when it is necessary to permit closing of an estate, compromise of a claim, or for other justifiable reasons, the State Director will recommend to OGC that the claim be withdrawn on receipt of cash or security, or both, of a value at least equal to the amount that could be recovered under the claim against the estate. When the Agency keeps existing security, arrangements must be made to assure that withdrawal of the claim will not affect the Agency's rights under the existing notes or security instruments with respect to the retained security. In some cases, with OGC's advice, the claim may be properly handled without filing a formal petition for withdrawal of the claim. However, if the claim has been referred to the U.S. Attorney, or if a formal withdrawal of the claim is necessary, the matter will be referred by OGC to the U.S. Attorney.
