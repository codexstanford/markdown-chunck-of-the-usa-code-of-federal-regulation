##### ยง 1755.403 Copper cable telecommunications plant measurements.
###### Shield or shield/armor continuity.

(a)(1) Tests and measurements shall be made to ensure that cable shields or shield/armors are electrically continuous. There are two areas of concern. The first is shield or shield/armor bonding within a pedestal or splice and the second is shield or shield/armor continuity between pedestals or splices.

(2) Measurement techniques outlined here for verification of shield or shield/armor continuity are applicable to buried cable plant. Measurements of shield continuity between splices in aerial cable plant should be made prior to completion of splicing. Conclusive results cannot be obtained on aerial plant after all bonds have been completed to the supporting strand, multigrounded neutral, etc.
