####### Matching Funds

-Cash or confirmed funding commitments from non-Federal sources unless otherwise provided by law. Unless otherwise provided, in-kind contributions that conform to the provisions of 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA in 2 CFR part 400 can be used as matching funds. Examples of in-kind contributions include volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, donated supplies and equipment, and donated office space. Matching funds must be provided in advance of grant funding, such that for every dollar of grant that is advanced, not less than the pro-rata portion of matching funds shall have been expended prior to submitting the request for reimbursement. Matching funds are subject to the same use restrictions as grant funds.
