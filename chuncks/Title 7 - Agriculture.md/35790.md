##### ยง 1755.406 Shield or armor ground resistance measurements.
###### Test equipment.

(c)(1) The shield or armor ground resistance measurements may be made using an insulation resistance test set, a dc bridge type megohmmeter, or a commercially available fault locator.

(2) The insulation resistance test set should have an output voltage not to exceed 500 volts dc and may be hand cranked or battery operated.

(3) The dc bridge type megohmmeter, which may be ac powered, should have scales and multipliers which make it possible to accurately read resistance values of 50,000 ohms to 10 megohms. The voltage that is applied to the shield or armor during the test should not be less than "250 volts dc" nor greater than "1,000 volts dc" when using an instrument having adjustable test voltage levels.

(4) Commercially available fault locators may be used in lieu of the above equipment, if the devices are capable of detecting faults having resistance values of 50,000 ohms to 10 megohms. Operation of the devices and method of locating the faults should be in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
