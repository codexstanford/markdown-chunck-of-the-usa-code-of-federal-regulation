####### Submitting plans for approval.

(5)

(a) Responsibility for approving cost allocation plans for individual State agencies has been assigned by the Office of Management and Budget to the cognizant Federal agency.

(b) State cost allocation plans must be submitted to the cognizant Federal agency within six months after the last day of the State's fiscal year. Upon request by the State agency, an extension of time for submittal of the cost allocation plan may be granted by the cognizant Federal agency. It is essential that cost allocation plans be submitted in a timely manner. Failure to submit the plans when required will cause the State agency to become delinquent. In the event a State becomes delinquent, FNS will not provide for the recovery of central service and indirect costs, and such costs already made and claimed against SNAP funds will be subject to disallowance.
