####### Mineral leases.

(a)A lender may consent to the lease of mineral rights and subordinate its lien to the lessee's rights and interests in the mineral activity if the security property will remain suitable as a residence, the lender's security interest will not be adversely affected, and Rural Development's environmental requirements are met. Concurrence by Rural Development prior to consenting to the lease of mineral rights is required, unless otherwise provided by the Agency. Subordination of guaranteed loans to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds from the sale of the security property.

(1) If the proposed activity is likely to decrease the value of the security property, the lender may consent to the lease only if the borrower assigns 100 percent of the income from the lease to the lender to be applied to reduce the principal balance, and the total rent to be paid is at least equal to the estimated decrease in the market value of the security property.

(2) If the proposed activity is not likely to decrease the value of the security property, the lender may consent to the lease if the borrower agrees to use any damage compensation received from the lessee to repair damage to the site or dwelling, or to assign it to the lender to be applied to reduce the principal balance.
