######## Approval official's scope of authority.

(a)Any action that is not in conflict with the limitations in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall not be undertaken until the approval official has consulted with the appropriate Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Regional Director may or may not concur that the proposed action does or does not violate the provisions of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA). Pursuant to the requirements of the CBRA, and except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no maintenance or repair action may be taken for property located within a CBRS where:

(1) The action goes beyond maintenance, replacement-in-kind, reconstruction, or repair and would result in the expansion of any roads, structures or facilities. Water and waste disposal facilities as well as community facilities may be improved to the extent required to meet health and safety requirements but may not be improved or expanded to serve additional users, patients, or residents;

(2) The action is inconsistent with the purposes of the CBRA; or

(3) The property to be repaired or maintained was initially the subject of a financial transaction that violated the CBRA.
