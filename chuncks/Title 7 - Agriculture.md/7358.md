######## Average lean percentage.

The term "average lean percentage" means the value equal to the average percentage of the carcass weight comprised of lean meat for the swine slaughtered during the applicable reporting period. Whenever the packer changes the manner in which the average lean percentage is calculated, the packer shall make available to the Secretary the underlying data, applicable methodology and formulae, and supporting materials used to determine the average lean percentage, which the Secretary may convert either to the carcass measurements or lean percentage of the swine of the individual packer to correlate to a common percent lean measurement.
