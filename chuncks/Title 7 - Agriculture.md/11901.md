####### What procedures must State and local agencies use in procuring property, equipment, or services with program funds, and disposing of such property or equipment?

(d)The procedures that State and local agencies must follow in procuring property, equipment, or services with program funds, or disposing of such property or equipment, are contained in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, which set out the principles for determining whether specific costs are allowable. State, local, and Indian tribal governments must comply with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, while nonprofit subgrantees must comply with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR parts 400 and 415. State and local agencies may use procurement procedures established by State and local regulations as long as these procedures do not conflict with Federal regulations. Federal regulations do not relieve State or local agencies from responsibilities established in contracts relating to procurement of property, equipment, or services. The State agency is the responsible authority regarding the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements for the program.
