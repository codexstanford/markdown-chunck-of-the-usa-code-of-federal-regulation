####### Biodegradability information.

(c)If biodegradability is claimed by the manufacturer of a qualifying biobased product as a characteristic of that product, USDA requires that, if requested by procuring agencies, these claims be verified using the appropriate, product-specific ASTM biodegradability standard(s). Such testing must be conducted by an ASTM/ISO-compliant laboratory. The procuring official will decide whether biodegradability data must be brand-name specific in the case of products that are essentially of the same formulation. ASTM biodegradability standards include:

(1) D5338 "Standard Test Method for Determining Aerobic Biodegradation of Plastic Materials Under Controlled Composting Conditions";

(2) D5864 "Standard Test Method for Determining the Aerobic Aquatic Biodegradation of Lubricants or Their Components";

(3) D6006 "Standard Guide for Assessing Biodegradability of Hydraulic Fluids";

(4) D6400 "Standard Specification for Compostable Plastics" and the standards cited therein;

(5) D6139 "Standard Test Method for Determining the Aerobic Aquatic Biodegradation of Lubricants or Their Components Using the Gledhill Shake Flask";

(6) D6868 "Standard Specification for Biodegradable Plastics Used as Coatings on Paper and Other Compostable Substrates"; and

(7) D7081 "Standard Specification for Non-Floating Biodegradable Plastics in the Marine Environment."
