####### ยง 760.1706 Information to be furnished.

The affected farmer must furnish to the FSA county committee complete and accurate information sufficient to enable the FSA county committee or the Deputy Administrator to make the determinations required in this subpart. Such information must include, but is not limited to:

(a) A copy of the notice from, or other evidence of action by, the public agency which resulted in the dumping or removal of the affected farmer's whole milk from the commercial market.

(b) The specific weather or disaster event and its results on milk marketing for the loss period.

(c) The quantity and butterfat test of whole milk produced and marketed during the base period. This information must be a certified statement from the affected farmer's milk handler or any other evidence the FSA county committee accepts as an accurate record of milk production and butterfat tests during the base period.

(d) The average number of dry cows, bred heifers, and cows milked during the base period and during each pay period in the application.

(e) If the affected farmer markets his whole milk through a milk handler, a statement from the milk handler showing, for each pay period in the application period, the average price per hundred-weight of whole milk similar in quality to that marketed by the affected farmer during the base period used to determine his normal marketings. If the milk handler has information as to the transportation, administrative, and other costs of marketing which are normally incurred by producers who market through the milk handler but which the affected farmer did not incur because of the dumping or removal of his whole milk from the market, the average price stated by the milk handler will be the average gross price paid producers less any such costs. If the milk handler does not have such information, the affected farmer will furnish a statement setting forth such costs, if any.

(f) The amount of proceeds, if any, received by the affected farmer from the marketing of whole milk produced during the application period.

(g) The amount of any payments not subject to refund made to the affected farmer by the milk handler with respect to the whole milk produced during the application period and remove from the commercial market.

(h) Such other information as the FSA county committee may request to enable the FSA county committee or the Deputy Administrator to make the determinations required in this subpart.
