######## Establishment of management units.

(a)For the purpose of ME reviews, State agencies may, subject to FNS approval, establish "management units" which are different from project areas designated by FNS for participation in the program. For example, State-established welfare districts, regions or other administrative structures within a State may be so designated. Management units can be designated as either large, medium, or small for purposes of frequency of review. However, establishment of management units solely for the purpose of reducing the frequency of review will not be approved by FNS.
