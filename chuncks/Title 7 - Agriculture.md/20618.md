######## Release without compensation.

(f)Real estate security may be released by FSA without compensation when the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, except paragraph (a)(3) of this section, are met, and:

(1) The borrower has not received primary loan servicing or Disaster Set-Aside within the last 3 years;

(2) The security is:

(i) To be retained by the borrower and used as collateral for other credit, including partial graduation as specified in ยง 765.101; or

(ii) No more than 10 acres, or the minimum size that meets all State and local requirements for a division into a separate legal lot, whichever is greater, and is transferred without compensation to a person who is related to the borrower by blood or marriage.

(3) The property released will not interfere with access to or operation of the remaining farm;

(4) Essential buildings and facilities will not be released if they reduce the utility or marketability of the remaining property;

(5) Any issues arising due to legal descriptions, surveys, environmental concerns, utilities are the borrower's responsibility and no costs or fees will be paid by FSA;

(6) The security margin on each FLP direct loan will be above 150 percent after the release. The value of the retained security will normally be based on appraisals obtained as specified in ยง 761.7 of this chapter; however, well documented recent sales of similar properties can be used if the Agency determines the criteria have been met and a sound decision can be made without current appraisals;

(7) The release is approved by the FSA State Executive Director; and
