####### Interest rate.

(a)The loan must be written at an interest rate that:

(1) Is fixed over the term of the loan;

(2) Shall be negotiated between the lender and the borrower to allow the borrower to obtain the best available rate in compliance with all applicable laws.

(3) If the interest rate increases between the time of the issuance of the conditional commitment and the loan closing, the lender will submit appropriate documentation and underwriting analysis to confirm that the applicant is still eligible.

(4) The warehouse lender may charge an interest rate for interim construction financing that exceeds the underlying promissory note rate. After construction ends, the interest rate must revert to a rate that is no higher than the underlying promissory note rate. The Agency reserves the right to establish a maximum amount for the interim construction financing interest rate in the handbook, as necessary to further program goals and protect the best interests of the government.
