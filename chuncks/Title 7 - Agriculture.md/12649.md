####### Concurrent or separate food program operation.

(b)Distribution of commodities, with or without the Food Stamp Program, shall be made whenever an ITO submits to FNS a completed application for the Food Distribution Program on all or part of a reservation and the application is approved by FNS.

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when the Food Distribution Program is operating on all or part of a reservation, all eligible households within those boundaries may participate in the Food Distribution Program, or, if the ITO has elected concurrent operation of the Food Stamp Program, may elect to participate in either program, without regard to whether the household is an Indian tribal household.

(2) FNS may determine, based on the number of non-Indian tribal households located on all or part of a reservation, that concurrent operation is necessary. When such a determination has been made all households residing in such areas may apply to participate in either the Food Stamp or the Food Distribution Program.
