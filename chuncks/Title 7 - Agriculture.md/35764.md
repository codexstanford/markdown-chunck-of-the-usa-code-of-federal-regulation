###### Envelope delay distortion (EDD) measurement.

(d)(1) When specified by the borrower, EDD measurements shall be made on trunk circuits and nonloaded subscriber loops. For trunk circuits, the measurement shall be made between CO locations. For nonloaded subscriber loops, the measurement shall be made from the CO to the station protector of the NID at the customer's access location.

(2) EDD is a measure of the linearity or uniformity of the phase versus frequency characteristics of a transmission facility. EDD is also known as relative envelope delay (RED).

(3) EDD is specifically defined as the delay relative to the envelope delay at the reference frequency of 1,704 Hz. EDD is typically measured at two frequencies, one low and one high in the voiceband. The low frequency measurement is made at 604 Hz. The high frequency measurement is made at 2,804 Hz.
