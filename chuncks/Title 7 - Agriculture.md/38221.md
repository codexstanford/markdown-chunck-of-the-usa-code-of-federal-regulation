######## Block sale insurance contracts.

(a)The Associate Administrator is authorized in connection with block sale insurance contracts to authorize the Rural Development's fiscal agent to establish requirements for issuance of a replacement insurance contract when the original issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Rural Development's fiscal agent) is lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced. When a block sale insurance contract is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a duplicate may be issued to the registered holder upon receipt of an acceptable certificate of loss and an indemnity bond without surety. The certificate of loss should include the legal name and present address of the owner and address when issued, if different from the present address; the capacity of person certifying, if other than owner; the identity of the insurance contract, including series number, contract number, denomination, issue date, and form of inscription of registry, and the full statement of circumstances of loss. All available portions of an insurance contract that is mutilated, defaced, or partially destroyed should be submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Rural Development's fiscal agent) for determination as to whether a duplicate insurance contract can be issued without a certificate of loss and posting of an indemnity bond. In the event the holder of a block sales insurance contract obtains possession of the underlying notes, the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply.
