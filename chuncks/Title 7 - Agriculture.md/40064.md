######## Return of notes reduced to judgment.

(d)Notes which have been reduced to judgment are a part of the court records and ordinarily cannot be withdrawn and returned to the borrower even after satisfaction of the judgment.

Such requests will be referred to the Office of the General Counsel (OGC).
