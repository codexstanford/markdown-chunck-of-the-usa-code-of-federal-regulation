####### Collaborative arrangements.

(9)If the proposed project requires collaboration with other research scientists, corporations, organizations, agencies, or entities, such collaboration must be explained fully and justified. Evidence should be provided to assure peer reviewers that the collaborators involved agree with the arrangements. It should be specifically indicated whether or not such collaborative arrangements have the potential for any conflict(s) of interest. Proposals which indicate collaborative involvements must state which applicant is to receive any resulting grant award, since only one eligible applicant, as provided in ยง 3401.3 may be the recipient of a research project grant under one proposal.
