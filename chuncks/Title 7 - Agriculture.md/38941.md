(1) The criteria used in the basic formula are:

(i) State's percentage of National rural population-50 percent.

(ii) State's percentage of National rural population with income below the poverty level-50 percent.

(2) The data source for the first criterion is the most recent decennial Census data. The data source for the second criterion is the 5-year data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a State factor (SF).

SF (criterion (b)(1)(i) x 50 percent) + (criterion (b)(1)(ii) x 50 percent)
