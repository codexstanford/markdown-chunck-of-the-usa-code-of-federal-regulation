######## Alcohol production facility.

(1)An alcohol production facility is a facility in which alcohol, suitable for use by itself or in combination with other substances as a substitute for petroleum or petrochemical feedstocks and not suitable for beverage purposes, is manufactured from biomass.

(2) The alcohol production facility includes all facilities necessary for the production and storage of alcohol and the processing of the by-products of alcohol production. The intent is to limit the alcohol and by-products processing facilities to those facilities which are necessary to yield marketable products and necessary for the financial success of the project. Further refinements, such as gasoline blending or the construction of facilities which use the alcohol or by-products in another manufacturing process, are not considered part of the alcohol production facility.

(3) Application will be reviewed by both B&I personnel and the State Office engineer and forwarded to the National Office if approval is recommended.
