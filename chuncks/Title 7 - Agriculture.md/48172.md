####### Tax-exempt financing.

(c)The agency is prohibited from guaranteeing a project funded with tax-exempt financing. In cases where a project involves both tax-exempt and taxable financing, the portion of the project that involves taxable financing is eligible to receive a loan guarantee if that portion of the project is separate and distinct from the part that is financed by the tax-exempt obligation, and the guaranteed loan is not essential to issuance of the tax-exempt obligation.
