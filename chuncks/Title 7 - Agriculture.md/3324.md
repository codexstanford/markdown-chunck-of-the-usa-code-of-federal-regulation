######## ยง 29.123 Fees and charges.
######### Mandatory inspection.

(a)For each year, AMS will calculate the rate for services, per hour per program employee as described in ยง 29.123(b) and (c). The fee shall be paid by sellers of tobacco and assessed against the warehouse or receiving station operator irrespective of ownership or interest in the tobacco. When the warehouse or receiving station operator pays the Department, it is presumed the fee was collected from the seller. Inspection and related services shall be suspended or denied if the warehouse or receiving station operator fails to pay the fees and charges imposed under this section. The fee shall be based on total poundage of tobacco inspected and sold during each calendar month. The fee shall be due and payable on the first day of the immediately following month and on the day immediately following the last sale each marketing year. Mandatory inspection and certification services shall take precedence over permissive inspections, other than reinspections.
