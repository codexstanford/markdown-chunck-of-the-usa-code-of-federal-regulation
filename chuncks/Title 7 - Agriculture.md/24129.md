######## Bonding.

(a)The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may require handlers to secure bonds on deferred inventory reserve tonnage. Handlers may, in order to comply with the requirements of §§ 930.50 and 930.51 and regulations issued thereunder, secure bonds on restricted percentage cherries to temporarily defer the date that inventory reserve cherries must be held to any date requested by the handler. This date shall be not later than 60 days prior to the end of that crop year. Such deferment shall be conditioned upon the voluntary execution and delivery by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking within thirty (30) days after the Secretary announces the final restricted percentage under § 930.51. Such written undertaking shall be secured by a bond or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board that on or prior to the acceptable deferred date the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted percentage amount required by § 930.51.
