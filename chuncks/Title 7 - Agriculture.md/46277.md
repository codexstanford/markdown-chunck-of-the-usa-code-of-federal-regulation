####### ยง 4280.117 Determination of technical merit.
######## Further processing of applications.

(e)A project that is determined to have "technical merit" or "conditional technical merit" is eligible for further consideration for funding. Projects with "conditional technical merit" would be subject to funding conditions that would need to be met to ensure full technical merit prior to completion of the project. A project that is determined to be "without technical merit" is considered to be an incomplete application and therefore is not eligible to compete for funding.
