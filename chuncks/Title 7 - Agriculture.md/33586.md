(a) Borrowers shall make a diligent effort to extend electric service to all unserved persons within their service area who:

(1) Desire electric service; and

(2) Meet all reasonable requirements established by the borrower as a condition of service.

(b) If economically feasible and reasonable considering the cost of providing such service and/or the effects on all consumers' rates, such service shall be provided, to the maximum extent practicable, at the rates and minimum charges established in the borrower's rate schedules, without the payment by such persons, other than seasonal or temporary consumers, of a contribution in aid of construction. A seasonal consumer is one that demands electric service only during certain seasons of the year. A temporary consumer is a seasonal or year-round consumer that demands electric service over a period of less than five years.

(c) Borrowers may assess contributions in aid of construction provided such assessments are consistent with the policy set forth in this section.
