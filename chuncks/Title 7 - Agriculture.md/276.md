###### Offer of proof.

(6)Whenever evidence is deleted from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript or recording in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript or recording and record if the Judicial Officer decides that the Judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial. The Judge shall not allow the insertion of such excluded evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume considerable time at the hearing. In the latter event, if the Judicial Officer decides that the Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was both prejudicial and erroneous, the hearing may be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.
