######## Approved title insurance company.

A title insurance company, approved by the agency, (including its local representatives, employees, agents, and attorneys) that issues a policy of title insurance. Depending on the local practice, an approved title insurance company may also close loans, assumptions, credit sales, and voluntary conveyances and disburse funds in connection with agency loans. If the approved title insurance company does not close the loan itself, the loan closing functions may be performed by approved attorneys or closing agents authorized by the approved title insurance company.
