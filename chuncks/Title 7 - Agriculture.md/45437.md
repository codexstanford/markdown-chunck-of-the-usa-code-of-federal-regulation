###### ยง 3565.452 Decision to liquidate.

(a) A decision to liquidate shall be made when it is determined that the default cannot be cured through actions contained in ยง 3565.403 or it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Agency and the lender to liquidate. For interest accrual purposes, interest will accrue for 90 calendar days after the date the liquidation plan is approved by the Agency. If within 20 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the liquidation plan, the Agency fails to respond to the lender's proposal or advise the lender to make revisions to the plan that was submitted, the liquidation plan will be approved by default, and the 90 calendar day period for interest accrual will commence.
