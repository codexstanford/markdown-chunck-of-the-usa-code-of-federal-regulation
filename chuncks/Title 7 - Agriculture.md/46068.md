######## Changes and cost overruns.

(c)The Borrower is responsible for any changes or cost overruns. If any such change or cost overrun occurs, then any change order must be expressly approved by the Agency, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and neither the Lender nor Borrower will divert funds from purposes identified in the guaranteed loan application approved by the Agency to pay for any such change or cost overrun without the express written approval of the Agency. In no event will the current loan be modified or a subsequent guaranteed loan be approved to cover any such changes or costs. In the event of any of the aforementioned increases in cost or expenses, the Borrower must provide for such increases in a manner that does not diminish the Borrower's operating capital. Failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph (c) will be considered a Material Adverse Change in the Borrower's financial condition, and the Lender must address this matter, in writing, to the Agency's satisfaction.
