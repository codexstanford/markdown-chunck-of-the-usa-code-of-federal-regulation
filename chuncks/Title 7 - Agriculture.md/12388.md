(a)The processor must submit an end product data schedule, in a standard electronic format dictated by FNS, for approval before it may process donated foods into end products.

For National Processing Agreements, the end product data schedule must be approved by the Department. An end product data schedule must be submitted, and approved, for each new end product that a processor wishes to provide or for a previously approved end product in which the ingredients (or other pertinent information) have been altered. On the end product data schedule, the processor must describe its processing of donated food into an end product, including the following information:

(1) A description of the end product;

(2) The types and quantities of donated foods included;

(3) The types and quantities of other ingredients included;

(4) The quantity of end product produced; and

(5) The processing yield of donated food, which may be expressed as the quantity (pounds or cases) of donated food needed to produce a specific quantity of end product or as the percentage of raw donated food versus the quantity returned in the finished end product.
