###### Tests on 100 percent of completed cable.

(5)(i) The shield of each length of cable shall be tested for continuity using the procedures of ASTM D 4566-90.

(ii) Dielectric strength between all conductors and the shield shall be tested to determine freedom from grounds in accordance with paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section.

(iii) Each conductor in the completed cable shall be tested for continuity using the procedures of ASTM D 4566-90.

(iv) Dielectric strength between conductors shall be tested to ensure freedom from shorts and crosses in accordance with paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this section.

(v) Each conductor in the completed preconnectorized cable shall be tested for continuity.

(vi) Each length of completed preconnectorized cable shall be tested for split pairs.

(vii) The average mutual capacitance shall be measured on all cables. If the average mutual capacitance for the first 100 pairs tested from randomly selected groups is between 50 and 53 nF/km (80 to 85 nF/mile), the remainder of the pairs need not to be tested on the 100 percent basis. (See paragraph (h)(1) of this section).
