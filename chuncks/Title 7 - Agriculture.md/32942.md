CCC's approval of the application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.
