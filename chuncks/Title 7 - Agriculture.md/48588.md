####### Compromise settlement.

(m)Compromise settlements must be approved by the lender and the Agency. The lender must provide complete current financial information on all parties obligated for the loan. At a minimum, the compromise settlement must be equivalent to the value and timeliness of that which would be received from attempting to collect on the guarantee. Any guarantor cannot be released from liability until the full amount of the compromise settlement has been received. In determining whether to approve a compromise settlement, the Agency will consider, among other things, whether the compromise is more financially advantageous than collecting on the guarantee.
