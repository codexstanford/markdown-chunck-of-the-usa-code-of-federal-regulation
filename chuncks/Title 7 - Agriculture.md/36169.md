###### Crosstalk loss.

(4)(i) The rms output-to-output far-end crosstalk loss (FEXT) measured on the completed cable in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a test frequency of 150 kHz shall not be less than 68 decibel/kilometer (dB/km) (73 decibel/1000 ft (dB/1000 ft)). The rms calculation shall be based on the combined total of all adjacent and alternate pair combinations within the same layer and center to first layer pair combinations.

(ii) The FEXT crosstalk loss between any pair combination of a cable shall not be less than 58 dB/km (63 dB/1000 ft) at a frequency of 150 kHz. If the loss Kat a frequency Ffor length Lis known, then Kcan be determined for any other frequency For length Lby:

(iii) The near-end crosstalk loss (NEXT) as measured within and between units of a completed cable in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a frequency of 772 kHz shall not be less than the following mean minus sigma (M-S) crosstalk requirement for any unit within the cable:
