(3)Loans to other-than-public body applicants will be secured as follows:

(i) Utility-type facilities eligible for Rural Development assistance under paragraph (d) of this section such as water and sewer systems, natural gas distribution systems, electric systems, etc., will be secured as follows:

(A) Assignments of borrower income will be taken and perfected by filing, if legally permissable; and

(B) A lien will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts and similar property rights, including leasehold interest, used, or to be used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time the loan is approved or acquired with loan funds. In unusual circumstances where it is not feasible to obtain a lien on such land (such as land rights obtained from Federal or local government agencies, and from railroads) and the loan approval official `determines that the interest of the United States otherwise is secured adequately, the lien requirement may be omitted as to such land rights.

(C) When the loan is approved or the acquisition of real property is subject to an outstanding lien indebtedness, the next highest priority lien obtainable will be taken if the loan approval official determines that the loan is adequately secured.
