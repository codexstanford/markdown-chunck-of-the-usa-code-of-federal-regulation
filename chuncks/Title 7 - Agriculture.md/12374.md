####### ยง 250.30 Processing of donated foods into end products.
######## Purpose of processing donated foods.

(a)Donated foods are most commonly provided to processors to process into approved end products for use in school lunch programs or other food services provided by recipient agencies. The ability to divert donated foods for processing provides recipient agencies with more options for using donated foods in their programs. For example, donated foods such as whole chickens or chicken parts may be processed into precooked grilled chicken strips for use in the National School Lunch Program. In some cases, donated foods are provided to processors to prepare meals or for repackaging. Use of a commercial facility to repackage donated foods, or to use donated foods in the preparation of meals, is considered processing in this part.
