######## Civil money penalty formula.

(x)For each violation subject to a mandatory sanction, the State agency must use the following formula to calculate a civil money penalty imposed in lieu of disqualification:

(A) Determine the vendor's average monthly redemptions for at least the 6-month period ending with the month immediately preceding the month during which the notice of adverse action is dated;

(B) Multiply the average monthly redemptions figure by 10 percent (.10);

(C) Multiply the product from paragraph (l)(1)(x)(B) of this section by the number of months for which the store would have been disqualified. This is the amount of the civil money penalty, provided that the civil money penalty shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in ยง 3.91(b)(3)(v) of this title for each violation. For a violation that warrants permanent disqualification, the amount of the civil money penalty shall be the maximum amount specified in ยง 3.91(b)(3)(v) of this title for each violation. When during the course of a single investigation the State agency determines a vendor has committed multiple violations, the State agency must impose a CMP for each violation. The total amount of civil money penalties imposed for violations investigated as part of a single investigation may not exceed the amount specified in ยง 3.91(b)(3)(v) of this title as the maximum penalty for violations occurring during a single investigation.
