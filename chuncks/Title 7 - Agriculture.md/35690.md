###### Test equipment.

(3)(i) IR measurements shall be made with either an insulation resistance test set or a direct current (dc) bridge type megohmmeter.

(ii) The IR test set shall have an output voltage not to exceed 500 volts dc and shall be of the hand cranked or battery operated type.

(iii) The dc bridge type megohmmeter, which may be alternating current (ac) powered, shall have scales and multiplier which make it possible to accurately read IR from 1 megohm to 1 gigohm. The voltage applied to the conductors under test shall not exceed "250 volts dc" when using an instrument having adjustable test voltage levels. This will help to prevent breakdown of lightning arresters.
