###### ยง 4287.135 Substitution of lender.
####### e.g.,

(b) The Agency will not pay any loss or share in any costs (appraisal fees and environmental assessments) with a new lender unless a relationship is established through a substitution of lender in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. This includes situations where a lender is merged with or acquired by another lender and situations where the lender has failed and been taken over by a regulatory agency such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the loan is subsequently sold to another lender.

(c) Where the lender has failed and been taken over by the FDIC and the loan is liquidated by the FDIC rather than being sold to another lender, the Agency will pay losses and share in costs as if the FDIC were an approved substitute lender.

(d) In cases where there is a substitution of the lender, the Agency and the new lender must execute a new Form RD 4279-4, "Lender's Agreement," unless a valid Lender's Agreement already exists with the new lender.
