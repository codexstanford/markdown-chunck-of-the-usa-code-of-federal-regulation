######## Rolling acceptance

(s)means that the buyer accepts at time of purchase produce which is in the custody of the transportation company and under movement from shipping point, under the terms and conditions described in paragraphs (q) and (r) of this section, except that the buyer assumes full responsibility for transportation of the goods from time of purchase, has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition after time of purchase unless the goods at the time of sale were not in suitable shipping condition, and has no right of rejection on arrival. The buyer's remedy under this method of purchase is by recovery of damages from the shipper and not by rejection of the shipment. By agreement between the parties, however, the purchase may be made subject to inspection at any specified point while the car is rolling or in transit and the point at which the buyer will assume transportation charges may be specified without affecting the time of acceptance of the commodity.
