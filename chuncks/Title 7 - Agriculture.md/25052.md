####### ยง 981.47 Method of establishing salable and reserve percentages.

Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and supporting information supplied by the Board or from any other available information, that to designate the percentages of almonds during any crop year which shall be salable almonds and reserve almonds would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall designate such percentages. Except as provided in ยง 981.50 the salable and reserve percentages shall each be applied to the kernel weight of almonds received by a handler for his own account during the crop year. In establishing such salable and reserve percentages, the Secretary shall give consideration to the ratio of estimated trade demand (domestic plus export, less the handler carryover available to satisfy trade demand plus the desirable handler carryover at the end of the crop year) to the estimated production of marketable almonds (all expressed in terms of kernel weight) or the allocation quantity (marketable production plus almonds diverted to oil or feed when eligible for reserve satisfaction) whichever is applicable; the recommendation submitted to him by the Board; and such other information as he deems appropriate. The total of the salable and reserve percentages established each crop year shall equal 100 percent.
