######## Harvested

means the producer has removed the crop from the field by hand, mechanically, or by grazing of livestock. The crop is considered harvested once it is removed from the field and placed in a truck or other conveyance or is consumed through the act of grazing. Crops normally placed in a truck or other conveyance and taken off the crop acreage, such as hay are considered harvested when in the bale, whether removed from the field or not.
