######## Reservation of grazing rights.

(c)(1) NRCS may include in the terms and conditions of an easement a provision under which the landowner reserves grazing rights if NRCS determines that the reservation and use of the grazing rights:

(i) Is compatible with the land subject to the wetland reserve easement or 30-year contract,

(ii) Is consistent with the historical natural uses of the land and long-term wetland restoration, protection, and enhancement goals for which the wetland reserve easement or 30-year contract was established,

(iii) Is subject to a recorded exhibit to the deed outlining grazing purposes and limitations, and

(iv) Complies with a WRPO developed by NRCS, which may include a grazing management plan component that is consistent with the WRPO and is reviewed and modified as necessary, at least every 5 years.

(2) Compensation for easements or 30-year contracts where the grazing rights are reserved under this section will be based on the method described in ยง 1468.34, except such compensation will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the reserved grazing rights, as determined by NRCS.
