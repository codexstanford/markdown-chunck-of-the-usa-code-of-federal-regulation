######## Easement exchange

means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, relinquishes all or a portion of its rights or interests in an easement which are replaced by similar rights or interests in an easement that have equivalent or greater conservation value, acreage, and economic value to the United States on land that is not adjacent to the original easement area. NRCS is not required to exchange any of its rights or interests in an easement, and easement exchanges are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties with an interest in the easement.
