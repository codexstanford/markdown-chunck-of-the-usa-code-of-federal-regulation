######## Track sale,sale on track

(u)(1)ormeans a sale of produce on track after transit and after inspection or opportunity for inspection by the buyer, or his agent, who shall be considered to have waived any right to reject the commodity so purchased upon receipt by him or his duly authorized representative from the seller or his duly authorized representative of the bill of lading, delivery order, or other document enabling him to obtain the goods from the carrier.

(2) The above definition shall not be construed as depriving the buyer of a right to reparation when the unloading of the car demonstrates that a part of the lading which was not accessible to inspection was of a quality or condition materially inferior to that portion which was accessible to inspection; but notice of intention to file a claim for reparation must be given the seller within 24 hours after receipt by the buyer of the delivery order or bill of lading.

(3) If the seller gives the date of arrival when quoting price, the buyer shall, in the absence of any written memorandum of sale to the contrary, assume all charges that accrue on the shipment from the date of its arrival. If the seller fails to furnish the date of arrival when quoting price the buyer may, in the absence of any written memorandum of sale which includes the date of arrival or specific written statement as to who shall assume such charges as have accrued after arrival, assume that the shipment arrived at point of sale on the day and date upon which the purchase was made, and shall be liable only for such charges as would properly attach to a shipment arriving on the date the purchase was made.
