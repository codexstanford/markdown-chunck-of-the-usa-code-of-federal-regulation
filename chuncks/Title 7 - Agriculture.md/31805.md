######## Ineligible land.

(e)The land specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (7) of this section is not eligible for enrollment in ACEP-ALE:

(1) Lands owned by an agency of the United States, other than land held in trust for Indian Tribes;

(2) Lands owned in fee title by a State, including an agency or a subdivision of a State, or unit of local government;

(3) Land owned by a nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural use and related conservation values including those listed in the statute under eligible land unless the eligible land is owned on a transitional basis as part of an approved buy-protect-sell transaction;

(4) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction which, as determined by NRCS, provides similar restoration and protection as would be provided by enrollment in the program;

(5) Land where the purposes of the program would be undermined due to onsite or offsite conditions, such as risk of hazardous materials, permitted or existing rights-of-way, infrastructure development, or adjacent land uses;

(6) Land which NRCS determines to have unacceptable exceptions to clear title or insufficient legal access; or

(7) Land on which gas, oil, earth, or mineral rights exploration has been leased or is owned by someone other than the landowner is ineligible under ACEP-ALE unless it is determined by NRCS that the third-party rights will not harm or interfere with the conservation values or agricultural uses of the easement, that any methods of exploration and extraction will have only a limited and localized impact on the easement, and the limitations are specified in the ALE deed.
