####### Type of Value.

(1)The appraisal request must indicate whether the "market value", the "market value, subject to restricted rents", or any other type of value of the housing project and related facilities is to be concluded.

(i) A request for "market value, subject to restricted rents" means the appraisal will take into consideration any rent limits, rent subsidies, expense abatements, or restrictive-use conditions that will affect the property as a result of an agreement with the Agency or any other financing source. Each type of financing involved, including, but not limited to, interest credit subsidy, low-interest loans from other sources, tax-exempt bond financing, tax credits, and grants, must be valued separately in the appraisal.

(ii) A request for "market value" means the appraisal will take into consideration the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:

(A) Buyer and seller are typically motivated;

(B) Both parties are well informed or well advised and acting in what they consider their best interests;

(C) A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;

(D) Payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and

(E) The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.
