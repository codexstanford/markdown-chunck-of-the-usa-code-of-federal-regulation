######## Receiving at dehydrator.

(2)Any handler may arrange with the committee and the inspection service for the incoming inspection and certification to be based on samples of prunes drawn as prune plums and dehydrated in the same manner as the prunes to which they are referable. Where such arrangement is acceptable to the Committee as permitting the inspection and certification of the prunes to be comparable to an inspection and certification when based on samples drawn as prunes, such certification shall be acceptable for the purposes of this section if the inspector further certifies that the dehydration process of the prunes being certified resulted in prunes eligible to be received under the terms and conditions of this part.
