If mechanical cooling is provided and the period of occupancy encounters more than 700 cooling degree-days (CDD), as determined by an average of the previous 8 years based upon local climatological data published by the same source cited in paragraph IV C3a above, the thermal insulation requirements for 1,000 and less degree-days as stated in paragraph IV A shall apply.
