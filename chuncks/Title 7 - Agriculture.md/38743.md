######## Taxes and assessments.

(c)The closing agent will determine if all taxes and assessments against the property which are due and payable are paid at or before the time of loan closing. If the seller and the borrower have agreed to prorate any taxes or assessments which are not yet due and payable for the year in which the closing of the transaction takes place, the seller's proportionate share of the taxes and assessments will be deducted from the proceeds to be paid to seller at closing and will be added to the amount required to be paid by borrower at closing. Appropriate prorations as agreed upon between the borrower and seller may also be made for taxes paid by the seller which are applicable to a period after the closing date, and for common area maintenance fees, prepaid rentals, insurance (unless the borrower is to obtain a new policy of insurance), and growing crops.
