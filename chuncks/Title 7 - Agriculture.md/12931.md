####### Effects of reductions, suspensions and cancellations on the certification of eligible households.

(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, determinations of the eligibility of applicant households shall not be affected by reductions, suspensions or cancellations of allotments. State agencies shall accept and process applications during a month(s) in which a reduction, suspension or cancellation is in effect in accordance with the requirements of part 273. Determinations of eligibility shall also be made according to the provisions of part 273. If an applicant is found to be eligible for benefits and a reduction is in effect, the amount of benefits shall be calculated by reducing the maximum SNAP allotments amount by the appropriate percentage for the applicant's household size and then deducting 30 percent of the household's net SNAP income from the reduced maximum SNAP allotments amount. If an applicant is found to be eligible for benefits while a suspension or cancellation is in effect, no benefits shall be issued to the applicant until issuance is again authorized by FNS.
