####### ยง 1484.75 Cooperator response to compliance report.

(a) A Cooperator shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Cooperator does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Cooperator shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.

(b) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Cooperator owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Cooperator in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Cooperator a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to debt settlement policies and procedures in 7 CFR part 1403.
