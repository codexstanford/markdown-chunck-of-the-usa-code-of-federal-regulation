(E) In certain cases the State Director may assign up to 15 points to a preapplication, in addition to those that may be scored under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) (A) through (D), of this section. These points are primarily intended to address an unforeseen exigency or emergency, such as the loss of a community facility due to accident or natural disaster or the loss of joint financing if Rural Development funds are not committed in a timely fashion. However, the points may also be awarded to projects in order to improve compatibility/coordination between Rural Development's and other agencies' selection systems and to assist those projects that are the most cost effective. A written justification must be prepared and placed in the project file each time the State Director assigns these points.
