######## Primary Storm Sewer,Pipe Size.

C.-1.Pipe size for the primary storm sewer (any storm sewer or inlet lateral located in a street or other public right-of-way) shall have an inside diameter based on design analysis but not less than 15 inches. Where anticipated runoff from the five-year return frequency rainfall will not fill a 15 inch pipe, a primary storm sewer system usually is unnecessary.
