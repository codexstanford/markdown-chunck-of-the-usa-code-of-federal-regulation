####### Wetland restoration

means the rehabilitation of degraded or lost habitat in a manner such that:

(1) The original vegetation community and hydrology are, to the extent practical, re-established; or

(2) A community different from what likely existed prior to degradation of the site is established. The hydrology and native self-sustaining vegetation being established will substantially replace original habitat functions and values and does not involve more than 30 percent of the wetland restoration area.
