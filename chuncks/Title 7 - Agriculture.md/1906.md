###### Ineligibility for failing to certify compliance.

(b)Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, failing to certify compliance as specified in ยง 12.7 will result in ineligibility as follows:

(1) A Form AD-1026, or successor form, for the person must be filed with FSA for the reinsurance year in order for the person to be eligible for any Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for the reinsurance year. Persons will be ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy on their crop insurance policy if form AD-1026, or successor form, has not been filed with FSA for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date for their Federally-reinsured crop insurance policy.

(2) A person that has not filed an AD-1026 for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date may be eligible for premium subsidy for the reinsurance year if they provide information necessary for the person's filing of a Form AD-1026 if the person:

(i) Is unable to file a Form AD-1026 due to circumstances beyond the person's control, as determined by FSA; or

(ii) Files a Form AD-1026 in good faith and FSA subsequently determines that additional information is needed, but the person is unable to comply due to circumstances beyond the control of the person.

(3) A person who does not have Form AD-1026, or successor form, on file with FSA for the reinsurance year may be eligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy for the initial reinsurance year if the person can demonstrate they meet RMA's conditions for new to farming, new to crop insurance, a new entity, or have not previously been required to file form AD-1026.
