(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) or paragraph (d) of this section, no person may import any lot of prunes into the United States unless the prunes are inspected and an inspection certificate issued with respect thereto, and the lot meets the applicable grade requirements specified in exhibit A of this section and the average count (i.e., number) of the prunes in such lot is 100 or less per pound. In determining whether any lot conforms to the size requirement, the following tolerance shall apply: In a sample of 100 ounces, the count per pound of 10 ounces of smallest prunes may not vary from the count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more than 45 points.

(2) No person may import any lot of pitted prunes or pitted macerated prunes for human consumption as pitted or pitted macerated prunes unless the lot meets the applicable minimum grade requirements set forth in ยง 999.200 (exhibit A), except that skin or flesh damage shall not be scored as a defect in determining whether the prunes meet the grade requirements. Pitted and pitted macerated prunes shall not be subject to size and undersized requirements.

(3) No person may import any lot of pitted prunes for human consumption as pitted prunes unless the lot does not exceed an average of 0.5 percent by count of prunes with whole pits and/or pit fragments 2 mm or longer and four of ten subsamples examined have no more than 0.5 percent by count of prunes with whole pits and/or pit fragments 2 mm or longer.
