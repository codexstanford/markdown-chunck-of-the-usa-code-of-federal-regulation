##### ยง 1755.902 Minimum performance Specification for fiber optic cables.
###### Minimum bend diameter.,Minimum Bend Diameter

(5)For cable under loaded and unloaded conditions, the cable must have the minimum bend diameters indicated in paragraph 1.1.5,, of the ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(c)). For very small cables, manufacturers may specify fixed cable minimum bend diameters that are independent of the outside diameter. For cables having a non-circular cross-section, the bend diameter is to be determined using the thickness of the cable associated with the preferential bending axis.

(6) The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twelve colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, strippings, or markings provide fiber group identification.

(7) Cables must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements of this section to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications.
