######### Labeling Muscle Cut Covered Commodities of Multiple Countries of Origin from Animals Slaughtered in the United States.

(e)If an animal was born and/or raised in Country X and/or (as applicable) Country Y, and slaughtered in the United States, the resulting muscle cut covered commodities shall be labeled to specifically identify the production steps occurring in each country (e.g., "Born and Raised in Country X, Slaughtered in the United States"). If an animal is raised in the United States as well as another country (or multiple countries), the raising occurring in the other country (or countries) may be omitted from the origin designation except if the animal was imported for immediate slaughter as defined in ยง 65.180 or where by doing so the muscle cut covered commodity would be designated as having a United States country of origin (e.g., "Born in Country X, Raised and Slaughtered in the United States" in lieu of "Born and Raised in Country X, Raised in Country Y, Raised and Slaughtered in the United States").
