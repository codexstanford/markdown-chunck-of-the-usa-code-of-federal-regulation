####### School food authority claims review process.

(2)Prior to the submission of a monthly Claim for Reimbursement, each school food authority shall review the breakfast count data for each school under its jurisdiction to ensure the accuracy of the monthly Claim for Reimbursement. The objective of this review is to ensure that monthly claims include only the number of free, reduced price and paid breakfasts served on any day of operation to children currently eligible for such breakfasts.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, may advance funds available for the School Breakfast Program to a School Food Authority in an amount equal to the reimbursement estimated for the total number of breakfasts, including free and reduced price breakfasts, to be served to children for 1 month. The State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall require School Food Authorities who receive advances of funds under the provisions of this paragraph to make timely submissions of claims for reimbursement on a monthly basis and shall suspend advances of funds in the absence of such timely submissions. Following the receipt of claims the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall make such adjustments as are necessary in such advances of funds to insure that the total amount of reimbursement received by a School Food Authority for the fiscal year will not exceed an amount equal to the number of breakfasts, including free and reduced price breakfast, served to children times the respective rates of reimbursement assigned by the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, in accordance with ยง 220.9.
