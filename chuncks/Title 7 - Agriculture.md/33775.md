###### ยง 1714.8 Hardship rate loans.
####### Administrator's discretion.

(c)The Administrator may make a hardship rate loan if, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, the borrower has experienced a severe hardship. The Administrator shall consider, among other matters, whether factors beyond the control or substantial influence of the borrower have had severe adverse effect on the borrower's ability to provide service consistent with the purposes of the RE Act, and which prudent management could not reasonably anticipate and either prevent or insure against. Among the factors that may be considered are system damage due to unusual weather or other natural disasters or Acts of God, loss of substantial loads, extreme rate disparity compared to a contiguous utility, and other factors that cause severe financial hardship. The Administrator will also consider whether a hardship rate loan will provide significant relief to the borrower in dealing with the severe hardship.
