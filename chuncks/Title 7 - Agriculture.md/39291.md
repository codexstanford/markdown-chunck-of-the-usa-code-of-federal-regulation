() In lieu of receiving title opinions from the applicant's attorney, the applicant may use a title insurance company. If a title insurance company is used, the company must provide RD a title insurance binder, disclosing all title defects or restrictions, and include a commitment to issue a title insurance policy. The policy should be in an amount at least equal to the market value of the property as improved. The title insurance binder and commitment should be provided to RD prior to requesting closing instructions. RD will be provided a title insurance policy which will insure RD's interest in the property without any title defects or restrictions which have not been waived by RD.
