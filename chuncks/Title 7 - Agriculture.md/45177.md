####### " 'As-is' Value" or "Prospective Value".

(2)The appraisal request must indicate whether the "'as-is' value" or "prospective value" of the housing is to be concluded.

(i) " 'As-is' value" means the value of the housing and related facilities as of the effective date of the appraisal. It relates to what physically exists and is legally permissible at the time of the appraisal and excludes all hypothetical conditions.

(ii) "Prospective value" means the forecasted value of the housing and related facilities as of a specified future date. For Agency appraisals, this date will typically be the projected completion date of proposed new construction or rehabilitation.
