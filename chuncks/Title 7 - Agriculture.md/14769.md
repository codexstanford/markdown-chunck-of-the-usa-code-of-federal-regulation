(a)(1) At any time, but not later than the time fixed for filing proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, order and briefs, any party may file a motion proposing corrections to the transcript.

(2) Unless a party files such a motion in the matter prescribed, the transcript shall be presumed to be a true, correct, and complete transcript of the testimony given at the hearing and to contain an accurate description or reference to all exhibits received in evidence and made part of the hearing record. The transcript shall be deemed to be certified without further action by the ALJ.

(3) At any time prior to the filing of the ALJ's initial decision and after consideration of any objections filed as to the transcript, the ALJ may issue an order making any corrections in the transcript that the ALJ finds are warranted.
