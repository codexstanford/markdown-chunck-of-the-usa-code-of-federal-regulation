####### Permanent loan.

A permanent loan is defined as a mortgage loan usually covering development costs, interim loans, construction loans, financing expenses, marketing, administrative, legal, and other Agency approved costs. This loan differs from the construction loan in that financing goes into place after the project is completely constructed and open for occupancy. It is a long-term obligation, generally for a period of no less than 25 years and no more than 40 years.
