######## Expansion for current State agencies.

(e)In providing funds to State agencies that participated in the FMNP in the previous fiscal year, the Department shall consider on a case-by-case basis, the following:

(1) Whether the State agency utilized at least 80 percent of its prior year food grant. States that did not spend at least 80 percent of their prior year food grant may still be eligible for expansion funding if, in the judgment of the Department, good cause existed which was beyond the management control of the State, such as severe weather conditions, or unanticipated decreases in participant caseload in the WIC Program.

(2) Documentation supporting the funds expansion request as outlined in ยง 248.4(a)(19).
