##### ยง 12.5 Exemption.
###### Allowable variances.

(6)(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, no person shall be determined to be ineligible for benefits as a result of the failure of such person to apply a conservation system if NRCS determines that-

(A) The failure is technical and minor in nature and that such violation has little effect on the erosion control purposes of the conservation plan applicable to the land on which the violation has occurred; or

(B) The failure is due to circumstances beyond the control of the person; or

(C) NRCS grants a temporary variance from the practices specified in the plan for the purpose of handling a specific problem, including weather, pest, and disease problems, which NRCS determines cannot reasonably be addressed except through such variance.

(ii) If the person's request for a temporary variance involves the use of practices or measures to address weather, pest, or disease problems, NRCS shall make a decision on whether to grant the variance during the 30-day period beginning on the date of receipt of the request. If NRCS fails to render a decision during the period, the temporary variance shall be considered granted unless the person seeking the variance had reason to know that the variance would not be granted. In determining whether to grant a variance for natural disasters such as weather, pest, or disease problems, NRCS will consider such factors as:

(A) The percent of a stand damaged or destroyed by the event;

(B) The percent of expected crop production compared to normal production for that crop;

(C) The documented invasion of non-native insects, weeds, or diseases for which no recognized treatment exists;

(D) Whether an event is severe or unusual based on historical weather records; and

(E) Other specific circumstances caused by a natural event that prevented the implementation of conservation practices or systems, installation of structures, or planting of cover crops.
