####### ยง 1493.470 Evidence of export.
######## Time limit for submission of evidence of export.

(b)The exporter must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in:

(1) Significant financial harm to CCC;

(2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program;

(3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or

(4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such extension is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.
