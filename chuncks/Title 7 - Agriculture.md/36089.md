###### Conductors and conductor insulation.,Dimensions and Permissible Variations

(b)(1) Each conductor must be a solid round wire of commercially pure annealed copper. Conductors must meet the requirements of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) B 3-90 except that requirements forare waived and elongation requirements are superseded by this section.

(2) The minimum conductor elongation in the final wire must comply with the following limits when tested in accordance with ASTM E 8-91.

(3) Joints made in conductors during the manufacturing process may be brazed, using a silver alloy solder and nonacid flux, or they may be welded using either an electrical or cold welding technique. In joints made in uninsulated conductors, the two conductor ends must be butted. Splices made in insulated conductors need not be butted but may be joined in a manner acceptable to RUS.

(4)(i) The tensile strength of any section of a conductor containing a factory joint must not be less than 85 percent of the tensile strength of an adjacent section of the solid conductor of equal length without a joint.
