(b)At least once every five years, the Board will review the geographical distribution of United States production of pecans and the quantity or value of imports. The review will be conducted through an audit of state crop production and Customs figures and Board assessment records. If warranted, the Board will recommend to the Secretary that the membership on the Board be altered to reflect any changes in the geographical distribution of domestic pecan production and the quantity or value of imports. If the level of imports fluctuates versus domestic pecan production, importer members may be added to or reduced from the Board.
