(a) To the greatest extent practical, loans are limited to providing and improving electric facilities to serve consumers that are RE Act beneficiaries. When it is determined by the Administrator to be necessary in order to furnish or improve electric service in rural areas, loans may, under certain circumstances, be made to finance electric facilities to serve consumers that are not RE Act beneficiaries.

(b) Loan funds may be approved for facilities to serve non-RE Act beneficiaries only if:

(1) The primary purpose of the loan is to furnish or improve service for RE Act beneficiaries; and

(2) The use of loan funds to serve non-RE Act beneficiaries is necessary and incidental to the primary purpose of the loan.
