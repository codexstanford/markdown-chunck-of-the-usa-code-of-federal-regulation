(c)Borrowers are required to supply such financial information as the Agency deems necessary to determine whether they are able to graduate to other credit. At a minimum, the financial statements requested from the borrower must include a balance sheet and a statement of income and expenses. Ordinarily, the financial statements will be those normally required at the end of the particular borrower's fiscal year. For borrowers who are not requested to furnish audited financial statements, the balance sheet and statement of income and expenses may be of the borrower's own format if the borrower's financial situation is accurately reflected. The borrower has 60 days for group type loans and 30 days for individual type loans to supply the financial information requested.
