####### ยง 1400.210 Deceased and incapacitated persons.

If the person dies or is incapacitated before a determination is made that the person is "actively engaged in farming," the representative of the deceased person's estate or the incapacitated person, or other person if necessary, must provide the determining authority information to verify that the person did make a conscious effort to and would have been determined to be actively engaged in farming if not for the person's death or incapacitation. If the person dies or is incapacitated after being determined to be "actively engaged in farming," the determining authority will allow the determination to be in effect for that program year or fiscal year, as applicable. However, the following year the person or the person's estate must meet all necessary requirements in order to be determined to be "actively engaged in farming" for that year.
