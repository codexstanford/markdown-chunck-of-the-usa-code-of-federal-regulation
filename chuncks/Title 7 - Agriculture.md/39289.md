######## Rights-of-way and easements.

(A)Applicants are responsible for and will obtain valid, continuous and adequate rights-of-way and easements needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Form RD 442-20, "Right-of-Way Easement," may be used. When a site is for major structures for utility-type facilities such as a reservoir or pumping station and the applicant is able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such a site rather than a fee simple title, the applicant will furnish a title report thereon by the applicant's attorney showing ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances, if any. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain and record such releases, consents or subordinations to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens or other instruments as may be necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility and give Rural Development the required security.
