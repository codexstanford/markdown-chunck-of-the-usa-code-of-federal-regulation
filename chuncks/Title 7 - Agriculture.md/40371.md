######## Bidding.

(7)The State Director will designate an individual to bid on behalf of the Government unless judicial proceedings or State nonjudicial foreclosure law provides for someone other than an Rural Development employee to enter the Government's bid. When the State Director determines attendance of an Rural Development employee at the sale might pose physical danger, a written bid may be submitted to the Marshal, Sheriff, or other party in charge of holding the sale. The Government's bid will be entered when no other party makes a bid or when the last bid will result in the property being sold for less than the bid authorized in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

(i) When Rural Development is the senior lienholder, only one bid will be entered, and that will be for the amount authorized by the State Director.
