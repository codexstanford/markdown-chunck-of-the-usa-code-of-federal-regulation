######## Lien search.

(2)The County Supervisor will obtain a current lien search report to determine the effect that liens of other parties will have on liquidation, the record lienholders to whom notices of sale will be given, and the distribution that will be made of the sales proceeds. Normally, lien searches should be obtained from the same source as is used when making a loan. If obtaining the searches from third party sources causes undue delay which interferes with orderly liquidation, searches may be made by the County Supervisor. If the lien search is made by third parties, the borrower will pay the cost from personal funds or if the borrower refuses, the agency will pay the cost and charge it to the borrower's account in accordance with the security instrument or EO Loan Agreement. The records to be searched and the period covered by the search will be in accordance with a State supplement.
