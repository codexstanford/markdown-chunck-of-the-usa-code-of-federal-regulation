####### Limitation on indirect costs.

(3)

(a) Some Federal programs may be subject to laws that limit the amount of indirect cost that may be allowed. Agencies that sponsor programs of this type will establish procedures which will assure that the amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such program does not exceed the maximum allowable under the statutory limitation or the amount otherwise allowable under these principles, whichever is the smaller.

(b) When the amount allowable under a statutory limitation is less than the amount otherwise allocable as indirect costs under these principles, the amount not recoverable as indirect costs under a program may not be shifted to another federally sponsored program or contract.

(G) Cost incurred by other agencies of the State.
