######## Default.

Failure of the borrower to observe the agreements with Rural Development as contained in notes, security instruments, and similar or related instruments. Some examples of default or factors to consider in determining whether a borrower is in default are when a borrower:

Is delinquent, and the borrower's refusal or inability to pay on schedule, or as agreed upon, is due to lack of diligence, lack of sound farming or other operation, or other circumstances within the borrower's control.

Ceases to conduct farming or other operations for which the loan was made or to carry out approved changed operations.

Has disposed of security or EO property without Rural Development, has not cared properly for such property, has not accounted properly for such property or the proceeds from its sale, or taken some action which resulted in bad faith or other violations in connection with the loan.

Has progressed to the point to be able to obtain credit from other sources, and has agreed in the note or other instrument to do so but refuses to comply with that agreement.
