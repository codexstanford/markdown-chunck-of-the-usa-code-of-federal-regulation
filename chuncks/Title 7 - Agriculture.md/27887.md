(a) Upon the termination of this plan, the Board shall recommend not more than five of its members to the Secretary to serve as trustees for the purpose of liquidating the affairs of the Board. Such persons, upon designation by the Secretary, shall become trustees of all funds and property then in the possession or under control of the Board including claims for any funds unpaid or property not delivered or any other claim existing at the time of such termination.

(b) The said trustees shall (1) continue in such capacity until discharged by the Secretary; (2) carry out the obligations of the Board under any contracts or agreements entered into by it pursuant to this plan; (3) account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property on hand, together with all books and records of the Board and of the trustees, to such person or persons as the Secretary may direct; and (4) upon the request of the Secretary execute such assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person or persons full title and right to all of the funds, property, and claims vested in the Board of the trustees pursuant to this section.

(c) Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been transferred or delivered pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same obligation imposed upon the Board and upon the trustee.

(d) A reasonable effort shall be made by the Board or its trustees to return to producers and importers any residual funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation. If it is found impractical to return such remaining funds to producers and importers, such funds shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate.
