##### ยง 1.167 Conference.
###### Manner of the Conference.

(b)(1) The conference shall be conducted by telephone or correspondence unless the Judge determines that conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication:

(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;

(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or

(iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by telephone or correspondence. If the Judge determines that a conference conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the conference, the conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference, by telephone, or by correspondence.

(2) If the conference is not conducted by telephone or correspondence, the conference shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the Judge determines that conducting the conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference:

(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;

(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or

(iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication.
