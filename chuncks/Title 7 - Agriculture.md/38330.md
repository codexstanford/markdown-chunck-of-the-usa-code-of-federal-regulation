######## Final payment.

(vi)(A) When the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year warranty, the insurer must provide an insured 10-year warranty policy (or a binder if the policy is not available) before final payment is made to the builder.

(B) Final payment of the amount due on the contract or disbursal of the Agency loan funds where an interim loan was used will be made only upon completion of the entire contract, final inspection by the Agency, acceptance of the work by the Agency and the borrower, issuance of any and all final permits and approvals for the use and occupancy of the structure by any applicable state and local governmental authorities, and compliance by the contractor with all terms and conditions of the contract. In the event the work of construction is delayed or interrupted by reason of fire, flood unusually stormy weather, war, riot, strike, an order, requisition or regulation of any governmental body (excluding delays related to possible defects in the contractor's performance and excluding delays caused by the necessity of securing building permits or any required inspection procedures connected therewith) or other contingencies reasonably unforeseeable and beyond the reasonable control of the contractor, then with the written consent of the Agency, the date of completion of the work may be extended by the owner by the period of such delay, provided that the contractor shall give the owner and the Agency written notice within 72 hours of the occurrence of the event causing the delay or interruption.

(C) Prior to making final payment on the contract when a surety bond is not used or disbursing Agency loan funds when an interim loan was used, the Agency will be provided with a Form RD 1924-9, "Certificate of Contractor's Release," and Form RD 1924-10, "Release by Claimants." executed by all persons who furnished materials or labor in connection with the contract. The borrower should furnish the contractor with a copy of the "Release by Claimants" form at the beginning of the work in order that the contractor may obtain these releases as the work progresses.
