######## Covenants, conditions and restrictions.

(e)Sites in subdivisions shall be protected by covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) to preserve the character, value, and amenities of the residential community and to avoid or mitigate potential environmental impacts unless, an exception is granted by RHS after considering the suitability of local ordinances, zoning, and other land use controls.

(1) CC&Rs shall be recorded in the public land records and specifically referenced in each deed.

(2) The intent of the CC&Rs is to assure the developers that the purchasers will use the land in conformance with the planned objectives for the community. In addition, the CC&Rs should assure the purchasers that the land covered by the CC&Rs will be used as planned and that other purchasers will use and maintain the land as planned to prevent changes in the character of the neighborhood that would adversely impact values or create a nuisance.
