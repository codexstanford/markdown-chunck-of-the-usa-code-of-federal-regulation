####### Delinquent debt

means a debt that is not satisfied on or before the date of delinquency. To avoid delinquency or ineligibility due to a delinquent debt, a debtor may enter into a written payment agreement acceptable to the insurance provider or FCIC to pay any such debt as long as all payments are made by the due dates specified in such written payment agreement. A delinquent debt does not include debts discharged in bankruptcy or any debt to an insurance provider's agent.
