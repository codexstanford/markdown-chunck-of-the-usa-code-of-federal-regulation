######## Suballocation by the State Director.

(j)See ยง 1940.552(j) of this subpart. The State Director will suballocate funds to the District Offices and may, at his/her option, suballocate to the County Offices. The State Director will use the same basic formula criteria, data source and weight for suballocating funds within the State as used by the National Office in allocating to the States as described in ยง 1940.565 (b) and (c) of this section. The suballocations to District or County Offices will not be reduced or restricted unless written approval is received from the National Office in response to a written request from the State Director. The State Director's request must include the reasons for the requested action (e.g., high housing inventory and/or high housing delinquency).
