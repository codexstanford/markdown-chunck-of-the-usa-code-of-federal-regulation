######## Enrolled child

means a child whose parent or guardian has submitted to an institution a signed document which indicates that the child is enrolled for child care. In addition, for the purposes of calculations made by sponsoring organizations of family day care homes in accordance with §§ 226.13(d)(3)(ii) and 226.13(d)(3)(iii), "enrolled child" (or "child in attendance") means a child whose parent or guardian has submitted a signed document which indicates that the child is enrolled for child care; who is present in the day care home for the purpose of child care; and who has eaten at least one meal during the claiming period. For at-risk afterschool care centers, outside-school-hours care centers, or emergency shelters, the term "enrolled child" or "enrolled participant" does not apply.
