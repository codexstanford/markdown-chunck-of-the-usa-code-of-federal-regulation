######## Use of trustee or other similar paying agent.

(ii)The use of a trustee or other similar paying agent by the other lender in a joint financing arrangement is acceptable to the United States. A trustee or other similar paying agent will not normally be used for the United States portion of the funding unless required to comply with State law. The responsibilities and authorities of any trustee or other similar paying agent on projects that include United States funds must be clearly specified by written agreement and approved by the State Director and Regional Attorney. The United States must be able to deal directly with the borrower to enforce the provisions of loan and grant agreements and perform necessary servicing actions.
