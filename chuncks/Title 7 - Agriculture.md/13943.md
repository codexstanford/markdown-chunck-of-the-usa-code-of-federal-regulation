######## Standards for shelter costs.

(d)Legislation governing the S-SNAP requires that State plans must address the needs of households with high shelter costs relative to their income. If a State chooses to standardize shelter costs under the S-SNAP, it must, therefore, use multiple standards that take into consideration households with high shelter costs versus those with low shelter costs. A State is prohibited from using a single standard based on average shelter costs for all households participating in an S-SNAP.
