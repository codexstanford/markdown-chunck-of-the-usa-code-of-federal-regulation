###### ยง 3560.409 Subordinations or junior liens against security property.
####### General.,i.e.,

(a)Borrowers must obtain Agency consent prior to entering into any financial transaction that will require a subordination of the Agency security interest in the property, or lien subordination, (granting of a prior interest to another lender.) Prior to Agency consent, environmental review requirements must be completed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970. Borrowers must use an Agency approved lien subordination agreement.

(1) If a lien is placed against property serving as security for an Agency loan without prior Agency consent, the Agency will declare the borrower to be in default and will pursue liquidation of the borrower's loans in accordance with the procedures specified in ยง 3560.457, unless an agreement can be reached between the borrower and the Agency to work out removal of the lien or post approve the lien.

(2) Subordinations or junior liens need not encompass the entire site, (e.g., a subordination or junior lien requested to permit an interim lender to advance construction funds may only cover the portion of the site proposed for construction.)

(3) The subordination or junior lien must be for a specific amount.

(4) The subordination or junior lien must not adversely impact the Agency's ability to service the loan according to the requirements of this part.
