######## Use of Form RD 426-1, "Valuations of Buildings."

(e)The minimum insurance required will be indicated in the appraisal report by the employee who makes the appraisal of property that includes insurable buildings. In the case where no real estate appraisal is required or the appraisal report does not indicate the minimum insurance coverage, Form RD 426-1 will be prepared by the County Supervisor. Reevaluation of the buildings will not be done on appraisal reports; however, when new buildings are constructed or values increase or decrease materially and reevaluation is necessary to properly reflect the buildings' security interest of RD, the County Supervisor will prepare or revise Form RD 426-1 as appropriate. Changes made on an existing Form RD 426-1 will be dated and initialed. The reason for any deletion will be noted on the Form.
