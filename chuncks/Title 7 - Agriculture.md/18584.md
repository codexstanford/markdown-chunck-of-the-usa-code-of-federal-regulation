######## Finding of no significant impact (FNSI).

(l)(40 CFR 1508.13) "Finding of No Significant Impact" means a document by a Federal agency briefly presenting the reasons why an action not otherwise excluded (ยง 1508.4) will not have a significant effect on the human environment, and an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared. It shall include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and shall note any other environmental documents related to it (ยง 1501.7(a)(5)). If the assessment is included, the finding need not repeat any of the discussion in the assessment but may incorporate it by reference.
