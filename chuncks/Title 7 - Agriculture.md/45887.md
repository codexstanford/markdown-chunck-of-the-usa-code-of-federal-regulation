Borrowers and lenders are encouraged to file preapplications and obtain Agency comments before completing an application. However, if they prefer, borrowers and lenders may file a complete application without filing a preapplication. The Agency will neither accept nor process preapplications and applications unless a lender has agreed to finance the proposal. For borrowers other than individuals, a Dun and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is required, which can be obtained online at. Guaranteed loans exceeding $600,000 must be submitted under the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section. However, guaranteed loans of $600,000 and less may be submitted under the requirements of either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
