(1) Including in all decision documents and supporting environmental documents a discussion of all alternatives considered in the decision. Alternatives to be considered in reaching a decision will be available to the public.

(2) Submitting relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses with other decision documents through the review process.

(3) Including in the record of formal rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings relevent environmental documents, comments and responses.
