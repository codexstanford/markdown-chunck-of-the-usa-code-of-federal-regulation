####### ยง 800.84 Inspection of grain in land carriers, containers, and barges in single lots.
######## Partial inspection-heavily loaded,General.

(f)-(1)When an "In" movement of bulk grain is offered for inspection at rest in a carrier or container and is loaded in such a manner that it is possible to secure only door-probe or shallow-probe samples, the container shall be considered to be "heavily loaded," and the request for inspection either shall be dismissed or a partial inspection shall be made. If the request is for the inspection of an "Out" movement of grain, the request shall be dismissed on the grounds that the grain is not accessible for a correct "Out" inspection.
