(4) The inner jacket thickness at any point must not be less than 0.5 mm (0.020 in.). The thickness must be determined from measurements on 50 mm (2 in.) samples taken not less than 0.3 m (1 ft) from either end of the wire. The average must be determined from 4 readings taken approximately 90 &#xB0;apart on any cross section of the samples. The maximum and minimum points must be determined by exploratory measurements.
