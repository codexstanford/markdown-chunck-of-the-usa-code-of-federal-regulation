However, the examination fee shall be refunded if an application is voluntarily withdrawn or abandoned pursuant to ยง 97.23(a) before the examination has begun. The certificate issuance fee shall be refunded if an application is voluntarily withdrawn or abandoned after an examination has been completed and before a certificate has been issued.
