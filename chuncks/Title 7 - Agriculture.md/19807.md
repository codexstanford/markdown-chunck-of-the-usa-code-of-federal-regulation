####### ยง 760.1705 Fair market value of milk.

(a) The FSA county committee will determine the fair market value of the affected farmer's dumped milk normal marketings, which, for the purposes of this subpart, will be the sum of the net proceeds such farmer would have received for his normal marketings in each of the pay periods in the application period but for the qualifying disaster event.

(b) The FSA county committee will determine the net proceeds the affected farmer would have received in each of the pay periods in the application period:

(1) In the case of an affected farmer who markets his whole milk through a milk handler, by multiplying the affected farmer's normal marketings for each such pay period by the average net price per hundred-weight of whole milk paid during the pay period by such farmer's milk handler in the same area for whole milk similar in quality and butterfat test to that marketed by the affected farmer in the base period used to determine his normal marketings; or

(2) In the case of an affected farmer whose commercial market consists of direct retail sales to consumers, by multiplying the affected farmer's normal marketings for each such pay period by the average net price per hundredweight of whole milk, as determined by the FSA county committee, which other producers in the same area who marketed their whole milk through milk handlers received for whole milk similar in quality and butterfat test to that marketed by the affected farmer during the base period used to determine his normal marketings.

(c) In determining the net price for whole milk, the FSA county committee will deduct from the gross price any transportation, administrative, and other costs of marketing which it determines are normally incurred by the affected farmer but which were not incurred because of the removal of his whole milk from the commercial market.
