####### Clarification of proposals.

(h)The contracting committee may elect not to hold any clarifying discussions and recommend awarding the contract to the low responsive bidder. Otherwise, the contracting committee must give at least each of the three apparent lowest evaluated bidders an equal opportunity to participate in discussions for the purpose of resolving questions regarding the specification and contract terms and to arrive at a final price. Neither prices of other bids nor relative ranking of any bidder are to be revealed under any circumstances. Such discussions may be held by telephone or similar means provided at least each of the three apparent lowest evaluated bidders have an equal opportunity to participate. Upon completion of the clarifying discussions, the contracting committee will determine the lowest evaluated responsive bid. If no bids are responsive after the contracting committee has completed clarifying discussions, no contract award can be made under the informal bidding procedure.
