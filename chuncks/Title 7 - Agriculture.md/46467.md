####### ยง 4280.156 Selecting EA and REDA grant applications for award.
######## Selection of applications for funding.

(c)Using the ranking created under paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will consider the score an application has received compared to the scores of other ranked applications, with higher scoring applications receiving first consideration for funding. If two or more applications score the same and if remaining funds are insufficient to fund each such application, the Agency will distribute the remaining funds to each such application on a pro-rata basis. At its discretion, the Agency may also elect to redirect unused funds into the RES/EEI program or allow any remaining multi-year funds to be carried over to the next fiscal year rather than funding on a pro-rata basis.
