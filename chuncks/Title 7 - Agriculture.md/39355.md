######## Method of accounting and preparation of financial statements.

(2)Annual organization-wide financial statements must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), unless State statute, tribal law or regulatory agencies provide otherwise, or an exception is granted by the Agency. An organization may maintain its accounting records on a basis other than accrual accounting, and make the necessary adjustments so that annual financial statements are presented on the accrual basis.
