####### Interest termination during bankruptcy.

(10)When a borrower files a Chapter 7 liquidation plan, the lender shall immediately notify the Agency and submit a liquidation plan. The Agency will establish an interest termination date based on the date Interest was last paid to the lender. When a borrower files either a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring plan, the Agency and lender shall meet to discuss the bankruptcy procedure, the ability of the borrower to meet their restructuring plan, the lender's treatment of accruing interest, and potentially establish an interest termination date for the guaranteed loan. If the restructuring bankruptcy Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 is converted to a liquidation bankruptcy Chapter 7 by court order, the interest termination date will be the date of such conversion.
