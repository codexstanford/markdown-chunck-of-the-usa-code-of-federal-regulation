######## Reduction or termination of benefits.

(v)If the household files a complete report resulting in reduction or termination of benefits, the State agency shall send an adequate notice, as defined in ยง 271.2 of this chapter. The notice must be issued so that it will be received by the household no later than the time that its benefits are normally received. If the household fails to provide sufficient information or verification regarding a deductible expense, the State agency will not terminate the household, but will instead determine the household's benefits without regard to the deduction.
