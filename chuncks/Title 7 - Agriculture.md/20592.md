(xv) If a borrower with an SAA mortgage is refinancing a loan held by a lender, subordination of the SAA mortgage may only be approved when the refinanced loan does not increase the amount of debt; and

(4) The Agency will approve a request for subordination of real estate to a lessee if the conditions in paragraphs (b)(3)(viii) through (xvi) of this section are met.
