(5)Where the right of use or control of real property not owned by the applicant/borrower is essential to the successful operation of the facility during the life of the loan, such right will be evidenced by written agreements or contracts between the owner(s) of the property and the applicant/borrower. Lease agreements shall not contain provisions for restricted use of the site of facility, forfeiture or summary cancellation clauses and shall provide for the right to transfer and lease without restriction. Lease agreements will ordinarily be written for a term at least equal to the term of the loan. Such lease contracts or agreements will be approved by the Rural Development loan approval official with the advice and counsel of the Regional Attorney, OGC, as to the legal sufficiency of such documents. A copy of the lease contract or agreement will be included in the loan docket.
