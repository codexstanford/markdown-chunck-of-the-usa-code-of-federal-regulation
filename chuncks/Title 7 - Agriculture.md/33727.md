(7)If the borrower is applying under the rate disparity and consumer income tests for either a municipal rate loan subject to the interest rate cap or a hardship rate loan, the application must provide a breakdown of residential consumers either by county, Tribal land, or by census tract. In addition, if the borrower serves in 2 or more States, the application must include a breakdown of all ultimate consumers by State. This breakdown may be a copy of Form EIA 861 submitted by the Borrower to the Department of Energy or in a similar form.7 CFR 1714.7(b) and 1714.8(a). To expedite the processing of loan applications, RUS strongly encourages distribution borrowers to provide this information to the GFR prior to submitting the application.
