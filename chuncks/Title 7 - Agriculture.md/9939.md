######## Disregards.

(c)In conducting management evaluations or audits for any fiscal year, the State agency, FNS or OIG may disregard overpayment which does not exceed $100 or, in the case of State agency administered programs, does not exceed the amount established by State law, regulations or procedures as a minimum for which claims will be made for State losses generally. No overpayment shall be disregarded, however, when there are unpaid claims for the same fiscal year from which the overpayment can be deducted or when there is substantial evidence of violation of criminal law or civil fraud statutes.
