######## Form of payment.

(b)(1) Security instruments may be satisfied or the financing statements may be terminated on receipt of final payment in currency, coin, U.S. Treasury check, cashier's or certified check, bank draft, postal or bank money order, or a check issued by a party known to be financially responsible.

(2) When the final payment is tendered in a form other than those mentioned above, the security instruments will not be satisfied until 15 days after the date of the final payment. However, in UCC States the termination statement will be signed and sent to the borrower within 10 days after receipt of the borrower's written request but not until the 10th day unless it previously has been ascertained that the payment check or other instrument has been paid by the bank on which it was drawn. (See subsection (c) of this section for the reason for the 10-day requirement.)
