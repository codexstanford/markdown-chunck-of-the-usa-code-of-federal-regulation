####### ยง 761.204 Methods of allocating funds to State Offices.

FO, CL, and OL loan funds are allocated to State Offices using one or more of the following allocation methods:

(a) Formula allocation, if data, as specified in ยง 761.205, is available to use the formula for the State.

(b) Administrative allocation, if the Agency cannot adequately meet program objectives with a formula allocation. The National Office determines the amount of an administrative allocation on a case-by-case basis.

(c) Base allocation, to ensure funding for at least one loan in each State, District, or County Office. In making a base allocation, the National Office may use criteria other than those used in the formula allocation, such as historical Agency funding information.
