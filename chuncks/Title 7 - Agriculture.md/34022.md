####### Distribution borrowers.

(a)The provisions of this subpart apply to all distribution borrowers that obtain a loan or loan guarantee from RUS approved on or after January 29, 1996. Distribution borrowers that obtain a lien accommodation or any other form of financial assistance from RUS after January 29, 1996, may be required to execute a new loan contract and new mortgage. Moreover, any distribution borrower may submit a request to RUS that a new loan contract and new mortgage be executed. Within the constraints of time and staff resources, RUS will attempt to honor such requests. Borrowers must first obtain the concurrence of any other mortgagees on their existing mortgage before a new mortgage can be executed.
