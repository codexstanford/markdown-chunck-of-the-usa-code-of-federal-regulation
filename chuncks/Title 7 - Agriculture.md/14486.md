###### Appendix A to Part 277 - Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Administration of SNAP by State Agencies
####### Capital expenditures.

(3)The cost, net of any credits, of facilities, equipment, other capital assets, and repairs which materially increase the value or useful life of capital assets, and/or of nonexpendable personal property, having a useful life of more than one year and a net acquisition cost of more than $5,000 per unit after allocation to FNS as projected for one year after purchase, is allowable when such procurement is specifically approved by FNS. No such approval shall be granted unless the State agency shall demonstrate to FNS that such a cost is:

(a) Necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient administration of the program, and allocable thereto under the principles provided herein; and

(b) That procurement of such item or items has been or will be made in accordance with the standards set out in ยง 277.14. In no case shall such a cost become a program charge against FNS prior to approval in writing by FNS of the procurement and the cost. When assets acquired with SNAP funds are (i) sold, (ii) no longer available for use in a federally sponsored program, or (iii) used for purposes not authorized by FNS, FNS's equity in the asset will be refunded in the same proportion as Federal participation in its cost. In case any assets are traded on new items, only the net cost of the newly acquired assets is allowable.
