###### ยง 4287.107 Routine servicing.

The lender is responsible for servicing the entire loan and for taking all servicing actions that a reasonably prudent lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The lender may contract for services but is ultimately responsible for underwriting, loan origination, loan servicing, and compliance with all Agency regulations. Form RD 4279-4, "Lender's Agreement," is the contractual agreement between the lender and the Agency that sets forth some of the lender's loan servicing responsibilities. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, periodic borrower visits, the collection of payments, obtaining compliance with the covenants and provisions in the loan agreement, obtaining and analyzing financial statements, ensuring payment of taxes and insurance premiums, maintaining liens on collateral, keeping an inventory accounting of all collateral items, and reconciling the inventory of all collateral sold during loan servicing, including liquidation.
