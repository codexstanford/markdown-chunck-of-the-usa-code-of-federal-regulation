####### Applicability.

(a)Intermediaries receiving loans under this program shall be governed by these regulations, the loan agreement, the approved work plan, security interests, and any other conditions which the Agency may impose in making a loan. Whenever this subpart imposes a requirement on loans made from the "IRP revolving loan fund," such requirement shall apply to all loans made by an intermediary to an ultimate recipient from the intermediary's IRP revolving fund for as long as any portion of the intermediary's IRP loan from the Agency remains unpaid. This includes revolved funds. Whenever this subpart imposes a requirement on loans made by intermediaries from "Agency IRP loan funds," without specific reference to the IRP revolving loan fund, such requirement shall apply only to loans made by an intermediary using Agency IRP loan funds and will not apply to loans made from revolved funds.
