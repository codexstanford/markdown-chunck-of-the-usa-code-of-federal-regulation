####### Weighted average life of the loan

means the average life of the loan based on the proportion of original loan principal paid during each year of the loan. It shall be determined by calculating the sum of all loan principal payments, expressed as a fraction of the original loan principal amount, times the number of years and fractions of years elapsed at the time of each payment since issuance of the loan. For example, given a $5 million loan, with a maturity of 5 years and equal principal payments of $1 million due on the anniversary date of the loan, the weighted average life would be: (.2)(1 year) + (.2)(2 years) + (.2)(3 years) + (.2)(4 years) + (.2)(5 years) = .2 years + .4 years + .6 years + .8 years + 1.0 years = 3.0 years. If instead the loan had a balloon payment of $5 million at the end of 5 years, the weighted average life would be: ($5 million/$5 million)(5 years) = 5 years.
