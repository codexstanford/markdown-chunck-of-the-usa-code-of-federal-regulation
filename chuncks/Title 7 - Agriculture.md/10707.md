(d) Yields for determining the product's contribution toward meal pattern requirements must be calculated using the(Program Aid Number 1331).

5. In the event a company uses the CN logo and CN label statement inappropriately, the company will be directed to discontinue the use of the logo and statement and the matter will be referred to the appropriate agency for action to be taken against the company.

6. Products that bear a CN label statement as set forth in paragraph 3(c) carry a warranty. This means that if a food service authority participating in the child nutrition programs purchases a CN labeled product and uses it in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, the school or institution will not have an audit claim filed against it for the CN labeled product for noncompliance with the meal pattern requirements of 7 CFR 210.10, 220.8, 225.21, and 226.20. If a State or Federal auditor finds that a product that is CN labeled does not actually meet the meal pattern requirements claimed on the label, the auditor will report this finding to FNS. FNS will prepare a report of the findings and send it to the appropriate divisions of FSIS and AMS of the USDA, National Marine Fisheries Services of the USDC, Food and Drug Administration, or the Department of Justice for action against the company.

Any or all of the following courses of action may be taken:

(a) The company's CN label may be revoked for a specific period of time;

(b) The appropriate agency may pursue a misbranding or mislabeling action against the company producing the product;

(c) The company's name will be circulated to regional FNS offices;

(d) FNS will require the food service program involved to notify the State agency of the labeling violation.

7. FNS is authorized to issue operational policies, procedures, and instructions for the CN Labeling Program.
