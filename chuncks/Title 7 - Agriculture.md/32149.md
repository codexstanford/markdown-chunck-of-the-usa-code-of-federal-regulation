######## Generic promotion,i.e.,,i.e.,

means a promotion that does not involve the exclusive or predominant use of a single company name, logo, or brand name, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, but rather promotes an eligible commodity generally. A generic promotion activity may include the promotion of a foreign brand (a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market an agricultural commodity in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted eligible commodity from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos, or brand names. However, in that case, the Cooperator must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such eligible commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme (a dominant idea or motif) and style and is subordinate to the promotion of the generic theme.
