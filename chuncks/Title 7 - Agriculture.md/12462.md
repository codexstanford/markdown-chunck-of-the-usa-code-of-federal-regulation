(c)The school food authority should not use donated foods in meals or other activities that do not benefit primarily schoolchildren, such as banquets or catered events. However, as their use in such activities may not always be avoided (if donated foods are commingled with purchased foods in a single inventory management system), the school food authority must ensure reimbursement to the nonprofit school food service for the value of donated foods used in such activities. When such reimbursement may not be based on actual usage of donated foods (in a single inventory management system), the school food authority must establish an alternate method of reimbursement-by including the current per-meal value of donated food assistance in the price charged for the meal or other activity.
