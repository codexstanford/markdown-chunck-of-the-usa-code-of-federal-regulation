######## Net price.

The term "net price" means the total amount paid by a packer to a producer (including all premiums, less all discounts) per hundred pounds of carcass weight of swine delivered at the plant. The total amount paid shall include any sum deducted from the price (per hundredweight) paid to a producer that reflects the repayment of a balance owed by the producer to the packer or the accumulation of a balance to later be repaid by the packer to the producer. The total amount paid shall exclude any sum earlier paid to a producer that must be repaid to the packer.
