###### ยง 1710.400 Purpose.

(a) This subpart establishes policies and requirements that apply to loans and loan guarantees to finance Energy Efficiency and Conservation programs (EE Programs) undertaken by an eligible utility system to finance Demand side management, energy efficiency and conservation, or on-grid and off-grid renewable energy system programs that will result in the better management of their system load growth, a more beneficial load profile, or greater optimization of the use of alternative energy resources in their service territory. These programs may be considered an essential utility service.

(b)(1) The goals of an eligible Energy Efficiency project eligible for funding under this program and Subpart H include:

(i) Increasing energy efficiency at the end user level;

(ii) Modifying electric load such that there is a reduction in overall system demand;

(iii) Effecting a more efficient use of existing electric distribution, transmission and generation facilities;

(iv) Attracting new businesses and creating jobs in rural communities by investing in energy efficiency; and

(v) Encouraging the use of renewable energy fuels for either Demand side management or the reduction of conventional fossil fuel use within the service territory.

(2) Although not a goal, RUS recognizes that there will be a reduction of greenhouse gases with energy efficiency improvements.
