###### ยง 245.6 Application, eligibility and certification of children for free and reduced price meals and free milk.
####### Households that fail to apply.

(d)After the letter to parents and the applications have been disseminated, the local educational agency may determine, based on information available to it, that a child for whom an application has not been submitted meets the local educational agency's eligibility criteria for free and reduced price meals or for free milk. In such a situation, the local educational agency shall complete and file an application for such child setting forth the basis of determining the child's eligibility. When a local educational agency has obtained a determination of individual family income and family-size data from other sources, it need not require the submission of an application for any child from a family whose income would qualify for free or reduced price meals or for free milk under the local educational agency's established criteria. In such event, the School Food Authority shall notify the family that its children are eligible for free or reduced price meals or for free milk. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to provide authority for the local educational agency to make eligibility determinations or certifications by categories or groups of children.
