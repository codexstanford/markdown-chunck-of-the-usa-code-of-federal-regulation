(b)Before accepting produce on consignment, the parties should reach a definite agreement on the amount of the commission and other charges which will be assessed by the commission merchant. In the absence of such an agreement, only the usual and customary commission and other charges shall be permitted. The receiver may not reconsign produce to another person or firm, including auction companies, and incur additional commissions, charges or expenses without the specific prior authority of the consignor. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, joint account partners shall not charge a commission fee or other selling charges against the joint account for disposing of the produce. When a portion of a consigned shipment is purchased by the commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.
