######## Actions not requiring a site-specific EIS.

(1)All proposed actions and their impacts that are determined to be adequately discussed in the program EIS or determined not to be major Federal actions will not require a site-specific EIS. However, if the assessment reveals that these proposed actions will have significant adverse effects on the quality of the human environment, the RFO will:

(i) Modify the action to eliminate or mitigate the significant adverse impacts, or

(ii) Withdraw further Federal assistance if significant adverse impacts cannot be eliminated or mitigated.
