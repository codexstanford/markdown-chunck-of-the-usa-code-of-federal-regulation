######## State Office review.

(g)The State Office must monitor fire and rescue and other small community facility project loanmaking and servicing and provide guidance, assistance, and training as necessary to ensure the activities are accomplished in an orderly manner consistent with the Agency's regulations. The processing office should request advice and assistance from the State Office as needed. The State Director may require all or part of a specific application docket to be submitted to the State Office for review at any time. The State Director may determine that one or more of the processing office staffs do not have adequate training and expertise to routinely complete application dockets without State Office review. In such cases, the State Director should establish guidelines by memorandum or by State supplement to the subpart for the necessary State Office reviews.
