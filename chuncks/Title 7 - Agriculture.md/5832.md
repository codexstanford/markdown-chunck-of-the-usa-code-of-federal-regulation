######## ยง 52.38c Statistical sampling procedures for lot inspection of processed fruits and vegetables by attributes.
######### Lot single sampling plans for processed fruits and vegetables.

(d)(1) Tables XV through XIX contain the lot single sampling plans for each of five different standard sample unit sizes. The plans within each table are listed according to increasing values of Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL's).

(2) AQL values of 10.0 or less may be expressed either in "defects per hundred units" or in "percent defective units." The same sampling plans are used for both. Separate sampling plans must be used for AQL values greater than 10.0.

(3) A separate lot single sampling plan is chosen for each class of defects (or defectives) by first specifying the desired AQL, the appropriate standard sample unit size, and the number of sample units as specified in ยง 52.38c (b) of this subpart. The quality levels associated with the Pa=50% and Pa=10% levels are given in the instructional manual.
