###### ยง 1000.42 Classification of transfers and diversions.
####### Transfers and diversions to a plant regulated under another Federal order.

(b)Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to a plant regulated under another Federal order shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any receipts at the pool plant from a plant regulated under another Federal order of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section:

(1) As Class I milk, if transferred as packaged fluid milk products;

(2) If transferred or diverted in bulk form, classification shall be in the classes to which allocated under the other order:

(i) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of receipts and utilization filed with their respective market administrators, transfers in bulk form shall be classified as other than Class I to the extent that such utilization is available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions of the other order;

(ii) If diverted, the diverting handler must request a classification other than Class I. If the plant receiving the diverted milk does not have sufficient utilization available for the requested classification and some of the diverted milk is consequently assigned to Class I use, the diverting handler shall be given the option of designating the entire load of diverted milk as producer milk at the plant physically receiving the milk. Alternatively, if the diverting handler so chooses, it may designate which dairy farmers whose milk was diverted during the month will be designated as producers under the order physically receiving the milk. If the diverting handler declines to accept either of these options, the market administrator will prorate the portion of diverted milk in excess of Class II, III, and IV use among all the dairy farmers whose milk was received from the diverting handler on the last day of the month, then the second-to-last day, and continuing in that fashion until the excess diverted milk has been assigned as producer milk under the receiving order; and

(iii) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification under this paragraph, classification shall be Class I, subject to adjustment when such information is available.
