(2)Payment for major equipment should generally coincide with delivery of the usable equipment, along with any necessary title or certifications, to the borrower. Borrowers may not use Agency loan funds to make deposits on equipment not ready for delivery. If a borrower purchases a truck chassis from one supplier and another supplier will complete the development of a fire or rescue vehicle, RD may release funds to pay for the chassis when title to the chassis is transferred to the borrower.
