####### Timely action on hearings,Time frames for the State agency.

(2)-(i)The State agency must conduct the hearing, arrive at a decision, and notify the household of the decision within 60 days of receipt of a request for a fair hearing. The fair hearing decision may result in a change in the household's eligibility or the amount of commodities issued to the household based on household size. The State agency must implement these changes to be effective for the next scheduled distribution of commodities following the date of the fair hearing decision. If the commodities are normally made available to the household within a specific period of time (for example, from the first day of the month through the tenth day of the month), the effective date of the disqualification will be the first day of that period.
