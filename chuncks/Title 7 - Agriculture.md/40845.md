####### ยง 1962.4 Definitions.
######## Basic security.

Consists of all equipment serving as security for Rural Development loans. It also consists of real estate and all foundation herds and flocks, including replacements, which serve as a basis for the farming operation outlined in the Farm and Home Plan or yearly budget which serve as security for Rural Development. With respect to livestock herds and flocks, animals that are sold as a result of the normal culling process are basic security unless the borrower has replacements that will keep numbers and production up to planned levels. However, if a borrower plans to make a significant reduction in his basic livestock herd or flocks, the animals or birds that are sold in making this reduction will be considered basic security.
