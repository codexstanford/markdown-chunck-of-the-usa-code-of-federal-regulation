######## Grocery wholesaler

(ii)is a dealer primarily engaged in the full-line wholesale distribution and resale of grocery and related nonfood items (such as perishable agricultural commodities, dry groceries, general merchandise, meat, poultry, and seafood, and health and beauty care items) to retailers. This term does not include persons primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution and resale of perishable agricultural commodities rather than other grocery and related nonfood items. Specifically, for an entity to be considered a grocery wholesaler, 50 percent or more of its annual gross sales must be from the full-line distribution and resale of grocery and related nonfood items, and it cannot have more than 50 percent of its sales in perishable agricultural commodities. "Full line" means that an entity must be supplying the retailer with a wide range of products such as the grocery and related nonfood items specified.
