(f)As a loan approval requirement, some borrowers may have special agreements with members of the purchase of shares of stock or for payment of a pro rata share of the loan in the event of default, or they may have authority in their corporate instruments to make special assessments in that event. Such agreements may be referred to as individual liability agreements and may be assigned to and held by Rural Development as additional security. In other cases the borrower's note may be endorsed by individuals. The liability instruments will be serviced in a manner indicated by their contents and the advice of OGC to adequately protect Rural Development's interest. Servicing actions necessary due to such provisions will be tracked in the Multi-Family Housing Information System (MFIS).
