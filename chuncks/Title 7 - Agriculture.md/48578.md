####### Lender's liquidation plan.

(c)Within 30 calendar days after the lender decides to liquidate a loan, the lender must submit a written, proposed plan of liquidation to the Agency for approval. The liquidation plan must be detailed and include at least the following information:

(1) Such proof as the Agency requires to establish the lender's ownership of the guaranteed loan promissory note and related security instruments;

(2) A copy of the payment ledger, if available, or other documentation that reflects the current outstanding loan balance, accrued interest to date, and the method of computing the accrued interest;

(3) A full and complete list of all collateral and a listing of all liens held and status of such liens, plus any personal and corporate guarantees;

(4) The recommended liquidation methods for making the maximum collection possible on the indebtedness and the justification for such methods, including recommended action for acquiring and disposing of all collateral and collecting from guarantors;

(5) Necessary steps for preservation of the collateral including any anticipated protective advances;

(6) The market value and the potential liquidation value, or estimates thereof, of all the collateral securing the loan.

(i) These values or estimates of the collateral must be obtained by the lender through an independent appraisal. If the outstanding balance of principal and interest is less than $250,000, the lender may, instead of an appraisal, obtain these values or estimates by using their primary regulator's policies relating to appraisals and evaluations or, if the lender is not regulated, normal banking practices and generally accepted methods of determining value.

(ii) The procedure used to obtain these values or estimates of the collateral must include an evaluation of the impact of any release of hazardous substances, petroleum products, or other environmental hazards.

(iii) Any independent appraiser's fee, including the cost of the environmental site assessment if necessary, will be shared equally by the Agency and the lender;

(7) Proposed protective bid amounts on collateral to be sold at auction and a description to show how the amounts were determined.

(i) A protective bid can be made by the lender, with prior Agency written approval, at a foreclosure sale to protect the lender's and the Agency's interest.

(ii) The protective bid must not exceed the amount of the loan balance plus applicable foreclosure expenses and must be based on the liquidation value and estimated net recovery considering prior liens and outstanding taxes, expenses of foreclosure, and estimated expenses for holding and reselling the property. Foreclosure expenses include, but are not limited to, expenses for resale, interest accrual, length of time necessary for resale, maintenance, guard service, weatherization, and prior liens;

(8) Copies of the borrower's latest available financial statements;

(9) Copies of each guarantor's latest available financial statements;

(10) An itemized list of estimated liquidation expenses expected to be incurred along with justification for each expense;

(11) Estimated protective advance amounts with justification;

(12) If a voluntary conveyance is considered, the proposed amount to be credited to the guaranteed debt;

(13) Legal opinions, if needed by the lender's legal counsel; and

(14) A schedule to periodically report to the Agency on the progress of liquidation, not to exceed every 60 days.
