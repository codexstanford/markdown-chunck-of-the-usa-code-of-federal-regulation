(a)The standard interest rate on an insured loan made on or after November 1, 1993, is the municipal rate, which is the rate determined by the Administrator to be equal to the current market yield on outstanding municipal obligations with remaining periods to maturity, up to 35 years, similar to the interest rate term selected by the borrower. In certain cases, an interest rate cap of 7 percent may apply. The interest rate term and rollover maturity date for a municipal rate loan will be determined pursuant to 7 CFR part 1714, and the borrower may elect to include in the loan documents a prepayment option (call provision).
