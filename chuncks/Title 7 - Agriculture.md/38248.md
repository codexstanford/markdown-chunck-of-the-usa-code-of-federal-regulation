When Rural Development loan or grant funds and those of any other lender or grantor have all been properly expended or withdrawn, Form RD 402-6 may be used to give Rural Development's consent (and of another lender or grantor, if involved) to close the supervised bank account in the following situations:

(a) When Rural Development loan funds in the supervised bank account of a borrower have been reduced to $100 or less, and a check for the unexpended balance has been issued to the borrower to be used for authorized purposes.

(b) For all loan accounts, after completion of authorized loan funds expenditures, and after promptly refunding any remaining unexpended loan funds on the borrower's loan account with Rural Development or another lender, as appropriate.

(c) Promptly upon death of a borrower, except when the loan is being continued with a joint debtor, when a borrower is in default and it is determined that no further assistance will be given, or when a borrower is no longer classified as "active."
