###### ยง 4280.311 Loan provisions for Agency loans to microlenders.
####### Combining accounts and reports.

(3)If a microlender has more than one loan from the Agency, a separate report must be made for each loan except when RMRF accounts have been combined. A microlender may combine RMRF accounts only when the Agency approves the combining of accounts and reports in writing before such accounts are combined and reports are submitted, and:

(i) The underlying loans have the same rates, terms and conditions, including the method of determining matching funds for a microborrower's project; and

(ii) The combined report allows the Agency to effectively administer the program, including providing the same level of transparency and information for each loan as if separate RMRF and LLRF reports had been prepared.
