######## Priorities,Truly rural areas.

(c)-(1)Rural Development program assistance will be directed toward truly rural areas and rural communities. Normally, priority will not be given to preapplications for projects that will serve other than truly rural areas. Truly rural areas are areas other than densely settled areas or communities adjacent to, or closely associated with, a city or town with a population exceeding 10,000 residents for water or waste disposal assistance, or 20,000 residents for essential community facility assistance. When determining whether a rural area or rural community is adjacent to, or closely associated with, a city or town with a population exceeding 10,000 residents for water and waste disposal, or 20,000 residents for essential community facility assistance, minor open spaces such as those created by physical or legal barriers, commercial or industrial development, parks, areas reserved for convenience or appearance, or narrow strips of cultivated land, will be disregarded. An area or community shall be considered adjacent to or closely related with a nonrural area when it constitutes for general, social, and economic purposes a single community having a contiguous boundary.
