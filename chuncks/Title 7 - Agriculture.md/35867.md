The information may enter the system in either analog or digital form and may or may not be converted to analog at the exit port depending on the facility beyond. The switching system shall operate properly as an integral part of the telephone network when connected to physical and carrier derived circuits meeting RUS specifications and other generally accepted telecommunications practices.

(2) The output of a digital-to-digital port shall be Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), encoded in eight-bit words using the mu-255 encoding law and D3 encoding format, and arranged to interface with a T1 span line.
