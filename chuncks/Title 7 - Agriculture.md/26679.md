####### Advanced pricing factors.

(q)For the purpose of computing the Class I skim milk price, the Class II skim milk price, the Class II nonfat solids price, and the Class I butterfat price for the following month, the following pricing factors shall be computed using the weighted average of the 2 most recent NASS U.S. average weekly survey prices announced before the 24th day of the month:

(1) An advanced Class III skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

(i) Following the procedure set forth in paragraphs (n) and (o) of this section, but using the weighted average of the 2 most recent NASS U.S. average weekly survey prices announced before the 24th day of the month, compute a protein price and an other solids price;

(ii) Multiply the protein price computed in paragraph (q)(1)(i) of this section by 3.1;

(iii) Multiply the other solids price per pound computed in paragraph (q)(1)(i) of this section by 5.9; and

(iv) Add the amounts computed in paragraphs (q)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

(2) An advanced Class IV skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

(i) Following the procedure set forth in paragraph (m) of this section, but using the weighted average of the 2 most recent NASS U.S. average weekly survey prices announced before the 24th day of the month, compute a nonfat solids price; and

(ii) Multiply the nonfat solids price computed in paragraph (q)(2)(i) of this section by 9.

(3) An advanced butterfat price per pound rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be calculated by computing a weighted average of the 2 most recent U.S. average NASS AA Butter survey prices announced before the 24th day of the month, subtracting 17.15 cents from this average, and multiplying the result by 1.211.
