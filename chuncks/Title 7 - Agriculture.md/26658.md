(iii) Plus .5 percent of the quantity of milk diverted by the plant operator to another plant on a basis other than farm weights and tests; and

(iv) Minus 1.5 percent of the quantity of bulk milk transferred to other plants, excluding concentrated milk transferred by agreement for other than Class I use.
