######## Child Care Center

302-2.4-Where feasible, a child care center may be included to provide supervised activity and safety for children while the parents work. Supervisors and workers for such centers are sometimes enlisted on a volunteer basis and the cost borne by nonprofit associations or community organizations. Grants are sometimes available through Federal or state programs. Consequently, the design of the child care center should meet the requirements of those sources providing organizational personnel and/or financing.
