####### Acceleration.

(f)The lender must proceed to accelerate the loan as expeditiously as possible when acceleration is necessary, including giving any notices and taking any other required legal actions. The guaranteed loan will be considered in liquidation once it has been accelerated and a demand for payment has been made upon the borrower.

(1) If the sole basis for acceleration is a non-monetary default, the lender must obtain concurrence from the Agency prior to accelerating the loan. In the case of monetary default, the lender may accelerate the loan without prior approval by the Agency, although Agency concurrence must still be given no later than the time the Agency approves the liquidation plan.

(2) The Lender must provide the Agency a copy of the acceleration notice or other acceleration document sent to the borrower.
