##### ยง 1755.405 Voiceband data transmission measurements.
###### Signal-to-C notched noise (S/CNN) measurement.

(b)(1) When specified by the borrower, S/CNN measurements shall be made on trunk circuits and nonloaded subscriber loops. For trunk circuits, the measurement shall be made between CO locations. For nonloaded subscriber loops, the measurement shall be made from the CO to the station protector of the NID at the customer's access location.

(2) S/CNN is the logarithmic ratio expressed in dB of a 1,004 Hz holding tone signal compared to the C-message weighted noise level. S/CNN is one of the most important transmission parameters affecting the performance of data transmission because proper modem operation requires low noise relative to received power level. Since modulated carriers are used in data communication systems, noise measurements need to be performed with power on the connection to activate equipment having signal-level-dependent noise sources. For 4 kHz channels, a 1,004 Hz holding tone is used to activate the signal-dependent equipment on the channel or connection.
