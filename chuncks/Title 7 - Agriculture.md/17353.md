###### § 400.454 Disqualification and civil fines.

(a) Before any disqualification or civil fine is imposed, FCIC will provide the affected participants and other persons with notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with 7 CFR part 1, subpart H.

(1) Proceedings will be initiated when the Manager of FCIC files a complaint with the Hearing Clerk, United States Department of Agriculture.

(ii) With respect to a settlement agreement with FCIC, the date contained in the settlement agreement or, if no date is specified, the date that such agreement is executed by FCIC.

(3) Disqualification and civil fines may only be imposed if a preponderance of the evidence shows that the participant or other person has met the standards contained in § 400.454(b). FCIC has the burden of proving that the standards in § 400.454(b) have been met.

(4) Disqualification and civil fines may be imposed regardless of whether FCIC or the approved insurance provider has suffered any monetary losses. However, if there is no monetary loss, disqualification will only be imposed if the violation is material in accordance with § 400.454(c).

(b) Disqualification and civil fines may be imposed on any participant or person who willfully and intentionally:

(1) Provides any false or inaccurate information to FCIC or to any approved insurance provider with respect to a policy or plan of insurance authorized under the Act either through action or omission to act when there is knowledge that false or inaccurate information is or will be provided; or

(2) Fails to comply with a requirement of FCIC.

(c) When imposing any disqualification or civil fine:

(i) Whether to disqualify a participant or other person;

(ii) The amount of time that a participant or other person should be disqualified;

(iii) Whether to impose a civil fine; and

(iv) The amount of a civil fine that should be imposed.

(2) The gravity of the violation includes consideration of whether the violation was material and if it was material:

(i) The number or frequency of incidents or duration of the violation;

(ii) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of violation;

(iii) Whether and to what extent the person planned, initiated, or carried out the violation;

(iv) Whether the person has accepted responsibility for the violation and recognizes the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for disqualification or civil fine;

(v) Whether the person has paid all civil and administrative liabilities for the violation;

(vi) Whether the person has cooperated fully with FCIC (In determining the extent of cooperation, FCIC may consider when the cooperation began and whether the person disclosed all pertinent information known to that person at the time);

(vii) Whether the violation was pervasive within the organization;

(viii) The kind of positions held by the persons involved in the violation;

(ix) Whether the organization took prompt, appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence;

(x) Whether the principals of the organization tolerated the offense;

(xi) Whether the person brought the violation to the attention of FCIC in a timely manner;

(xii) Whether the organization had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the violation occurred;

(xiii) Whether the organization has taken appropriate disciplinary action against the persons responsible for the violation;

(xiv) Whether the organization had adequate time to eliminate the violation that led to the cause for disqualification or civil fine;

(xv) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.

(3) The maximum term of disqualification and civil fines will be imposed against:

(i) Participants and other persons, except insurance providers who:

(A) Commit multiple violations in the same crop year or over several crop years; or

(B) Commit a single violation but such violation results in an overpayment of more than $100,000;

(ii) Approved insurance providers who:

(A) Commit a single violation resulting in an overpayment in excess of $100,000; and

(B) Commit multiple acts of violations resulting in an overpayment in excess of $500,000; and

(iii) Any participant or person who commits such other action or omission of so serious a nature that imposition of the maximum is appropriate.

(d) With respect to the imputing of conduct:

(1) The conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to that organization when such conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the violation is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

(2) The conduct of any organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, knows, or had reason to know of such conduct.

(3) The conduct of one organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to another organization when such conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

(4) If such conduct is imputed, the person to whom the conduct is imputed to may be subject to the same disqualification and civil fines as the person from whom the conduct is imputed. The factors contained in § 400.454(c)(2) will be taken into consideration with respect to the person to whom the conduct is being imputed.
