####### ยง 1924.5 Planning development work.
######## Time of starting development work.

(i)Development work will be started as soon as feasible after the loan is closed. Except in cases in which advance commitments are made in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550 or according to ยง 1924.13(e)(1)(vi)(A) or ยง 1924.13(e)(2)(ix)(A) of this subpart, no commitments with respect to performing planned development will be made by the Agency or the applicant before the loan is closed. The applicant will be instructed that before the loan is closed, debts should not be incurred for labor or materials, or expenditures made for such purposes, with the expectation of being reimbursed from funds except as provided in subpart A of part 1943 of this chapter, 7 CFR part 3550, and subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. However, with the prior approval of the National Office, a State Supplement may be issued authorizing County Supervisors to permit applicants to commence welldrilling operations prior to loan closing, provided:

(1) It is necessary in the area to provide the water supply prior to loan closing,

(2) The applicant agrees in writing to pay with personal funds all costs incurred if a satisfactory water supply is not obtained,

(3) Any contractors and suppliers understand and agree that loan funds may not be available to make the payment,

(4) Such action will not result under applicable State law in the giving of priority to mechanics and materialmen's liens over the later recorded Agency mortgage, and

(5) The Agency does not guarantee that the cost will be paid.
