######## Performance standards.

(a)The distributing agency must meet the basic performance standards included in this paragraph (a) in the ordering, distribution, processing, if applicable, and control of donated foods. Some of the performance standards apply only to distributing agencies that distribute donated foods in NSLP or other child nutrition programs, as indicated. However, the identification of specific performance standards does not diminish the responsibility of the distributing agency to meet other requirements in this part. In meeting basic performance standards, the distributing agency must:

(1) Provide recipient agencies with information on donated food availability, assistance levels, values, product specifications, and processing options, as requested;

(2) Implement a request-driven ordering system, in accordance with ยง 250.10(a), and, for child nutrition programs, ยง 250.58(a);

(3) Offer school food authorities in NSLP, at a minimum, the commodity offer value of donated foods, in accordance with ยง 250.58;

(4) Provide for the storage, distribution, and control of donated foods in accordance with all Federal, State, or local requirements relating to food safety and health;

(5) Provide for the distribution of donated foods in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, including, to the extent practical, direct shipments from vendors to recipient agencies or processors, and the use of split shipments;

(6) Use SAE funds, or other Federal or State funds, as available, in paying State storage and distribution costs for child nutrition programs, and impose a distribution charge on recipient agencies in child nutrition programs only to the extent that such funds are insufficient to meet applicable costs;

(7) Provide for the processing of donated foods, at the request of school food authorities, in accordance with subpart C of this part, including the testing of end products with school food authorities, and the solicitation of acceptability input, when procuring end products on behalf of school food authorities or otherwise limiting the procurement of end products; and

(8) Provide recipient agencies information regarding the preferred method for submission of donated foods complaints to the distributing agency and act expeditiously to resolve submitted complaints.
