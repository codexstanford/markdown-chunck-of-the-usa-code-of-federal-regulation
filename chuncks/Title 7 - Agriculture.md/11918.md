####### What happens if a participant improperly receives or uses CSFP benefits through fraud?

(c)The State agency must ensure that a local agency initiates a claim against a participant to recover the value of CSFP commodities improperly received or used if the local agency determines that the participant or caretaker of the participant fraudulently received or used the commodities. For purposes of this program, fraud includes intentionally making false or misleading statements, or intentionally withholding information, to obtain CSFP commodities, or the selling or exchange of CSFP commodities for non-food items. The local agency must advise the participant of the opportunity to appeal the claim through the fair hearing process, in accordance with ยง 247.33(a). The local agency must also disqualify the participant from CSFP for a period of up to one year, unless the local agency determines that disqualification would result in a serious health risk, in accordance with the requirements of ยง 247.20(b).
