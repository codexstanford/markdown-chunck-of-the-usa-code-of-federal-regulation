####### Acquiring property titles.

(9)If a lender acquires title to property, any loss will be based on the collateral value at the time the lender obtains title. Alternatively, the lender can calculate the final loss settlement using the net proceeds received at the time of the ultimate disposition of the property if-

(i) The lender has submitted to the Agency a written request to use this option within 15 calendar days of acquiring title; and

(ii) The Agency approves the request prior to the lender submitting any request for estimated loss payment.
