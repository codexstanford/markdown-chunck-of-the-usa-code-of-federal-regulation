####### § 1962.40 Liquidation.
######## Involuntary liquidation,General.

(b)-(1)When a borrower makes an unapproved disposition of security, the directions in §§ 1962.18 and 1962.49 of this subpart will be followed. In all other cases, when the County Supervisor, with the advice of the District Director, determines that continued servicing of the loan will not accomplish the objectives of the loan, or that further servicing cannot be justified under the policy stated in § 1962.2 of this subpart, liquidation of the account(s) will be accomplished as quickly as possible under this section and subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter. When liquidation is begun, it is the agency policy to liquidate all security and EO property, except EO property that the County Supervisor determines is essential for minimum family living needs. The present market value of security that may be retained by the borrower for minimum family living needs will not exceed $600. However, only so much of the security and EO property will be liquidated as necessary to pay the indebtedness.
