######## Summary suspension.

(ii)The Service may, without first affording the agency (hereafter referred to in this paragraph as the "respondent") an opportunity for a hearing, suspend a designation or refuse to reinstate a designation when the suspension period has expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the designation and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official inspection and weighing system. A suspension or refusal to reinstate a suspended designation shall be effective upon the respondent's receipt of a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate the action if it finds that alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the respondent.
