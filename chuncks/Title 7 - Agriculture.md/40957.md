######## Bankruptcy is dismissed after a confirmed reorganization plan.

(3)If a bankruptcy is dismissed after a reorganization plan was confirmed, the account will be serviced as follows:

(i) If the borrower has substantially complied with the plan, but later defaults for reasons beyond the borrower's control, (see 7 CFR 1951.909(c)), the borrower will be notified of loan servicing in accordance with 7 CFR 1951.907. No notices will be sent if the account was previously accelerated; such action is inconsistent with the provisions of the confirmed bankruptcy plan or the Bankruptcy Code; or the case has been referred to the Department of Justice.

(ii) If the borrower failed to make one full payment under the plan, or did not comply with the plan for reasons not beyond the borrower's control, the borrower will be serviced according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
