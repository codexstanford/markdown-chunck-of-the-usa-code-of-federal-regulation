######## Account activity statements.

(2)Generally, Rural Development will not monitor or reconcile the reserve account activity statements issued periodically by the financial institutions holding the funds. Rural Development will monitor reserve account levels through budget reports, audits, and Agency reserve tracking systems. If disputes arise or the borrower is in violation of Agency regulations, the Agency may require account activity statements. When account activity statements are sought, it will normally be sufficient to obtain the statement which reflects balances as of the last activity statement ending period. Form RD 402-2 is not required to be used.
