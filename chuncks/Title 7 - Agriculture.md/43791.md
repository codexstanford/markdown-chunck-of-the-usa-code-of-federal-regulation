####### Interest credit.

A payment subsidy available to certain eligible section 502 borrowers that reduces the effective interest rate of a loan (see 3550.68(d)). Borrowers receiving interest credit will continue to receive it on all current and future loans for as long as they remain eligible for and continue to receive a subsidy. Borrowers who cease to be eligible for interest credit can never receive interest credit again, but may receive payment assistance if they again qualify for a payment subsidy.
