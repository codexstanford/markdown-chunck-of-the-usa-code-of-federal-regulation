###### ยง 1499.15 Noncompliance with an agreement.

If a recipient fails to comply with a Federal statute or regulation or the terms and conditions of the agreement, and CCC determines that the noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, CCC may take one or more of the actions set forth in 2 CFR 200.339 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the recipient. CCC may also initiate a claim against a recipient if the donated commodities are damaged or lost, or the sale proceeds, goods received through barter, CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income are misused or lost, due to an action or omission of the recipient.
