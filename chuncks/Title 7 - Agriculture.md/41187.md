######## Changes in terms and conditions in Form RD 449-14.

(c)It is the intent of Rural Development that once the Form RD 449-14 is issued and accepted by the lender, the commitment is not to be modified as to the scope of the project, overall facility concept, project purpose, use of proceeds or terms and conditions. Should changes be requested by the lender, the State Director will negotiate with the lender and proposed borrower any proposed changes to the originally accepted Form RD 449-14. If, as a result of these negotiations, the lender, proposed borrower or State Director presents alternate conditions which would result in a change in the scope of the project, and if the loan exceeds the State Director's loan approval authority, the State Director will submit these changes in the conditions by memorandum to the National Office for consideration with a copy of the revised Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14 and any amendments thereto. Changes to the conditional commitment may be approved by the State Director for loans within their loan approval authority.
