(a)The Deputy Administrator will list as a regulated area each State or portion of a State in which golden nematode has been determined to be found or in which there is reason to believe that golden nematode is present, or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities.

(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and

(2) The designation of less than an entire State as a regulated area will be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of golden nematodes.
