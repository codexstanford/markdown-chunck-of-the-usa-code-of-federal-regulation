(b)See ยง 1940.552(b) of this subpart.

(1) The criteria used in the basic formula are:

(i) State's percentage of national rural population-50 percent.

(ii) State's percentage of national rural population with incomes below the poverty level-25 percent.

(iii) State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment-25 percent.

(2) The data source for the first criterion is the most recent decennial Census data. The data source for the second criterion is the 5-year data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. The data source for the third criterion is the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a State factor (SF). The SF cannot exceed 0.05.

SF = (criterion (b)(1)(i) x 50 percent) + (criterion (b)(1)(ii) x 25 percent) + (criterion (b)(1)(iii) x 25 percent)
