####### ยง 4280.112 Applicant eligibility.
######## End Users.

(c)If the controlling interest in the applicant entity is otherwise eligible and a legal transaction between two parties for the sale of energy in an open market is being proposed, the Agency will not consider the energy end-users as part of the analysis of the eligibility of the applicant. If the proposed end-user would be an ineligible applicant, such as an entity which is residential in nature or a non-profit entity, and the REAP applicant entity is a newly formed special-purpose entity with substantially the same ownership as the sole proposed end-user, then the REAP applicant entity is not eligible.
