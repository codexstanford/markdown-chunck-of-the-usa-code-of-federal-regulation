####### General.

(a)To prevent or correct a compliance violation or to prevent or cure a default in a situation that cannot be resolved through regular servicing, the Agency may approve a deferral of loan payments or a loan restructuring. Nothing herein precludes the Agency from initiating appropriate legal action to correct a compliance violation if the Agency determines such action is more in the Government's interest than entering into a special servicing agreement as provided for in this section. Procedures for debt collection are discussed in ยง 3560.460. As part of a workout agreement, the Agency may agree to accept less than full monthly payment installments due on an Agency loan for a specified period of time, not to exceed the effective period of the workout agreement.
