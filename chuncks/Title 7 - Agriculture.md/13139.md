####### Program funds.

(1)(i) For program funds, State agencies shall request prior approvals promptly from FNS for budget revisions whenever:

(A) The revision indicates the need for additional Federal funding;

(B) The program budget exceeds $100,000, and the cumulative amount of transfers among program functions exceeds or is expected to exceed five percent of the program budget. The same criteria apply to the cumulative amount of transfers among functions and activities when budgeted separately for program funds provided to a subagency, except that FNS shall permit no transfer which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part thereof, to be used for purposes other than those intended;

(C) The revisions involve the transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs; or

(D) The revisions pertain to the addition of items requiring prior approval by FNS in accordance with the provisions of the applicable cost principles specified 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415.

(ii) No other changes to the Program fund budget require approval from FNS. Examples of changes which do not require Federal approval are: The use of State agency funds to accomplish program objectives over and above the State agency minimum share included in the approved Program budget; and the transfer of amounts budgeted for direct costs to absorb authorized increases in indirect costs.

(iii) The requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section may be waived by FNS provided that:

(A) No different limitation or approval requirement may be imposed; and,

(B) FNS shall not permit a transfer which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part, thereof, to be used for purpose other than those intended.
