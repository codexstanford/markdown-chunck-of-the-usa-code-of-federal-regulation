######## In general.

A.Drought and Disaster (D&D) guaranteed loans are authorized by section 331 ("Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises") of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, which provides for guarantees of up to 90 percent of the unpaid principal amount of qualifying loans. Interest and protective advances are not covered by the guarantee. Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans may be either to assist in alleviating financial distress caused to rural business entities, directly or indirectly, by drought, hail, excessive moisture, or related conditions occurring in 1988, or to assist such entities that refinance or restructure debt as a result of losses incurred, directly or indirectly, because of such natural disasters. Where used in this appendix, the term "natural disaster(s)" refers only to drought, hail, excessive moisture, and related conditions occurring in 1988. All provisions of Subparts A and E of Part 1980 of this chapter apply to D&D loans, except as provided in this appendix. All forms used in connection with a D&D loan will be those used in connection with a B&I guaranteed loan, except for the following three forms that are incorporated in this Appendix I of this Subpart E, made a part hereof:

(1) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-68, "Lender's Agreement-Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans," or successor form will be used instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-35, "Lender's Agreement."

(2) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-69, "Loan Note Guarantee-Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans," or successor form will be used instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-34, "Loan Note Guarantee."

(3) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-70, "Assignment Guarantee Agreement-Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans," or successor form will be used instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-36, "Assignment Guarantee Agreement."
