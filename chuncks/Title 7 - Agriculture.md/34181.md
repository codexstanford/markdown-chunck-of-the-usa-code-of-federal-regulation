####### Deferments for contributions-in-aid of construction.

(e)(1) A Borrower may request RUS to defer principal payments to enable the Borrower to make funds available to new full time residential consumers to assist them in paying their share of the construction costs (contribution-in-aid of construction) needed to connect them to the Borrower's system.

(2) Amounts available for this purpose will be limited to the amount of the construction costs that are in excess of the average cost per residential consumer incurred by the Borrower to connect new full time residential consumers during the last calendar year for which data are available. The average cost per residential consumer is the total cost incurred by the Borrower and will not be reduced by the amounts received as a contribution-in-aid of construction.
