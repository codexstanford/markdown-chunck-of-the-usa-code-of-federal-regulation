####### General.

(a)In the event a lender fails or ceases to service a guaranteed loan, the Agency will make the successor lending entity aware of the statutory and regulatory requirements and will provide instruction to the successor lending entity on a case-by-case basis. Such instructions may include the Agency's determination that the Agency will service the entire loan or the guaranteed portion of the loan.

(1) Any successor lender must take such action that a reasonable lender would take if it did not have a loan note guarantee to protect the lender and Agency's mutual interest.

(2) A successor entity approved by the Agency as a lender will be afforded the benefits of the loan note guarantee in the sharing of any loss and eligible expenses subject to the limits that are set forth in the regulations governing the loan guarantee.
