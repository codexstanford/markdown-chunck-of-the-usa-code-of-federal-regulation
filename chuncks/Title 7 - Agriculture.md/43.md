##### ยง 1.10 Authentication under Departmental Seal and certification of records.
###### In general.

(a)Requests seeking either authenticated or certified copies of records will generally be processed under the FOIA. FOIA search, review, and duplication fees, where applicable, may also apply. However, because the costs for authenticated and certified copies are outside of the FOIA, the provisions of ยง 1.12 that call for the automatic waiver of FOIA fees under $25.00 do not apply.
