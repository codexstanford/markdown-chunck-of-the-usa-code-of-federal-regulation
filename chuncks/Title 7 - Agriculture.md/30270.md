######## Calling a loan

is accelerating or moving forward the maturity date of an outstanding MAL. A MAL can be called when, as determined by CCC, the terms and conditions of the MAL note and security agreement are violated, a producer incorrectly certifies a loan quantity or makes any fraudulent representation with respect to obtaining a loan, removing or disposing of a farm-stored commodity pledged as collateral for a loan without authorization, to protect CCC's interest, or in emergency situations.
