####### ยง 610.14 Use of USLE, RUSLE, and WEQ.

(a) All Highly Erodible Land (HEL) determinations are based on the formulas set forth in 7 CFR ยง 12.21 using some of the factors from the USLE and WEQ and the factor values that were contained in the local Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) as of January 1, 1990. In addition, this includes the soil loss tolerance values used in those formulas for determining HEL. The soil loss tolerance value is used as one of the criteria for planning soil conservation systems. These values are available in the FOTG in the local field office of the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

(b) RUSLE will be used to:

(1)(i) Evaluate the soil loss estimates of conservation systems contained in the FOTG.
