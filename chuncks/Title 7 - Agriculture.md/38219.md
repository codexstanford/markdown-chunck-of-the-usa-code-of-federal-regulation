(d)Certain insurance endorsements contain a clause or rider providing for a replacement note when the original note is paid in full, or is called by Rural Development. This provision applies to loans sold for a fixed period of 10 years or longer for loans sold on or after December 1, 1969, and a fixed period of 15 years or longer for loans sold before December 1, 1969. If a note is paid in full or called by the Government and the lender is entitled to a replacement note, the lender may obtain a certificate of beneficial ownership in lieu of the replacement note. The certificate will carry the rates and terms applicable to the replacement note.
