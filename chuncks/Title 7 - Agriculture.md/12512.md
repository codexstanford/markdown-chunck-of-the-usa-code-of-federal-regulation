####### Agreements between State agencies and eligible recipient agencies, and between eligible recipient agencies.

(2)Prior to making donated foods or administrative funds available, State agencies must enter into a written agreement with eligible recipient agencies to which they plan to distribute donated foods and/or administrative funds. State agencies must ensure that eligible recipient agencies in turn enter into a written agreement with any eligible recipient agencies to which they plan to distribute donated foods and/or administrative funds before donated foods or administrative funds are transferred between any two eligible recipient agencies. All agreements entered into must contain the information specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and be considered permanent, with amendments to be made as necessary, except that agreements must specify that they may be terminated by either party upon 30 days' written notice. State agencies must ensure that eligible recipient agencies provide, on a timely basis, by amendment to the agreement, or other written documents incorporated into the agreement by reference if permitted under paragraph (d) of this section, any information on changes in program administration, including any changes resulting from amendments to Federal regulations or policy.
