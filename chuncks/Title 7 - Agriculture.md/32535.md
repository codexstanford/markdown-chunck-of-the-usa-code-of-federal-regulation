####### e.g.,,e.g.,

(D) If an eligible traveler is the target of a market development activity (a foreign buyer, foreign importer, member of the foreign media) the ATP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate when the eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds five hours. In such case, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.

(iii) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances noted in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C) and (d) of this section, the CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses.

(iv) A stopover for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2) is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another.

(v) All travel under this paragraph (c)(2) should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel. An eligible traveler that is the target of a market development activity is only eligible for a rest period when that traveler flies in economy class and meets the 14-hour test;

(3) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status;

(4) Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200;

(5) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third-party participants for ATP activities or for ATP-funded travel of third-party participants;

(6) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market;

(7) Legal fees incurred in resolving trade issues with foreign countries;

(8) The sample purchase price, and the cost of transporting samples domestically in the United States to the port of export and then to the first foreign port or first point of entry, for samples of U.S. agricultural commodities used to provide on-site technical assistance to the trade necessary to facilitate successful use of the relevant U.S. agricultural commodity by importers. The target of such activity must be the trade, and not consumers, but any product resulting from the technical training can be used to determine consumer preferences;

(9) STRE incurred outside of the United States and STRE incurred within the United States in conjunction with an approved activity where the STRE has a programmatic purpose and are authorized with prior written approval from the CCC. ATP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and receptions incurred outside of the United States as the basis for their calculating eligible expenses. ATP Participants may exceed Embassy guidelines by 25 percent without prior approval. ATP Participants may only exceed 125 percent of Embassy guidelines when they have received written authorization from the FAS Agricultural Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed 125 percent of the guidelines will not be reimbursed. ATP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines and these regulations. For STRE incurred in the United States, the ATP Participant should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses;

(10) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses, incurred specifically to administer the ATP, for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the SRTGs, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council. The level of such funding will be established in the approval letter.

(11) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses, incurred specifically to administer the ATP, for any ATP Participants not identified in this paragraph (c)(11), will be considered, except for agricultural cooperatives. Reimbursement for such expenses shall not exceed six percent of the ATP Participant's total ATP budget. The level of such funding will be established in the approval letter.

(13) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States;

(14) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for international retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows conducted in the United States upon prior written approval by CCC. Domestic travel expenses to such a show or exhibit are covered only if the exhibit or show is: A food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the host country. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which ATP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to ATP Participants via an ATP notice issued on FAS' website;

(15) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for seminars and educational training conducted in the United States;

(16) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for up to two individuals, whether home office ATP Participant employees, ATP Participant board members, or state department of agriculture employees paid by the ATP Participant, or a combination thereof, when such individuals accompany foreign trade missions or technical teams while traveling in the United States where the following conditions are met:

(B) Include a discernible "link" to the FAS website or an FAS overseas office website; and

(C) Have been specifically approved by the appropriate FAS division. Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable.

(ii) Reimbursement claims for websites that include "members only" sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access; and

(22) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending non-tariff barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities. Examples of such expenditures include, but are not limited to: Initial pre-clearance programs, educational training, policy advocacy, public relations efforts, foreign country audits of U.S. facilities, export protocol and work plan support, seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest lists, pest and disease research, database development, and reasonable logistical and administrative support.
