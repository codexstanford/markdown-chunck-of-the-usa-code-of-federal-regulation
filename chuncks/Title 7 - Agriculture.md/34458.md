###### National and other standards.

(a)RUS will utilize standards of national standardizing groups, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Wood Preservers' Association (AWPA), the various national engineering societies and the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), to the greatest extent practical. When there are no national standards or when RUS determines that the existing national standards are not adequate for rural electric systems, RUS will prepare standards for material and equipment to be used on systems of electric borrowers. RUS standards and specifications will be codified or listed in ยง 1728.97, Incorporation by Reference of Electric Standards and Specifications. RUS will also prepare specifications for materials and equipment when it determines that such specifications will result in reduced costs, improved materials and equipment, or in the more effective use of engineering services.
