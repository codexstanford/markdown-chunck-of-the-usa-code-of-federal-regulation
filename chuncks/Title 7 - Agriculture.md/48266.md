The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program is administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund with NMTC credits allocated to Treasury-certified Community Development Entities (CDEs) across the United States to make Qualified Equity Investments (QEIs) in low-income communities. NMTC related definitions and terms in this section are governed by section 45(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 45D), and applicable Treasury regulations (26 CFR 1.45D-1). A CDE will generally establish a new subsidiary of a CDE (sub-CDE) for individual NMTC projects. Lenders and their borrowers with guaranteed loan Projects that include NMTC investments must comply with the provisions in this section. To be a lender for a guaranteed loan project that involves financing under the NMTC provisions, the lending entity must meet the applicable eligibility criteria in ยง 5001.130. The Agency will not waive its servicing rights to a guaranteed loan or be a party to any forbearance agreement in conjunction with a NMTC project.
