(1) The specific criteria to be used in determining eligibility for free milk. These criteria shall give consideration to economic need as reflected by family size and income.

(2) The method by which the child-care institution will collect information from families in order to determine a child's eligibility for free milk.

(3) The method by which the child-care institution will collect milk payments so as to prevent the overt identification of children receiving free milk.

(4) A hearing procedure substantially like that outlined in part 245 of this chapter.

(5) An assurance that there will be no discrimination against free milk recipients and no discrimination against any child on the basis of race, color, or national origin.
