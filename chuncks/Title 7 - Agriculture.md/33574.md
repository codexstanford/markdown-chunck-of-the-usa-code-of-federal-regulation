####### Allocation of funds under this section.

The Administrator may, but is not limited to, consider the following factors in making this determination:

(1) The overall availability of funding compared to anticipated loan demand;

(2) The best interests of rural consumers;

(3) The protection of the Government's financial interest in existing loans and collateral; and
