####### ยง 301.81-11 Imported fire ant detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program for nurseries producing containerized plants.
######## Detection.

(a)(1) Nursery owners are required to visually survey their entire premises twice monthly for the presence of imported fire ants.

(2) Nurseries participating in this program will be inspected by Federal or State inspectors at least twice per year. More frequent inspections may be necessary depending upon imported fire ant infestation levels immediately surrounding the nursery, the thoroughness of nursery management in maintaining imported-fire-ant-free premises, and the number of previous detections of imported fire ants in or near containerized plants. Inspections by Federal and State inspectors should be more frequent just before and during the peak shipping season. Any nurseries determined during nursery inspections to have imported fire ant colonies must be immediately treated to the extent necessary to eliminate the colonies.
