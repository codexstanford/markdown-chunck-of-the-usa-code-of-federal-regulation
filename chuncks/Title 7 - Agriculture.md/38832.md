######## Basic formula criteria, data source and weight.

(b)See ยง 1940.552(b) of this subpart. The criteria used in the basic formula are:

(1) State's percentage of the National number of rural occupied substandard units,

(2) State's percentage of the National rural population 62 years and older, and

(3) State's percentage of the National number of rural households below 50 percent of area median income. The data source for the first two of these criteria is the most recent decennial Census data. The data source for the third criterion is the 5-year data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a basic State factor (SF).

SF = (criterion No. 1 x weight of 33 1/3%) + (criterion No. 2 x weight of 33 1/3%) + (criterion No. 3 x weight of 33 1/3%)
