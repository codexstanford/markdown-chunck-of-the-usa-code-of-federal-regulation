####### Lower scoring projects.

(b)(1) In cases when preliminary cost estimates indicate that an eligible, high-scoring application is not feasible, or would require grant assistance exceeding 50 percent of a State's current annual allocation, or an amount greater than that remaining in the State's allocation, the approval official may instead select the next lower-scoring application for further processing provided the high-scoring applicant is notified of this action and given an opportunity to review the proposal and resubmit it prior to selection of the next application.

(2) If it is found that there is no effective way to reduce costs, the approval official, after consultation with the applicant, may request an additional allocation of funds from the National office.
