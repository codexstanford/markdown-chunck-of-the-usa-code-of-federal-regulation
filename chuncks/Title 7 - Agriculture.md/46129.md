######## Availability of budgetary authority.

(2)The Agency will consider the size of the request relative to the budgetary authority that remains available to the Program during the fiscal year.

(i) If there is insufficient budgetary authority during a particular funding period to select a higher scoring application, the Agency may elect to select the next highest scoring application for further processing. Before this occurs, the Agency will provide the Borrower of the higher scoring application the opportunity to reduce the amount of its request to the amount of budgetary authority available. If the Borrower agrees to lower its request, it must certify that the purposes of the Project can be met, and the Agency must determine the Project is financially feasible at the lower amount.

(ii) If the amount of funding required is greater than 25 percent of the Program's outstanding budgetary authority, the Agency may elect to select the next highest scoring application for further processing, provided the higher scoring Borrower is notified of this action and given an opportunity to revise their application and resubmit it for an amount less than or equal to 25 percent of the Program's outstanding budgetary authority.
