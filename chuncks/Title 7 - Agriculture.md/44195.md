(2) The development is administered by a homeowners association that owns and is obligated to maintain property and improvements within the development (for example, greenbelts, recreation facilities and parking areas) for the common use and benefit of the unit owners; and

(3) The unit owners have an automatic, non-severable interest in the homeowners association and pay mandatory assessments.
