######### Sale of vacant land.

(3)When Rural Development has vacant land in inventory which was security for an SFH loan, the land will be sold in accordance with this subparagraph. When the lot meets the requirements of 7 CFR part 3550, and a program applicant desires to purchase the lot and construct a dwelling, a credit sale will not be made. Instead, one section 502 loan will be made which will include funds for the purchase of the lot and construction of a dwelling. Otherwise, the lot will be sold for cash or on NP terms with a loan not to exceed ten years in term and amortization.
