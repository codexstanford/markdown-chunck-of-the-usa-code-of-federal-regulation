###### Water blocking material.

(i)(1) Sufficient flooding compound or water blocking elements must be applied between the inner jacket and armor and between the armor and outer jacket so that voids and air spaces in these areas are minimized. The use of flooding compound or water blocking elements between the armor and outer jacket is not required when uniform bonding, paragraph (o)(9) of this section, is achieved between the plastic-clad armor and the outer jacket.

The aged jacket must retain a minimum of 85% of its un-aged tensile strength and elongation values when tested per paragraph 7.19.2.3. The flooding compound must exhibit adhesive properties sufficient to prevent jacket slip when tested per paragraph 7.30.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 and meets paragraph 7.30.2 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 for minimum sheath adherence of 14 N/mm for armored cables.
