###### ยง 5001.507 Lender transfer.
####### e.g.,

(c) The Agency will not pay any loss or share in any costs (legal fees, appraisal fees and environmental assessments) for a voluntary transfer of lender. This includes situations where a lender is merged with or acquired by another lender and situations where the lender has failed and been taken over by a Federal regulatory agency such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the loan is subsequently sold to another lender. However, in situations where the lender has failed and been taken over by a Federal regulator and the loan is liquidated rather than being sold to another lender, the Agency will pay losses and share in costs as if the Federal regulatory agency were an approved new lender.

(d) In cases when there is a transfer to a new lender or when a lender has been merged with or acquired by another Lender, the Agency and the new lender must execute a new lender's agreement, unless the new lender already has a valid lender's agreement with the Agency.

(e) After Agency approval of a transfer of lender, all terms of the original loan note guarantee shall transfer to the benefit of the new lender.
