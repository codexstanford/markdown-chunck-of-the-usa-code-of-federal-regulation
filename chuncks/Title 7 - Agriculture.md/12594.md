###### ยง 252.1 Purpose and scope.
####### Purpose.

(a)This part provides a program whereby the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and private processors of food may enter into agreements under which the processor will process and distribute designated donated food to eligible recipient agencies. The intent of the program is to encourage private industry, acting in cooperation with the States and FNS, to develop new markets in which donated food may be utilized. It is expected that the processors will use their marketing abilities to encourage eligible recipient agencies to participate in the program. Additionally, recipient agencies will benefit by being able to purchase processed end products at a substantially reduced price.
