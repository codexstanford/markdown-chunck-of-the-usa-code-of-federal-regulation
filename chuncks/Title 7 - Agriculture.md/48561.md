####### Reductions.

(b)The borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively initiate a permanent or temporary reduction in the interest rate of the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan upon written agreement among these parties. After a permanent reduction, the loan note guarantee will only cover losses of interest at the reduced interest rate.

(1) When the Agency is a holder, the lender must obtain Agency approval before implementing the reduction. The lender must provide a copy of the modification agreement to the Agency for approval. The Agency will approve the reduction only when it is demonstrated that the change is more viable than liquidation and that the government's financial interests are not adversely affected.

(2) Factors that the Agency will consider in determining whether to approve the change are the Government's cost of borrowing money; the monetary recovery is greater than the liquidation recovery; and the project's continued viability as demonstrated by a financial feasibility analysis.
