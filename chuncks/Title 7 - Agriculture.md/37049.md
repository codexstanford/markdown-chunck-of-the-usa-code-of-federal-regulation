####### General.

(a)(1) Each loan will bear interest at the rate prescribed in RD Instruction 440.1, exhibit B. The interest rates will be set by the Agency for each quarter of the fiscal year. All rates will be adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one per centum. The rate will be the lower of the rate in effect at the time of loan approval or the rate in effect at the time of loan closing unless the applicant otherwise chooses.

(2) If the interest rate is to be that in effect at loan closing on a loan involving multiple advances of RUS funds using temporary debt instruments, the interest rate charged shall be that in effect on the date when the first temporary debt instrument is issued.

(3) For a loan for a specific project that has been approved, but not closed on or before May 22, 2008, the rate structure in effect at that time will determine the interest rates. For loans approved on or after May 23, 2008, a percentage of the market rate will be used to determine the poverty and intermediate interest rates.
