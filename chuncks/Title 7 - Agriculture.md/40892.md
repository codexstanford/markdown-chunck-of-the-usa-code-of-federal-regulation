(c)Financing statements will be terminated by use of Form RD or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 462-12 if provided by a State supplement. (1) Under UCC provisions if Rural Development fails to give a termination statement to the borrower within 10 days after written demand, it will be liable to the borrower for $100 and, in addition, for any loss caused to the borrower by such failure unless otherwise provided by a State supplement. In the absence of demand for a termination statement by the borrower, a termination statement will be delivered to the borrower when the notes have been paid in full.

(2) However, if Rural Development has been meeting the borrower's annual operating credit needs in the past and expects to do so the next year, the financing statements need not be terminated in the absence of such demand unless a loan for the succeeding year will not be made or earlier termination is required by a State supplement.
