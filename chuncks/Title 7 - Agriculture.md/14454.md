####### General.

(a)Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services rendered during the period of performance in the administration of the program including but not necessarily limited to wages, salaries, and supplementary compensation and benefits as defined in section A.(13) of these principles. The costs of such compensation are allowable to the extent that total compensation for individual employees: is reasonable for the services rendered; follows an appointment made in accordance with State or local government laws and rules and which meets Federal Merit System or other requirements, where applicable; and is determined and supported as provided in section A of these principles. Compensation for employees engaged in federally assisted activities will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the State or local government. In cases where the kinds of employees required for SNAP activities are not found in the other activities of the State or local government, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the employing government competes for the kind of employees involved. Compensation surveys providing data representative of the labor market involved will be an acceptable basis for evaluating reasonableness.
