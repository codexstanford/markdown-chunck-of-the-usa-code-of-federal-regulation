####### Farmland

(a)means prime or unique farmlands as defined in section 1540(c)(1) of the Act or farmland that is determined by the appropriate state or unit of local government agency or agencies with concurrence of the Secretary to be farmland of statewide of local importance. "Farmland" does not include land already in or committed to urban development or water storage. Farmland "already in" urban development or water storage includes all such land with a density of 30 structures per 40-acre area. Farmland already in urban development also includes lands identified as "urbanized area" (UA) on the Census Bureau Map, or as urban area mapped with a "tint overprint" on the USGS topographical maps, or as "urban-built-up" on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not "farmland" and, therefore, are not subject to the Act. Farmland "committed to urban development or water storage" includes all such land that receives a combined score of 160 points or less from the land evaluation and site assessment criteria.
