######## Double sampling.

A sampling scheme which involves use of two independently drawn but related samples, a first sample and a second sample which is added to the first to form a total sample size. A double sampling plan consists of first and total sample sizes with associated acceptance and rejection criteria. The first sample must be inspected first, and if possible, a decision as to acceptance or rejection of the lot made before a second sample is inspected. When the decision cannot be made on the first sample, a second sample is inspected; the decision to accept or reject is based on the total sample size.
