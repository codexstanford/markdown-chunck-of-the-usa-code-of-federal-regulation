######## Credit memo

means a commercial document, also known as a credit memorandum, issued by the Cooperator to a commercial entity that owes the Cooperator a certain sum. A credit memo is used when the Cooperator owes the commercial entity a sum less than the amount the entity owes the Cooperator. The credit memo reflects an offset of the amount the Cooperator owes the entity against the amount the entity owes to the Cooperator.
