####### "Application for Funding (Form NIFA-661)".

(1)All preproposals submitted by eligible applicants should contain an "Application for Funding", Form NIFA-661, which must be signed by the proposing principal investigator(s) and endorsed by the cognizant authorized organizational representative who possesses the necessary authority to commit the applicant's time and other relevant resources. The title of the proposal must be brief (80-character maximum), yet represent the major thrust of the project. Because this title will be used to provide information to those who may not be familiar with the proposed project, highly technical words or phraseology should be avoided where possible. In addition, phrases such as "investigation of" and "research on" should not be used.
