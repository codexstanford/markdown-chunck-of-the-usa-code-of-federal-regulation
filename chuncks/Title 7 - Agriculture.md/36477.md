###### Lifting hardware requirements.

(vi)The lifting hardware on housings and their contents that weigh more than 91 kg (200 lb) shall be tested. The housing shall be fastened to a restraining device such as a concrete slab and subjected to loading through the lifting attachments to simulate the lifting load. For the first test a lifting line equipped with a dynamometer shall be attached to the housing lifting hardware and a load applied equal to three times the weight of a fully equipped housing. Deformation or damage to the housing or lifting hardware constitutes failure. A second test shall be conducted with the same arrangements as for the first except that a load shall be applied equal to six times the weight of a fully equipped housing. There shall be no catastrophic failure of the lifting hardware or housing.
