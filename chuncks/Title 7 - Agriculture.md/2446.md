###### Will there be a pre-hearing conference?

(b)The ALJ may hold a pre-hearing conference. If such a conference is to be held, the notice of the pre-hearing conference also will contain a notice to the parties of a time and date for the pre-hearing conference. Pre-hearing conferences normally will be held by telephone. Issues that may be addressed at the pre-hearing conference may include: simplification of the issues; the possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of the authenticity of documents; limitation of the number of witnesses; exchange of copies of hearing exhibits; negotiation, compromise or settlement of issues; identification of documents of which official notice will be requested; a schedule for completion of the actions decided upon at the conference; and any other matters that may aid and expedite the conclusion of the proceeding. No transcript of the pre-hearing conference will be made but the ALJ will issue a written memorandum summarizing the results of the pre-hearing conference.
