####### Rights and liabilities.

(b)When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a holder, the holder will succeed to all rights of the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The full, legal interest in the note must remain with the lender, and the lender will remain bound to all obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee, Lender's Agreement, and Agency program regulations. A guarantee and right to require purchase will be directly enforceable by a holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation by the lender or any unenforceability of the guarantee by the lender, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time it became the holder or in which the holder participates in or condones. The lender will reimburse the Agency for any payments the Agency makes to a holder on the lender's guaranteed loan that, under the Loan Note Guarantee, would not have been paid to the lender had the lender retained the entire interest in the guaranteed loan and not conveyed an interest to a holder.
