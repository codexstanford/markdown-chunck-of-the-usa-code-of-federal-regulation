##### ยง 1755.403 Copper cable telecommunications plant measurements.
###### Return loss balanced to artificial line.

(ii)The step-by-step measurement procedure using the return loss balanced to artificial line for loaded loops shall be as shown in Figure 9. An artificial line of the same makeup as the cable to be tested shall be set up. The artificial line is connected to the external network terminals of the test set. The cable pair under test is compared to this standard. When defects are found, they should be identified and located by introducing faults into the artificial line. This is more difficult than with the method referenced in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section since this measurement is more sensitive to minor faults and only a single trace is used.
