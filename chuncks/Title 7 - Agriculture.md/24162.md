####### Random row diversion.

(1)Using the orchard map furnished by the grower, the Board will randomly select rows of trees within the orchard to be diverted. The amount of cherries to be diverted will be based on the preliminary restricted percentage amount established pursuant to ยง 930.50. A grower may elect a different percentage amount; however, the grower needs to inform the Board as soon as possible after the preliminary percentages are announced of this other amount, but in no event shall this be less than seven days in advance of harvest. The designated rows indicated by the map must not be harvested. After completing harvest of the remaining rows in the orchard, the grower must notify the Board and/or the Board's compliance officer. A compliance officer will then be allowed to observe the grower's orchard to assure that the selected rows have not been harvested. The grower must inform the Board of the total production of the orchard to calculate the tonnage that was diverted.
