######## Expiration records and notices.

(2)(i) In cases other than those involving FP or section 502 RH borrowers, the County Supervisor will notify the borrower of the expiration of his insurance at least 30 days in advance of such expiration unless he has received written evidence that the insurance has been renewed.

(ii) FP and Section 502 RH borrowers will be informed during the tenth month after the date of loan closing of their responsibility to carry insurance. Form RD 426-4 will be sent to these borrowers, regardless of whether there is evidence that the insurance has been renewed. Thereafter, the County Supervisor will not be required to further determine whether the borrower has adequately maintained insurance; however, if a further notice of expiration is received in the County Office, the County Supervisor will again notify the borrower by using RD 426-4 of his responsibility.
