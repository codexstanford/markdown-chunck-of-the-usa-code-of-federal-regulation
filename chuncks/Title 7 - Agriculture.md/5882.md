######### Method for ascertaining drained weight.

(3)The drained weight of canned red tart pitted cherries is determined by emptying the contents of the container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8 circular sieve of proper diameter containing eight meshes to the inch (0.0937 inch (2.3 mm), +/-3 percent, square openings) so as to distribute the product evenly over the sieve. Without shifting the product, incline the sieve at an angle of 17&#xB0; to 20&#xB0; to facilitate drainage and allow to drain for two minutes. The weight of drained cherries is the weight of the sieve and product less the weight of the dry sieve. A sieve eight inches in diameter is used for No. 3 size containers (404 x 414) and smaller, and a sieve 12 inches in diameter is used for containers larger than No. 3 size containers.
