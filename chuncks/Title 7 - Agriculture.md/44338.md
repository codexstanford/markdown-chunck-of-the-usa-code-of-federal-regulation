####### Plan and responsibility of lender to ensure payment.

(2)Lenders that do not have the capacity to escrow funds must implement procedures, subject to Agency approval, to ensure the borrower pays such obligations on a timely basis. In addition, such lenders must accept the responsibility for payment of taxes and insurance that comes due prior to liquidation. Rural Development will not include any taxes or insurance amounts that accrued prior to acceleration in any potential loss claim. Rural Development may revoke the acceptance of the lender's plan if loan performance indicates that delinquency and loss rates are being affected by the lender's inability to escrow for taxes, assessment, and insurance. This alternative is not available to lenders who contract for servicing.
