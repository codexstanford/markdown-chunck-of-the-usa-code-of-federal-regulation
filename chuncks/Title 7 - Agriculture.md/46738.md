####### Credit elsewhere test.

(d)Microborrowers will be subject to a "credit elsewhere" test so that the microlender will make loans only to those borrowers that cannot obtain business funding of $50,000 or less at affordable rates and on acceptable repayment terms. Each microborrower file must contain evidence that the microborrower has sought credit elsewhere or that the rates and terms available within the community at the time were outside the range of the microborrower's affordability. Evidence may include a comparison of rates, loan limitations, terms, or other requirements from other funding sources. Denial letters from other lenders are not required.
