###### Amplitude jitter (AJ) measurement.

(e)(1) When specified by the borrower, AJ measurements shall be made on trunk circuits and nonloaded subscriber loops. For trunk circuits, the measurement shall be made between CO locations. For nonloaded subscriber loops, the measurement shall be made from the CO to the station protector of the NID at the customer's access location.

(2) AJ is any fluctuation in the peak amplitude value of a fixed tone signal at 1,004 Hz from its nominal value. AJ is expressed in peak percent amplitude modulation.

(3) AJ is measured in two separate frequency bands, 4-300 Hz and 20-300 Hz. The 4-300 Hz band is important for modems employing echo canceling capabilities. The 20-300 Hz band is used for modems that do not employ echo cancelers.

(4) Amplitude modulation can affect the error performance of voiceband data modems. The measurement of amplitude jitter indicates the total effect on the amplitude of the holding tone of incidental amplitude modulation and other sources including quantizing and message noise, impulse noise, gain hits, phase jitter, and additive tones such as single-frequency interference.
