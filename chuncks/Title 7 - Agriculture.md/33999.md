####### Borrower's obligations to other creditors.

(d)The Administrator will not grant relief on debt owed to the government unless similar relief, on a pro rata basis, is granted with respect to other secured obligations of the borrower, or the other secured creditors provide other benefits or value to the debt restructuring. Unsecured creditors will also be expected to contribute to the restructuring. If it is not possible to obtain the expected contributions from other creditors, the Administrator may proceed to settle a borrower's debt if that will maximize recovery by the government and will not result in material benefits accruing to other creditors at the expense of the government.
