(l)In all litigation proceedings involving the Borrower, the Lender is responsible for protecting the rights of the Lender with respect to the loan and keeping the Agency adequately and regularly informed, in writing, of all aspects of the proceedings. If the Agency determines that the Lender is not adequately protecting the rights of the Lender or the Agency with respect to the loan, the Agency reserves the right to take any legal action the Agency determines necessary to protect the rights of the Lender, on behalf of the Lender, or the Agency with respect to the loan. If the Agency exercises this right, the Lender must cooperate with the Agency. Any cost to the Agency associated with such action will be assessed against the Lender.
