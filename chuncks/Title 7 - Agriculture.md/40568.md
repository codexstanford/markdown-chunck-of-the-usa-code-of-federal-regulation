(c)If an organization wants to buy a property which does not meet DSS standards, Rural Development will repair it to meet those standards, including thermal performance standards, unless Rural Development determines it is not feasible to do so according to ยง 1955.64(a)(1)(ii) of subpart B of part 1955 of this chapter. The price will be adjusted to reflect any resulting change in value. Cosmetic repairs, if needed, such as painting, floor covering, landscaping, etc., are the responsibility of the organization. Form RD 1955-44, itemizing the required repairs and Rural Developments agreement to complete them before closing will be made a part of Form RD 1955-45, the sales contract, before it is signed. Required repairs must be completed before closing so DSS restrictions will not be required in the deed.
