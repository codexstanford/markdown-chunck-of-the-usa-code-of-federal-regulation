### PART 17 - SALES OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MADE AVAILABLE UNDER TITLE I OF THE AGRICULTURAL TRADE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1954, AS AMENDED
#### ยง 17.6 Discounts, fees, commissions and payments.
##### Selling agents.

(b)(1) A supplier may not make a payment to a selling agent employed or engaged by the supplier to obtain a contract. This prohibition applies to any payment to a person who has acted as a selling agent to obtain a contract even though the payment may be for services performed that are not themselves services to obtain a contract.

(2) A person is deemed to act "to obtain a contract" if the person acts on behalf of a commodity supplier to:

(i) Influence a buyer to award a contract to the supplier;

(ii) Give the supplier a competitive advantage in relation to other potential suppliers; or

(iii) Influence CCC to approve a contract for financing under this part.

(3) CCC will not consider acts which are purely ministerial in nature and do not require the exercise of personal influence, judgment, or discretion (such as attending bid openings or presenting offers at bid openings), or services to implement a contract after it has been entered into by the parties (such as handling documentation problems or contract disputes), as acts to obtain a contract.
