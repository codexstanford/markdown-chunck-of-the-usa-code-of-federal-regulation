###### ยง 1489.15 Operational procedures for brand programs.
####### e.g.,

(6) Require that all product labels, promotional material, and advertising will identify the origin of the U.S. agricultural commodity as "American", "Product of the United States of America", "Product of the U.S.", "Product of the U.S.A.", "Product of America", "Grown in the United States of America", "Grown in the U.S.", "Grown in the U.S.A.", "Grown in America", "Made in the United States of America," "Made in the U.S.", "Made in the U.S.A.", "Made in America", or product of, grown in or made in any state or territory of the United States of America spelled out in its entirety, or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance by the CCC; that such origin identification will be conspicuously displayed in a manner easily observed as identifying the origin of the product; and that such origin identification will conform, to the extent possible, to the U.S. standard ofinch (.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter "o". The use of the above terms as a descriptor or in the name of the product (Cincinnati style chili, Gina's American Pizza) does not satisfy the product origin requirement. Phrases "product of", "grown in" or "made in" are encouraged, but not required. An ATP Participant may request an exemption from this requirement on a case-by-case basis. All such requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory to the CCC that this labeling requirement would hinder an ATP Participant's promotional efforts. CCC will determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification exists to grant an exemption from the labeling requirement. In addition, the CCC may temporarily waive this requirement where the CCC has determined that such labeling will likely harm sales rather than help them. Such determinations will be announced to ATP Participants via an ATP notice issued on the FAS website;

(7) Include a written certification by the brand participant that identifies its size on the date of its application for branded program funding or that it is a U.S. agricultural cooperative;

(8) Require that the brand participant submit to the ATP Participant a statement certifying that any Federal funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or third party funds or other contributions to program activities; and

(9) Require the brand participant to maintain all original records and documents relating to program activities for three calendar years following the end of the applicable program period and make such records and documents available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
