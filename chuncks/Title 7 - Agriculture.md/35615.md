###### Traffic and Plant Registers.

(2)Traffic measurements consist of three types-peg count, usage, and congestion. A peg count register scores one count per call attempt per circuit group such as trunks, digit receivers, senders, etc. Usage counters measure the traffic density in networks, trunks and other circuit groups. Congestion registers score the number of calls which fail to find an idle circuit in a trunk group or to find an idle path through the switching network when attempting to connect two given end points. These conditions constitute "network blocking."

(3) When required, traffic data will be stored in electronic storage registers or a block of memory consisting of one or more traffic counters for each item to be measured. The bidder shall indicate what registers are to be supplied, their purpose and the means for displaying the information locally (or at a remote location when available).
