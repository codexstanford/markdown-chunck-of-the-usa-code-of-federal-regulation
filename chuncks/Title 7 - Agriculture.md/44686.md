####### Physical maintenance.

(a)(1) The purposes of physical maintenance are the following:

(i) Provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and

(ii) Maintain the security of the property.

(2) Borrowers are responsible for the long-term, cost-effective preservation of the housing project.

(3) At all times, borrowers must maintain housing projects in compliance with local, state and federal laws and regulations and according to the following Agency requirements for affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Agency design requirements are discussed in ยง 3560.60. The Agency acknowledges that property maintenance is an ongoing process and will not penalize borrowers for less than 100 percent compliance as long as it is evident that the borrower is striving to achieve the standards listed in this paragraph. In addition, the Agency understands that although its multifamily housing portfolio is relatively homogeneous, no one standard is appropriate for all properties.
