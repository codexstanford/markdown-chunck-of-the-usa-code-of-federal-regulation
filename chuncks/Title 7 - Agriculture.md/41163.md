######## Minimum requirements.

(d)This section sets out minimum requirements for audited and unaudited financial statements to be submitted to the Agency. If specific circumstances warrant, the Agency may require audited financial statements or independent unaudited financial statements in excess of the minimum requirements. For example, loans that depend heavily on inventory and accounts receivable for collateral will normally be audited, regardless of the size of the loan. Nothing in this section shall be considered an impediment to the lender requiring financial statements more frequently than required by the Agency or requiring audited financial statements when the Agency would accept unaudited financial statements.
