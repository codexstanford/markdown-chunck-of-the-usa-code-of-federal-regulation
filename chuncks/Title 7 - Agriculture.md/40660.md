(b)The highest complying bid meeting the minimum established price will be accepted by the approval official; however, it will be subject to loan approval by the appropriate official when a credit sale is involved. For SFH and FP (surplus property) sales, preference will be given to a cash offer on NP or surplus property sales which is at least ____*____ percent of the highest offer requiring credit [*Refer to Exhibit B of RD Instruction 440.1 (available in any Rural Development office) for the current percentage.] Otherwise, equal bids will be accepted by public lot drawing. For program or suitable property sales, no preference will be given to program purchasers unless two identical high bids are received, in which case the bid from the program purchaser will receive preference. If a bid is received from any purchaser with a request for credit that (considering any deposit) exceeds the market value of the property or requests a term which exceeds the period for which the property will serve as adequate security, the bidder will be given the opportunity to reduce the credit request and/or term withaccompanying change in the offered price.
