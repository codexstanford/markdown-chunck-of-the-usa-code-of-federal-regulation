(f)The dealer-contractor must sign a construction contract, as specified in 7 CFR 1924.6 which will cover both the unit and site development work. The use of multi-contracts is prohibited. A dealer-contractor may use subcontractors if the dealer-contractor is solely responsible for all work under the contract. Payment for all work will be in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A, except no payment will be made for materials or property stored on site (e.g., payment for a unit will be made only after it is permanently attached to the foundation).
