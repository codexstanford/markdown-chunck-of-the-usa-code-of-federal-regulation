###### ยง 3560.574 Operating assistance.

Operating assistance may be used in lieu of tenant-specific rental assistance in off-farm labor housing projects financed under section 514 or section 516(i) of the Housing Act of 1949 (U.S.C. 1486(i)) that serve migrant farmworkers. Owners of eligible projects may choose tenant-specific rental assistance as described in ยง 3560.573 or operating assistance, or a combination of both, however, any tenant or unit assisted under this section may not receive rental assistance under ยง 3560.572. The objective of this program is to provide assistance toward the cost of operating the project so that rents may be set at rates that are affordable to very low and low-income migrant farmworkers.
