(b)The standards contained in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415 do not relieve the State agency of any contractual responsibilities under its contract. The State agency is the responsible authority, without recourse to FNS, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in connection with the Program. This includes, but is not limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, claims, or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of law are to be referred to the local, State or Federal authority that has proper jurisdiction.
