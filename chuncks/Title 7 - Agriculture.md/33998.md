####### Debt settlement measures.

(c)(1) If the Administrator determines that debt settlement is appropriate, the debt settlement measures the Administrator will consider under this subpart with respect to direct, insured, or guaranteed loans include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Reamortization of debt;

(ii) Extension of debt maturity, provided that the maturity of the borrower's outstanding debt after settlement shall not extend more than 10 years beyond the latest maturity date prior to settlement;

(iii) Reduction of the interest rate charged on the borrower's debt, provided that the interest rate on any portion of the restructured debt shall not be reduced to less than 5 percent, unless the Administrator determines that reducing the rate below 5 percent would maximize debt recovery by the government;

(iv) Forgiveness of interest accrued, penalties, and costs incurred by the government to collect the debt; and

(v) With the concurrence of the Under Secretary for Rural Development, forgiveness of loan principal.

(2) In the event that RUS has, under section 306 of the RE Act, guaranteed loans made by the Federal Financing Bank or other third parties, the Administrator may restructure the borrower's obligations by: acquiring and restructuring the guaranteed loan; restructuring the loan guarantee obligation; restructuring the borrower's reimbursement obligations; or by such means as the Administrator deems appropriate, subject to such consents and approvals, if any, that may be required by the third party lender.
