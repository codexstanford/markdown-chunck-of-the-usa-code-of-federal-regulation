######## Off-site procurements.

(f)Circumstances may require off-site procurement action(s) to be taken by Rural Development to protect custodial, security or inventory property from damage or destruction and/or protect the Government's investment in the property. Such procurements may include, but are not limited to construction or reconstruction of roads, sewers, drainage work or utility lines. This type work may be accomplished either through Rural Development procurement or cooperative agreement.

Funding will come from the appropriate insurance fund.
