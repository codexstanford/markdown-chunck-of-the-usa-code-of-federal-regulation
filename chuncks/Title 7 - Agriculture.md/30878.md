######## Raw value,i.e.,

of any quantity of sugar means its equivalent in terms of raw sugar testing 96 sugar degrees, as determined by a polarimetric test performed under procedures recognized by the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA). Direct-consumption sugar derived from sugar beets and testing 92 or more sugar degrees by the polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value by multiplying the actual number of pounds of such sugar by 1.07. Sugar derived from sugarcane and testing 92 sugar degrees or more by the polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value in the following manner: raw value = {[(actual degree of polarization - 92) x 0.0175] + 0.93} x actual weight. For sugar testing less than 92 sugar degrees by the polariscope, derive raw value by dividing the number of pounds of the "total sugar content" (the sum of the sucrose and invert sugars) thereof by 0.972.
