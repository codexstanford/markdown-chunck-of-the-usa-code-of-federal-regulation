(i.e. The dollar weighted average interest rate on the private loan shall be less than or equal to the dollar weighted average interest rate on the FFB loan being prepaid, so that:

(2) Principal payments on the private loan shall be made either quarterly, semiannually, or annually and shall commence on or before the last day of the calendar year during which the prepayment pursuant to this subpart was made.

(3) With the approval of the Administrator, the lender may refund the private loan with the proceeds of another loan from the same lender, with the existing guarantee and under terms, conditions, and a structure substantially similar to the private loan, on such dates as the lender, the borrower and RUS may agree, provided however, that such a refunding loan shall comply with the provisions of § 1786.28(c) hereof. Additionally, with the approval of the Administrator, the private loan may be prepaid either in whole or in part at any time by the borrower using its general funds.

(4) The private loan and the guaranteed note evidencing the private loan shall not be directly or indirectly part of a transaction the income of which is excluded from gross income for the purposes of Chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(i) With the written approval of the Administrator;

(iii) As an undivided pro rata interest in a pool of obligations.

(6) The loan documentation shall provide RUS with the right to accelerate the note evidencing the private loan upon the occurrence of any "Event of Default" under the mortgage with the effect that all of the unpaid principal and interest on any such note shall become immediately due and payable to RUS, and RUS shall continue to pay under its guarantee the principal of and interest on such note without taking into account such acceleration. The loan documentation shall also provide RUS with a right, upon the occurrence of such an "Event of Default," to accelerate payment on its guarantee and accelerate payment on the note evidencing the private loan on the earlier of any date the interest rate on the private loan is reset, without premium or penalty; any date the borrower may prepay in accordance with the terms of the private loan, or the tenth anniversary of the date the private loan first bears interest at a fixed interest rate.

(7) The principal of the private loan shall not include amounts attributable to fees associated with the private loan. At the time it submits its application, a borrower may request that the Administrator approve the inclusion of amounts attributable to fees as part of the interest rate on the private loan, if the net effective interest rate including such fees meets the test contained in § 1786.28(c)(1). For the purposes of these regulations, such financed fees shall be considered "interest".

(8) Private loans and guaranteed notes evidencing private loans shall otherwise be in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator.
