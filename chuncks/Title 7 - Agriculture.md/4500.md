######## Investigations and disposition of informal complaints.

(b)(1) Upon receipt of all the information and supporting evidence submitted by the person filing the informal complaint, the Deputy Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made as, in the Deputy Administrator's opinion, is justified by the facts. If such investigation discloses that no violation of the Act has occurred, no further action shall be taken and the person filing the informal complaint shall be so informed.

(2) If the statements in the informal complaint and the investigation thereunder seem to warrant such action, and, in any case except one of wilfullness or one in which public health, interest or safety otherwise requires, which may result in the suspension or revocation of a license, the Deputy Administrator, in an effort to effect an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter, shall give written notice to the person complained against of the facts or conduct concerning which complaint is made, and shall afford such person an opportunity, within a reasonable time fixed by the Deputy Administrator, to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the applicable requirements of the Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
