###### System clock.

(j)(1) The central office clock and network synchronization system shall have the ability to be synchronized with external clocks for network synchronization, including detection of slips, timing, jitter and wander, in a digital-to-digital environment or operate initially in an independent network (refer to Bellcore document SR-TSV-002275, BOC Notes on the LEC Networks-1990, section 11).

(2) The end office central office system clock shall be a Stratum 3 clock with:

(i) A minimum long-term accuracy of +/-4.6 x 10(+/-7 Hz @ 1.544 MHz);

(ii) A minimum stability of 3.7 x 10/day upon loss of all frequency references; and

(iii) A "Pull-In Range" for the capability of synchronizing to a clock with accuracy of +/-4.6 x 10.

(3) The access tandem central office system clock shall be a Stratum 2 clock with:

(i) A minimum long-term accuracy of +/-1.6 x 10(+/-0.025 Hz @ 1.544 MHz);

(ii) A minimum stability of 1 x 10/day upon loss of all frequency references; and

(iii) A "Pull-In Range" for the capability of synchronization to a clock with accuracy of +/-1.6 x 10.
