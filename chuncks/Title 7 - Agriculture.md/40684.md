######## Ineligible terms.

Credit terms, for other than SFH or MFH property sales, offered for the convenience of the Government to facilitate sales; more stringent than terms offered under Rural Development's loan programs. Applicable when the purchaser does not meet program eligibility requirements or when the property is classified as surplus. Loans made on ineligible terms are classified as Nonprogram (NP) loans and are serviced accordingly. For SFH and MFH properties, see the definition of "Nonprogram (NP) terms."
