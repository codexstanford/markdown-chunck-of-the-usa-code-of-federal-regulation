####### Effectively diminishing.

An eradication program is considered to be effectively diminishing the gypsy moth population of an area if the results of two successive annual Federal or State delimiting trapping surveys of the area conducted in accordance with Section II, "Survey Procedures-Gypsy Moth," of the Gypsy Moth Treatment Manual show that the average number of gypsy moths caught per trap in the second delimiting survey (when comparable geographical areas and trapping densities are used) is: (1) Less than 10, and (2) less than the average number of gypsy moths caught per trap in the first survey.
