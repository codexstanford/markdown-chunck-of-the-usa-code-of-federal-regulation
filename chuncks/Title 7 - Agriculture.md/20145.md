######## Reasonable rates and terms

are those commercial rates and terms that other farmers are expected to meet when borrowing from a commercial lender or private source for a similar purpose and similar period of time. The "similar period of time" of available commercial loans will be measured against, but need not be the same as, the remaining or original term of the loan.
