(b)The formal notification of an adverse determination will contain a statement of the awardee's appeal rights.

The awardee's request to NIFA for review must be received within 60 days after receipt of the written notification of the adverse determination; however, an extension may be granted if the awardee can show good cause why an extension is warranted.
