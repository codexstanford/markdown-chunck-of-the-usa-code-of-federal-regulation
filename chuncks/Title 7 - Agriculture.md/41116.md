######## Subordinated owner debt.

Debt owed by the borrower to one or more of the owner(s) that is subordinated to debt owed by the borrower to the Agency or guaranteed by the Agency (aggregate B&I loan exposure) pursuant to a subordination agreement satisfactory to the Agency. The debt must have been issued in exchange for cash loaned to the borrower for the benefit of the borrower's business. The terms of the subordination agreement must provide that repayment will not commence until the earlier of the date all aggregate B&I loan exposure has been repaid or when a period of three consecutive years has passed during which the borrower has met all loan covenants and evidenced operating profit sufficient to commence partial repayment of this subordinated debt after giving effect to the annual debt service requirements of the aggregate B&I loan exposure. The partial repayment schedule in the case of the latter scenario is subject to annual Agency concurrence and may not be more accelerated than the rate of the debt repayment schedule in effect for the Agency's aggregate B&I loan exposure.
