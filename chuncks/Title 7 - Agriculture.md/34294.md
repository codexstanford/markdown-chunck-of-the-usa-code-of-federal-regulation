####### Minor error or irregularity

means a defect or variation in a bid that is a matter of form and not of substance. Errors or irregularities are "minor" if they can be corrected or waived without being prejudicial to other bidders and when they do not affect the price, quantity, quality, or timeliness of construction. A minor error or irregularity is not an exception for purposes of determining whether a bid is responsive.
