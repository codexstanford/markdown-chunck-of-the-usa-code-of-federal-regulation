####### Compromise settlement.

(k)Compromise settlements must be approved by the Lender and the Agency. Complete current financial information on all parties obligated for the loan must be provided. At a minimum, the compromise settlement must be equivalent to the value and timeliness of that which would be received from attempting to collect on the guarantee. The guarantor cannot be released from liability until the full amount of the compromise settlement has been received. In weighing whether the compromise settlement should be accepted, among other things, the Agency will weigh whether the compromise is more financially advantageous than collecting on the guarantee.
