######## ยง 51.2964 Rancidity.
######### Rancidity

means the stage of deterioration in which the kernel has developed a rancid flavor. Rancidity should not be confused with a slightly astringent flavor of the pellicle (skin) or with staleness, the stage at which the flavor is flat but not distasteful.
