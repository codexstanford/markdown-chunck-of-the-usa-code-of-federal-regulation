(d) The ratio of grower to handler representation in districts with three members shall alternate each time the term of a Board member from the representative group having two seats expires. During the initial period of the order, the ratio shall be as designated in paragraph (b) of this section.

(e) Board members from districts with one seat may be either grower or handler members and will be nominated and elected as outlined in ยง 930.23.
