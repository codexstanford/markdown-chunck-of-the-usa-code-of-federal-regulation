######## Retainage.

(10)All construction contracts shall contain adequate provisions for retainage. No payments will be made that would deplete the retainage nor place in escrow any funds that are required for retainage nor invest the retainage for the benefit of the contractor. The retainage shall not be less than an amount equal to 10 percent of an approved partial payment estimate until 50 percent of the work has been completed. If the job is proceeding satisfactory at 50 percent completion, further partial payments may be made in full, however, previously retained amounts shall not be paid until construction is substantially complete. Additional amounts may be retained if the job is not proceeding satisfactorily, but in no event shall the total retainage be more than 10 percent of the value of the work completed.
