####### Negotiated lump sum for overhead.

(b)A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate under circumstances where the benefits derived from a State agency's indirect services cannot be readily determined as in the case of a small self-contained or isolated activity. When this method is used, a determination should be made that the amount negotiated will be approximately the same as the actual indirect cost that may be incurred. Such amounts negotiated in lieu of indirect costs will be treated as an offset to total indirect expenses of the State agency before allocation to remaining activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.
