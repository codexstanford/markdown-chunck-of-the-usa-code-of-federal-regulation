####### Estimated loss payment.

(c)The Agency will approve estimated loss payments only after it has approved the lender's liquidation plan. For a loan which has been approved by the Agency for a debt write-down (or debt restructure), the maximum amount of loss payment will not exceed the percent of guarantee multiplied by the difference between the outstanding principal and interest balance of the loan before the write-down and the outstanding balance of the loan after the write-down.

(1) The amount of an estimated loss payment must be credited first as a deduction from the principal balance of the loan with any remaining balance to accrued interest.

(2) The estimated loss payment cannot be applied as a payment on the loan for purposes of reducing the unpaid balance owed by the borrower for status reporting or any debt collection actions against the borrower or any guarantors.
