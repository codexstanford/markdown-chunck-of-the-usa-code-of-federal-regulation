###### Electrical requirements,Mutual capacitance and conductance.

(h)-(1)(i) The average mutual capacitance (corrected for length) of all pairs in any reel shall not exceed the following when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a frequency of 1.0+/-0.1 kilohertz (kHz) and a temperature of 23+/-3 &#xB0;C:

(ii) The root mean square (rms) deviation of the mutual capacitance of all pairs from the average mutual capacitance of that reel shall not exceed 3.0 % when calculated in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90.

(iii) The mutual conductance (corrected for length and gauge) of any pair shall not exceed 3.7 micromhos/kilometer (micromhos/km) (6.0 micromhos/mile) when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a frequency of 1.0+/-0.1 kHz and a temperature of 23+/-3 &#xB0;C.
