######## Prior lienholder's agreement.

(1)If any liens (other than agency liens or tax liens to local governmental authorities) or security agreements (hereafter called "liens"), with priority over the agency mortgage will remain against the real property securing the loan, the lienholders must execute, in recordable form, agreements containing all of the following provisions unless prior approval for different provisions has been obtained from the National Office:

(i) The prior lienholder shall agree not to declare the lien in default or accelerate the indebtedness secured by the prior lien for a specific period of time after notice to the agency. The agreement must:

(A) Provide that the specified period of time will not commence until the lienholder gives written notice of the borrower's default and the prior lienholder's intention to accelerate the indebtedness to the agency office servicing the loan,

(B) Include the address of the agency servicing office,

(C) Give the agency the option to cure any monetary default by paying the amount of the borrower's delinquent payments to the prior lienholder, or pay the obligation in full and have the lien assigned to the agency, and

(D) Provide that the prior lienholder will not declare the lien in default for any nonmonetary reason if the agency commences liquidation proceedings against the property and thereafter acquires the property.

(ii) When the prior lien secures future advances, including the lienholder's costs for borrower liquidation or bankruptcy, which under State law have priority over the mortgage being taken (or an agency mortgage already held), the prior lienholder shall agree not to make advances for purposes other than taxes, insurance or payments on other prior liens without written consent of the agency.

(iii) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency making (or transferring) the loan and taking (or retaining) the related mortgage if the prior lien instrument prohibits a loan or mortgage (or transfer) without the prior lienholder's consent.

(iv) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency transferring the property subject to the prior lien after the agency has obtained title to the property either by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance if the prior lien instrument prohibits such transfer without the prior lienholder's consent.
