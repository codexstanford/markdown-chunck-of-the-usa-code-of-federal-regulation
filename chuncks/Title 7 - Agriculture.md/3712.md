######## ยง 29.3002 Air-cured.

Tobacco cured under natural atmospheric conditions. Artificial heat is sometimes used to control excess humidity during the curing period to prevent house-burn and barn-burn in damp weather. Air-cured tobacco should not carry the odor of smoke or fumes resulting from the application of artificial heat.
