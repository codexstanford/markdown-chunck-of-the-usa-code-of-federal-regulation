######## Chattel property not covered by Agency lien.

(a)(1) When additional chattel property not presently covered by an Agency lien is available and needed to protect the Government's interest, the County Supervisor will obtain one or more of the following:

(i) A lien on such property.

(ii) An assignment of the proceeds from the sale of agricultural products when such products are not covered by the lien instruments.

(iii) An assignment of other income, including FSA Farm Programs (formerly ASCS) payments.

(2) When a current loan is not being made to a borrower, a crop lien will be taken as additional security when the County Supervisor determines in individual cases that it is needed to protect the Government's interests. However, a crop lien will not be taken as additional security for Farm Ownership (FO), Rural Housing (RH), Labor Housing (LH), and Soil and Water (SW) loans. When a new security agreement or chattel mortgage is taken, all existing security items will be described on it.
