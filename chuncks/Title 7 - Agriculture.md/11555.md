######## SNAP civil money penalty for hardship.

(ii)The State agency may disqualify a vendor that has been assessed a civil money penalty for hardship in SNAP, as provided under ยง 278.6 of this chapter. The length of such disqualification must correspond to the period for which the vendor would otherwise have been disqualified in SNAP. If a State agency decides to exercise this option, the State agency must:

(A) Include notification that it will take such disqualification action in its sanction schedule; and

(B) Determine if disqualification of the vendor would result in inadequate participant access in accordance with paragraph (l)(8) of this section. If the State agency determines that disqualification of the vendor would result in inadequate participant access, the State agency may not disqualify the vendor or impose a civil money penalty in lieu of disqualification. The State agency must include documentation of its participant access determination and any supporting documentation in each vendor's file.
