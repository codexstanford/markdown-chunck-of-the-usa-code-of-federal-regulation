####### Acceleration.

(e)The Lender will proceed to accelerate the indebtedness as expeditiously as possible when acceleration is necessary, including giving any notices and taking any other legal actions required. The guaranteed loan will be considered in liquidation once the loan has been accelerated and a demand for payment has been made upon the Borrower. The Lender must obtain from the Agency concurrence prior to the acceleration of the loan if the sole basis for acceleration is a nonmonetary Default. In the case of monetary Default, prior approval by the Agency of the Lender's acceleration is not required, although Agency concurrence must still be given not later than at the time the liquidation plan is approved. The Lender will provide a copy of the acceleration notice or other acceleration document to the Agency.
