###### Applicable results.

(5)(i) The shield or shield/armor resistance per 1000 ft and per kilometer (km) for cable diameters and types of shielding materials are given in Table 1 (English Units) and Table 2 (Metric Units), respectively as follows:

(ii) All values of shield and shield/armor resistance provided in Tables 1 and 2 in (a)(5)(i) of this section are considered approximations. If the measured value corrected to 68 &#xB0;F (20 &#xB0;C) is within #30 percent (%) of the value shown in Table 1 or 2, the shield and shield/armor shall be assumed to be continuous.

(iii) To correct the measured shield resistance to the reference temperature of 68 &#xB0;F (20 &#xB0;C) use the following formulae:

(iv) The temperature coefficients (A) for the shield tapes to be used in the formulae referenced in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section are as follows:

(A) 5 and 10 mil copper = 0.0021 for English units and 0.0039 for Metric units;

(B) 8 mil coated aluminum and 8 mil coated aluminum/6 mil coated steel = 0.0022 for English units and 0.0040 for Metric units;

(C) 5 mil copper clad stainless steel and 5 mil copper clad alloy steel = 0.0024 for English units and 0.0044 for Metric units;

(D) 6 mil copper clad stainless steel = 0.0019 for English units and 0.0035 for Metric units; and

(E) 6 and 7 mil alloy 194 = 0.0013 for English units and 0.0024 for Metric units.

(v) When utilizing shield continuity testers to measure shield and shield/armor continuity within pedestals or splices, refer to the manufacturer's published information covering the specific test equipment to be used and for anticipated results.
