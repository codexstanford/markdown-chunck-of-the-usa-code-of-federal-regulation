####### e.g.,

(c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section as well as applicable cost principles (2 CFR part 200), but for generic promotion activities only, the CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

(1) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except the CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross salary of a GS-15, Step 10 for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;

(2) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are covered only if the exhibit or show is: A food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the United States. The CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which ATP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to ATP Participants via an ATP notice issued on FAS' website.

(i) The CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate or when the ATP Participant fails to notify the Attach&#xE9;/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel, unless the CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notice. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the ATP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the ATP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.
