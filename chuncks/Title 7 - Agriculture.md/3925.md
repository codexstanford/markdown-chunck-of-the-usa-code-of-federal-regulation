######## ยง 29.6002 Air-cured.

Tobacco cured under natural atmospheric conditions. Artificial heat sometimes is used to control excess humidity during the curing period to prevent pole-sweat, pole-burn, and shed-burn in damp weather. Air-cured tobacco should not carry the odor of smoke or fumes resulting from the application of artificial heat.
