###### ยง 4280.313 Grant provisions.

Grants offered under this program will be made to eligible MDOs in such amounts and requirements for microlenders with a loan(s) from the Agency, and for MDOs that seek only a TA grant from the Agency. Competition for these funds will occur as a part of the application and qualification process of becoming a microlender or grant recipient. No entity will receive grant funding as both a microlender and a TA-only provider. RMAP microlenders are not eligible for TA-only grant funding and an MDO receiving TA-only grant funding is not eligible for microlender grant funding. Failure to meet scoring benchmarks will preclude an applicant from receiving loan and/or grant dollars. Once an MDO is participating as a microlender, TA grant funds will be made available annually based on the MDO's lending balances and the availability of funds.
