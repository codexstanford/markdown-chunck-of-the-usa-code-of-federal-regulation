######## Average historical county yield

means the 5-year Olympic determined by FSA as the average of actual average county yields for the most recent 5 years for which data is available, substituting 80 percent of the county transitional yield as defined in this part in each year in which the actual average county yield is less than 80 percent of the county transitional yield. Separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields will be established in a county having a sufficient number of farms with P&CP acreage history of a covered commodity in 2013 through 2017. These separate yields will be established for counties where a covered commodity's P&CP acreage was both irrigated and non-irrigated in 2013 through 2017. If needed, a trend-adjusted yield factor will be used to adjust the yield taking into consideration, but not exceeding, the trend-adjusted yield factor that is used to increase yield history under the crop insurance endorsement under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1520).
