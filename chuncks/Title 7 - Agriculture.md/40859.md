######## Purchase money security interest.

Special type of security interest which, if properly perfected, takes priority over an earlier-perfected security interest. A security interest is a purchase money security interest to the extent that it is taken by the seller of the collateral to secure all or part of its purchase price or by a lender who makes loans or is obligated to make loans or otherwise gives value to enable the debtor to acquire the particular collateral or obtain rights in it. Such value must be given not later than the time the debtor acquires the collateral or obtains rights in it.
