####### Security requirements.

(c)(1) Loans must be adequately secured as determined by FSA. FSA may require certain security, including but not limited to the following:

(i) Assignments of assessments, taxes, levies, or other sources of revenue as authorized by State law;

(ii) Investments and deposits of the applicant; and

(iii) Capital assets or other property of the applicant or its members.

(2) In those cases in which FSA and another lender will hold assignments of the same revenue as collateral, the other lender must agree to a prorated distribution of the assigned revenue. The distribution will be based upon the proportionate share of the applicant's debt the lender holds for the eradication zone from which the revenue is derived at the time of loan closing.
