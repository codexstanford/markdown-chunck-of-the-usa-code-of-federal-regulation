(c)(1) A loss draft which in the opinion of the County Supervisor represents a satisfactory adjustment of the loss will be endorsed immediately without recourse and deposited in a supervised bank account to be used in repairing or replacing the damaged building, except:

(i) Where the amount of the loss is $1,000 or less and the borrower will use the funds for repairing or replacing an essential building, the loss draft may be endorsed without recourse and given to the borrower upon satisfactory proof that the repairs or replacements have been made, or upon satisfactory assurance that the work will be performed.

(ii) When (A) the essential buildings are not to be repaired or replaced and other suitable buildings are not to be erected, or (B) a balance remains after all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made, such insurance funds will be applied on prior liens or as an extra payment to the borrower's loan accounts secured by the real estate or disposed of in accordance with the general principles applicable to the use of proceeds from the sale of a part of the security contained in applicable security servicing regulations for the type loan involved.
