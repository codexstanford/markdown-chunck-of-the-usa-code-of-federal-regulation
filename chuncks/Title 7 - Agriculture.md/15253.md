###### ยง 301.76-4 Labeling requirements for regulated nursery stock produced within an area quarantined for citrus greening.

(a) Effective September 15, 2010, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all regulated nursery stock offered for commercial sale within an area quarantined for citrus greening must have an APHIS-approved plastic or metal tag on which a statement alerting consumers to Federal prohibitions regarding the interstate movement of the article is prominently and legibly displayed. Alternatively, if the article is destined for commercial sale in a box or container, the statement may be printed on the box or container, or printed on a label permanently affixed to the box or container, provided that, in either case, the statement is prominently and legibly displayed. The operator of the site of propagation of the nursery stock and the person offering the plants for commercial sale are jointly responsible for all such labeling.

(b) Nursery stock produced within a quarantined area for planting in a commercial citrus grove within that same area and moved directly to that grove, without movement outside of the quarantined area, may be moved without being labeled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Nursery stock that will be moved interstate in accordance with ยง 301.76-7 may be moved without being labeled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
