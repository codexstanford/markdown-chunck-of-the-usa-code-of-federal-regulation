######## Households with some PA or GA recipients.

(5)State agencies that use the joint application processing procedures in paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(3) of this section may apply these procedures to a SNAP applicant household in which some, but not all, members are in the PA/GA filing unit, except for procedures concerning categorical eligibility. If the State agency decides not to use the joint application procedures for these households, the households shall file separate applications for PA/GA and SNAP benefits. This decision shall not be made on a case-by-case basis, but shall be applied uniformly to all households of this type in a project area.
