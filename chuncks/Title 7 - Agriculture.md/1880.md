###### Mitigation.

(4)(i) No person shall be determined to be ineligible under ยง 12.4 for any action associated with the conversion of a wetland if the wetland values, acreage, and functions are adequately mitigated, as determined by NRCS, through the restoration of a converted wetland, the enhancement of an existing wetland, or the creation of a new wetland, if the mitigation-

(A) Is in accordance with a mitigation plan approved by NRCS;

(B) Is in advance of, or concurrent with, the wetland conversion or the production of an agricultural commodity, as applicable;

(C) Is not at the expense of the federal government in either supporting the direct or indirect costs of the restoration activity or costs associated with acquiring or securing mitigation sites, except if conducted under a mitigation banking program established by USDA;

(D) Occurs on lands in the same general area of the local watershed as the converted wetlands, provided that for purposes of this paragraph, lands in the same general area of the local watershed may include regional mitigation banks;

(E) Is on lands for which the owner has granted an easement to USDA or in the case of a mitigation bank operated under a USDA program, an entity approved by USDA, recorded the easement on public land records, and has agreed to the maintenance of the restored, created, or enhanced wetland for as long as the converted wetland for which the mitigation occurred remains in agricultural use or is not returned to its original wetland classification with equivalent values, acreage, and functions; and

(F) Provides the equivalent values, acreage, and functions that will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion.
