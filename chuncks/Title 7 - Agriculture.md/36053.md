##### ยง 1755.703 Nonmetallic reinforced (NMR) aerial service wire.
###### Identification of pairs and layup of pairs.

(c)(1) The insulation shall be colored coded to identify:

(i) The tip and ring conductor of each pair; and

(ii) Each pair in the completed wire.

(2) The colors to be used in the pairs together with the pair numbers shall be in accordance with the table specified in ANSI/ICEA S-89-648-1993, paragraph 4.1.1.

(3) The insulated conductors shall be either layed parallel (two conductor design only) or twisted into pairs.

(4) When using parallel conductors for the two conductor design, the parallel conductors shall be designed to enable the wire to meet the electrical requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

(5) When twisted pairs are used, the following requirements shall be met:

(i) The pair twists shall be designed to enable the wire to meet the electrical requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section; and

(ii) The average length of pair twists in any pair in the finished wire, when measured on any 3 meter (10 foot) length, shall not exceed the requirement specified in ANSI/ICEA S-89-648-1993, paragraph 4.1.

(6) An alternative method of forming the two-pair wire is the use of a star-quad configuration.

(i) The assembly of the star-quad shall be such as to enable the wire to meet the electrical requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

(ii) The star-quad configuration shall be assembled in accordance with ANSI/ICEA S-89-648-1993, paragraph 4.1.2.

(iii) The average length of twist for the star-quad in the finished wire, when measured on any 3 meter (10 foot) length, shall not exceed the requirement specified in ANSI/ICEA S-89-648-1993, paragraph 4.1.

(iv) The color scheme used to provide identification of the tip and ring conductors of each pair in the star-quad shall comply with the table specified in ANSI/ICEA S-89-648-1993, paragraph 4.1.2.
