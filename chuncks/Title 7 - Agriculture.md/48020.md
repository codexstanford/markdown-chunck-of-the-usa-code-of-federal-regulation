####### Affiliate

means a person where one of the following circumstances exists:

(1) The person controls or has the power to control another person, or a third party or parties' controls or has the power to control both. Factors such as ownership, management, current and previous relationships with or ties to another person, and contractual relationships, shall be considered in determining whether affiliation exists. It does not matter whether control is actually exercised, so long as the power to control exists. Entities owned and controlled by Indian Tribes, Alaskan Native Corporations (ANCs), Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs), or wholly-owned entities of Indian Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs, are not considered to be affiliated with other entities owned by these entities solely because of their common ownership or common management.

(2) There is a family relationship and identical or substantially identical business or economic interests amongst persons (such as where the immediate family operate entities in the same or similar industry in the same geographic area); however, a person may rebut such determination with evidence showing that the business or economic interests are not identical or substantially identical.
