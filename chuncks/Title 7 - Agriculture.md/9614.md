OIG shall also have the right to make audits of the records and operations of any school or child-care institution.

(c) In conducting management evaluations, reviews or audits for any fiscal year, the State agency, FNS, or OIG may disregard any overpayment if the total overpayment does not exceed $600 or, in the case of State agency claims in State administered Programs, it does not exceed the amount established under State law, regulations or procedure as a minimum amount for which claim will be made for State losses but not to exceed $600. However, no overpayment is to be disregarded where there is substantial evidence of violations of criminal law or civil fraud statutes.
