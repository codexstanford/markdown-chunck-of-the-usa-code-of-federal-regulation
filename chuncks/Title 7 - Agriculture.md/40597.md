######### Open listing.

(2)Open listing agreements provide for any licensed real estate broker to provide sales services for any property listed under the terms and conditions of Form RD 1955-42, "Open Real Property Master Listing Agreement." If this method is used, a newspaper advertisement will be published at least once yearly, or a notice sent to all real estate brokers in the counties served by the Rural Development office, informing brokers that sales services are being requested. The advertising will be substantially similar to the example given in Exhibit B of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office). An open listing agreement may be executed at any time during the year, but must be effective prior to the broker showing the property. When this method is used, the Rural Development office is responsible for ensuring that adequate advertising is performed to effectively market the property.
