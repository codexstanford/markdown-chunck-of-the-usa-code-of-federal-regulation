###### Pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance,Pair-to-ground.

(6)-(i)The capacitance unbalance as measured on the completed cable must comply with the requirements specified in ANSI/ICEA S-84-608-1988, paragraph 8.6.

(ii) When measuring pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance all pairs except the pair under test are grounded to the shield and/or shield/armor except when measuring cables containing super units in which case all other pairs in the same super unit must be grounded to the shield.

(iii) The screen tape must be left floating during the test.

(iv) Pair-to-ground capacitance unbalance may vary directly with the length of the cable.
