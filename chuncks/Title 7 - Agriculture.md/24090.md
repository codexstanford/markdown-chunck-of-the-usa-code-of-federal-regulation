######## Provided,

(c) As a pro rata share of the administrative, inspection, research, development, and promotion expenses which the Secretary finds reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Board during a fiscal period, each handler shall pay to the Board assessments on all cherries handled, as the handler thereof, during such period:a handler shall be exempt from any assessment only on the tonnage of handled cherries that either are diverted by destruction at the handler's facilities according to ยง 930.59 or are cherries represented by grower diversion certificates issued pursuant to ยง 930.58(b) and acquired by handlers as described in ยง 930.59.

(d) The Secretary, after consideration of the recommendation of the Board, shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler during the fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be approved and incurred during such period or subsequent period as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments, the Board may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may borrow money for such purposes.
