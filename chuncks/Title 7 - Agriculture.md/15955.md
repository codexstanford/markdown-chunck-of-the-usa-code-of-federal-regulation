######## North, northern.

When used to designate ports of arrival, these terms mean the port of Norfolk, VA, and all Atlantic Coast ports north thereof, ports along the Canadian border, and Pacific Coast ports in the States of Washington and Oregon. When used in a geographic sense to designate areas or locations, these terms mean any State in which cotton is not grown commercially. However, when cotton is grown commercially in certain portions of a State, as is the case in Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri, these terms include those portions of such State as may be determined by the Administrator as remote from the main area of cotton production.
