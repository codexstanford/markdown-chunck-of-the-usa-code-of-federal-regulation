####### ยง 1806.6 Failure of borrower to provide insurance.
######## Insurance canceled for nonpayment of premium.

(c)(1) The County Supervisor, immediately upon receiving a 10-day cancellation notice for a policy, will, if possible, contact the borrower in an effort to have him pay the insurance premium from his own funds or arrange with the agent for subsequent payment by premium note, or otherwise.

(2) If the borrower does not pay or arrange to pay the premium before the policy cancellation is effective, the County Supervisor will, before the cancellation becomes effective, notify the insurance company or broker by certified mail (return receipt requested), that the Agency as mortgagee (or trustee) will pay the premium for one year to continue the policy in effect for that period. The County Supervisor will, in accordance with RD Instruction 2024-A, pay the amount of the premium for a period of one year. The amount of the premium will be charged to the borrower's loan account as a recoverable cost item.

(3) If a property insurance mortgage clause other than Form RD 426-2 is used in connection with the policy and the insurance company or broker refuses to accept payment from the Agency in this manner to reinstate or continue the policy, the County Supervisor will attempt to obtain an acceptable insurance policy from another insurance company or broker in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
