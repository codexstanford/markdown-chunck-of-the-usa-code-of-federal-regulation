####### Interchange agreement

means a contractual arrangement that can include a variety of services utilities provide each other to increase reliability and efficiency, and to avoid duplicating expenses. Some examples are: transmission service (the use of transmission lines to move power and energy from one area to another); emergency service (an agreement by one utility to furnish another with power and energy to protect it in times of emergency, such as power plant outages); reserve sharing (contributions to a common pool of generating plant reserves so that each individual utility's reserves can be reduced); and economic exchanges (swapping power and energy from different plants to avoid running the most expensive units).
