(a) CCC will generally issue tenders for bids, before entering into contracts with any eligible sugar seller or buyer, with the intent of selecting the bid(s) that represents the least cost to CCC of removing sugar from the market.

(b) CCC may, at times, negotiate contracts directly with sellers or buyers, if CCC determines that such negotiation will result in either reduced likelihood of forfeited sugar under the CCC sugar loan program or reduced costs of removing sugar from the market, which will reduce the likelihood of forfeitures of sugar to CCC.
