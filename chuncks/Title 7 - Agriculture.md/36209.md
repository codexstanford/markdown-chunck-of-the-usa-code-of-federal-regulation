###### Screened cable.

(ii)In cables with 25 pairs or less and within each group of multigroup cables, the pair-to-pair capacitance unbalance between any two pairs in an individual compartment must comply with the requirements specified in ANSI/ICEA S-84-608-1988, paragraph 8.5. The pair-to-pair capacitance unbalances to be considered must be:

(A) Between pairs adjacent in a layer in an individual compartment;

(B) Between pairs in centers of 4 pairs or less in an individual compartment; and

(C) Between pairs in adjacent layers in an individual compartment when the number of pairs in the inner (smaller) layer is 6 or less. The center is counted as a layer.

(iii) In cables with 25 pairs or less, the root-mean-square (rms) value is to include all the pair-to-pair unbalances measured for each compartment separately.

(iv) In cables containing more than 25 pairs, the rms value must include the pair-to-pair unbalances in the separate compartments.
