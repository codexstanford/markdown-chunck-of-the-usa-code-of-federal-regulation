###### PMD

(27)means the statistical upper bound for the PMD coefficient of a fiber optic cable link composed of M number of randomly chosen concatenated fiber optic cable sections of the same length. The upper bound is defined in terms of a probability level Q, which is the probability that a concatenated PMD coefficient value exceeds PMD, ITU G recommendations for fiber optic cables call for M = 20 and Q = 0.01%. This PMDvalue is the one used in the design of fiber optic links.
