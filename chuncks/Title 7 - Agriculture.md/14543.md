(2) The firm has failed to meet the eligibility requirements for authorization under Criterion A or Criterion B, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; or, for co-located wholesale/retail firms, the firm fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section. Any firm that has been denied authorization on these bases shall not be eligible to submit a new application for authorization in the program for a minimum period of six months from the effective date of the denial;

(3) The firm has been found to lack the necessary business integrity and reputation to further the purposes of the program. Such firms shall be denied authorization in the program for the following period of time:

(ii) Firms which have been officially removed from other Federal, State or local government programs through administrative action shall be denied for a period equivalent to the period of removal from any such programs; or, if the firm is not removed from the program, but FNS determines a pattern (3 or more instances) exists evidencing a lack of business integrity on the part of the owners, officers or managers of the firm, such firm shall be denied for a one year period effective from the date of denial;

(iii) Firms for which evidence exists of an attempt to circumvent a period of disqualification, a civil money penalty, or fine imposed for violations of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, and program regulations shall be denied for a period of three years from the effective date of denial;

(iv) Firms for which evidence exists of prior SNAP violations by owners, officers, or managers of the firm for which a sanction had not been previously imposed and satisfied shall be denied for a period of time equivalent to the appropriate disqualification period for such previous violations, effective from the date of denial;

(v) Firms for which evidence exists of prior SNAP violations at other units of multi-unit firms as specified in § 278.1(b)(3)(v) for which a sanction had not been previously imposed and satisfied shall be denied for a period of time equivalent to the appropriate disqualification period for such previous violations, effective from the date of denial;

(vi) Firms for which any other evidence exists which reflects negatively on the business integrity or business honesty of the owners, officers or managers of the firm as specified in § 278.1(b)(3)(vi) shall be denied for a period of one year from the effective date of denial;

(4) The firm has filed an application that contains false or misleading information about a substantive matter, as specified in § 278.6(e). Such firms shall be denied authorization for the periods specified in § 278.6(e)(1) or § 278.6(e)(3);

(5) The firm's participation in the program will not further the purposes of the program;

(6) The firm has been found to be circumventing a period of disqualification or a civil money penalty through a purported transfer of ownership;

(7) The firm has failed to pay in full any fiscal claim assessed against the firm under § 278.7, any fines assessed under §§ 278.6(l) or 278.6(m), or a transfer of ownership civil money penalty assessed under § 278.6(f). The FNS officer in charge shall issue a notice to the firm (using any delivery method that provides evidence of delivery) to inform the firm of any authorization denial and advise the firm that it may request review of that determination.
