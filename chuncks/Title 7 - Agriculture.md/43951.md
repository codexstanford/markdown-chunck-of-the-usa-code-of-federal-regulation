####### Non-Agency trainers.

(3)Prior to offering the required course to packagers and intermediaries, non-Agency trainers must obtain approval from designated Agency staff. Non-Agency trainers, who will generally be limited to housing nonprofit organizations but may in rare cases include public bodies such as public universities, must provide proof of relevant experience and resources for delivery; present evidence that their individual trainers are competent and knowledgeable on all subject areas; submit course materials for Agency review; agree to maintain attendance records, test results, and updated course materials; and bear the cost of providing the training though a reasonable tuition fee may be charged the course participants. The course content, schedule, and tuition must be approved by RHS and a designated Agency staff member will typically participate in each training session to ensure accuracy of the program information and to serve as a program resource. A list of eligible non-Agency trainers, which is subject to change based on non-Agency trainers' performance, will be published by the Agency.
