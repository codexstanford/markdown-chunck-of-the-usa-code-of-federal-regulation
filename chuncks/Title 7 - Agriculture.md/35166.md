####### Weighted-average remaining useful life of the assets

means the estimated original average life of the assets to be acquired with the proceeds of the private lender notes expressed in years based on depreciation rates less the number of years those assets have been in service (or have been depreciated). It shall be determined by calculating the sum of each asset's remaining value expressed as a fraction of the total remaining value of the assets, times the estimated number of years and fraction of years remaining until the assets are fully depreciated.
