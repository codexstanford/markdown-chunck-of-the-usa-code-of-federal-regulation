######## Companies.

(a)It is desirable that companies be licensed to do business in the particular State or other jurisdiction where the property is located, or that they be otherwise authorized by law to transact business within such State or other jurisdiction (hereinafter called "State"). If the required insurance is not available locally at comparable rates from an insurance company licensed or otherwise authorized to do business in the State, insurance may be accepted from another company if (1) the OGC advises that policies issued by such company will not be rendered unenforceable by virtue of the company's failure to be licensed or otherwise authorized to transact business in the State and that the company is a legal entity which may be sued in the State where the insured property is located, and (2) the State Director determines that the company is reputable and financially sound. In making the above determinations, the State Director will consider all relevant available information such as that which may be obtained from financial statements, Best's Insurance Reports, State insurance authorities, and other lending institutions.
