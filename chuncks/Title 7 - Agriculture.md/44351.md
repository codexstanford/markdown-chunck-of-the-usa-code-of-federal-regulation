####### Transfer without triggering the due-on-sale clause.

(d)(1) The following types of transfers do not trigger due-on-sale clauses in security instruments:

(i) A transfer from the borrower to a spouse or children not resulting from the death of the borrower;

(ii) A transfer to a relative, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety resulting from the death of the borrower;

(iii) A transfer to a spouse or ex-spouse resulting from a divorce decree, legal separation agreement, or property settlement agreement;

(iv) A transfer to a person other than a deceased borrower's spouse who wishes to assume the loan for the benefit of persons who were dependent on the deceased borrower at the time of death, if the dwelling will be occupied by one or more persons who were dependent on the borrower at the time of death, and there is a reasonable prospect of repayment; or

(v) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower does not transfer rights of occupancy in the property.

(2) When a transferee obtains a property with a guaranteed loan through a transfer that does not trigger the due-on-sale clause:

(i) The lender will notify Rural Development of the transfer;

(ii) Rural Development will continue with the guarantee, whether or not the transferee assumes the guaranteed loan;

(iii) The transferee may assume the guaranteed loan on the rates and terms contained in the promissory note. If the account is past due at the time an assumption agreement is executed, the loan may be re-amortized to bring the account current;

(iv) The transferee may assume the guaranteed loan under new rates and terms if the transferee applies and is eligible.

(3) Any subsequent transfer of title, except upon the death of the inheritor or between inheritors to consolidate title, will trigger the due-on-sale clause.
