######## Fee-for-service.

(e)(1) Under this system, the processor must sell end products to the distributing or recipient agency, as appropriate, at a fee-for-service, which includes all costs to produce the end products not including the value of the donated food used in production. Three basic types of fee-for-service are used:

(i) Direct shipment and invoicing from the processor to the recipient agency;

(ii) Fee-for-service through a distributor, where the processor ships multiple pallets of product to a distributor with a breakout of who owns what products; and

(iii) What is commonly known as Modified Fee-for-service, when the recipient agency has an authorized agent bill them for the total case price.
