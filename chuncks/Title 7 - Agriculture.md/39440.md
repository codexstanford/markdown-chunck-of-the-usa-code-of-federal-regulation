######## Prefinal inspections.

(5)A prefinal inspection will be made by the owner, resident inspector, project architect or engineer, representatives of other agencies involved, the District Director and a Rural Development State Office staff representative, preferably the State Staff architect or engineer. Prefinal inspections may be made without Rural Development State Office staff participation if the State Director or a designee determines that the facility does not utilize complicated construction techniques, materials or equipment for facilities such as small fire stations, storage buildings or minor utility extensions, and that an experienced District Office staff representative will be present. The inspection results will be recorded on Form RD 1924-12, "Inspection Report," and a copy provided to all appropriate parties.
