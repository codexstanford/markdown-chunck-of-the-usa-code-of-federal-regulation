######## Payment for work done by the borrower method,Payments for labor.

(3)-(i)Before the County Supervisor countersigns checks for labor, the borrower must submit a completed Form RD 1924-11, "Statement of Labor Performed," for each hired worker performing labor during the pay period. Ordinarily, checks for labor will be made payable to the workers involved. However, under justifiable circumstances, when the borrower has paid for labor with personal funds and has obtained signatures of the workers on Form RD 1924-11 as having received payment, the County Supervisor may countersign a check made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenditures. Under no circumstances will the County Supervisor permit loan funds or funds withdrawn from the supervised bank account to be used to pay the borrower for the borrower's own labor or labor performed by any member of the borrower's household.
