###### Probable causes for nonconformance.

(8)Some of the causes for failing to obtain the desired results may be due to nonlinearity of the phase versus frequency characteristic of the transmission facility. This nonlinear phase versus frequency characteristic of the transmission facility causes the various frequency components to travel at different transit times which results in successively transmitted data pulses to overlap at the receive end. The overlapping of the pulses at the receive end results in distortion of the received signal. Excessive EDD on the transmission facility may be reduced using data modems with equalization or by conditioning the transmission line.
