######## FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 affirmative action.

(c)(1) It is the policy of the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to administer its housing program affirmatively so individuals of similar income levels in the housing market area have housing choices available to them regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Each participant in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 housing program shall pursue affirmative fair housing marketing policies in soliciting buyers and tenants, in determining their eligibility and in concluding sales and rental transactions.

(2) Applicability. The affirmative fair housing marketing requirements shall apply as follows:

(i) Participants in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 housing programs who request approval for subdivision development involving five or more sites, multi-family projects with five or more units including self-help technical assistance grantees assisting five or more families or five or more conditional commitments for single family dwelling units during a 12-month period must submit an affirmative marketing plan.

(ii) An Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan is required to be prepared and submitted to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 by the contractor when:

(A) A real estate broker is offering five or more single-family dwellings located in the same subdivision for sale under an exclusive listing contract with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.

(3) Affirmative fair housing marketing plans will be submitted on form HUD 935.2(3-76) or the participant must be a signatory to a voluntary affirmative marketing agreement approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The plan, if submitted on form HUD 935.2(3-76) shall describe an affirmative program which will meet the following requirements:

(ii) Undertaking and/or maintaining a non-discriminatory hiring policy in recruiting from both majority and minority groups including both sexes, for staff engaged in the sale or rental of properties.

(iii) Training and instructing employees engaged in the sale or rental properties in the policy and application of nondiscrimination and fair housing.

(iv) Displaying in all sales and rental offices the "Fair Housing" poster.

(v) Posting in a conspicuous position on each property and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 construction site a sign displaying the equal opportunity logo or the following statement:

(vi) Undertaking efforts to publicize the availability of housing opportunities to minority persons through the type of media customarily used by the applicant or participant, including minority publications and other minority outlets available in the housing market area. As part of these efforts all advertising must include either the equal housing opportunity logo or statement. When illustrations or persons are included they shall depict persons of both sexes and of majority and minority groups.

(iv) For real estate brokers listing housing properties on an exclusive basis, at any time more than 5 properties are listed for sale by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in the same subdivision.

(5) Affirmative fair housing marketing plans will cover the following time periods:

(i) For subdivision, from time of application until all lots are sold.

(ii) For multi-family projects from time of application until the loan is paid in full or for so long as the project is being used for the same or a similar purpose for which the funds were extended.
