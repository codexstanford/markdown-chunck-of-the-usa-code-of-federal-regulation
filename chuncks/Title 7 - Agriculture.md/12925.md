####### Reduction method.

(c)If a reduction in allotments is deemed necessary, the maximum SNAP allotments amounts for all household sizes shall be reduced by a percentage specified by FNS. For example, if it is determined that a 25 per cent reduction in the maximum SNAP allotments amount is to be made, the reduction for all four-person households would be calculated as follows: The maximum SNAP allotments amount for a four-person household ($209 in November 1980) would be reduced by 25% to $157. Then 30 percent of the household's net SNAP income would be deducted from the reduced maximum SNAP allotments amount. For example, 30 per cent of a net SNAP income of $200, $60, would be deducted from the reduced maximum SNAP allotments amount ($157), resulting in a reduced allotment of $97.
