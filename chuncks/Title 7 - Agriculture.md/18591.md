######## An EIS is required for:

(a)

(2) Projects requiring Congressional action;

(3) Broad Federal assistance programs administered by NRCS when the environmental evaluation indicates there may be significant cumulative impacts on the human environment (ยง 650.7(e)); and

(4) Other major Federal actions that are determined after environmental evaluation to affect significantly the quality of the human environment (ยง 650.7(b)). If it is difficult to determine whether there is a significant impact on the human environment, it may be necessary to complete the EE and prepare an EA in order to decide if an EIS is required.
