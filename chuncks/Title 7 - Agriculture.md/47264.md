###### ยง 4287.134 Transfer and assumption.

The lender may request a transfer and assumption of a guaranteed loan in situations where the total indebtedness, or less than the total indebtedness, is transferred to another eligible borrower on the same or different terms. A transfer and assumption of the borrower's operation can be accomplished before or after the loan goes into liquidation. However, if the collateral has been purchased through foreclosure or the borrower has conveyed title to the lender, no transfer and assumption is permitted. Additionally, no transfer and assumption is permitted when the Agency has repurchased 100 percent of the guaranteed portion of the loan.
