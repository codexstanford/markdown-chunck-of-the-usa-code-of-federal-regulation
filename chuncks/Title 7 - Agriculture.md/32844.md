######## Amendments to the payment guarantee.

(k)A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee may be submitted only by the seller, with the written concurrence of the assignee, if any, and must be accompanied by the revised firm sales contract, if applicable. The Director will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable program announcements and sufficient budget authority exists. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. CCC reserves the right to request additional information from the seller to justify the request and to charge a fee for amendments. Such fees will be announced and available on the USDA Web site. Any request to amend the foreign financial institution on the payment guarantee will require that the holder of the payment guarantee resubmit to CCC the certification in ยง 1493.310(c)(1)(i) or ยง 1493.330(d).
