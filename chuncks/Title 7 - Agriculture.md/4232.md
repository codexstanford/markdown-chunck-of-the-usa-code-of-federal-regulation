####### ยง 42.105 Basis for selection of sample.
######## Maximum sample units per case.

(e)If the lot is cased, predetermine the number of containers to draw from each sampled case as well as the position within the case. Do not restrict the sampling to the top or bottom layers or to the corners. The best sample is one selected from all the various positions in the shipping case. It is desirable but not mandatory to limit the number of sample units to a single container from any one case. Multiple sample units may be taken from a single case but not in excess of the following plan:

(1) When containers are packed 12 or less to a case, draw a maximum of 6 sample units from any one case; and

(2) When containers are packed more than 12 to a case but not more than 60, draw a maximum of 12 sample units from any one case; and

(3) When containers are packed more than 60 to a case but not more than 250, draw a maximum of 16 sample units from any one case; and

(4) When containers are packed more than 250 in a case, draw a maximum of 24 sample units from any one case.
