######## Imposition of disqualification penalties.

(2)(i) If the household member suspected of intentional Program violation signs the disqualification consent agreement, the household member shall be disqualified in accordance with the disqualification periods specified in paragraph (b) of this section, unless contrary to the court order. The period of disqualification shall begin within 45 days of the date the household member signed the disqualification consent agreement. However, if the court imposes a disqualification period or specifies the date for initiating the disqualification period, the State agency shall disqualify the household member in accordance with the court order.

However, the disqualified member's household shall continue to be responsible for repayment of the overissuance which resulted from the disqualified member's intentional Program violation regardless of its eligibility for Program benefits.
