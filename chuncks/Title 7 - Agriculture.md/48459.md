###### Loan Provisions
####### ยง 5001.408 Participation or assignment of guaranteed loan.
######## Rights and liabilities.

(e)When a guaranteed portion of a loan is assigned to a holder using an assignment guarantee agreement, the holder succeeds to all rights of the lender under the loan note guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The full, legal interest in the promissory note must remain with the lender, and the lender remains bound to all obligations under the loan note guarantee, lender's agreement, and Agency regulations applicable to the guarantee.

(1) A guarantee and right to require purchase in accordance with ยง 5001.511 will be directly enforceable by a Holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation by the lender or any unenforceability of the loan guarantee by the lender, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time it became the holder or in which the holder participates or condones.

(2) The lender must not represent a conditional commitment of guarantee as a loan guarantee.

(3) The lender must reimburse the Agency for any payments the Agency makes to a holder on the lender's behalf under the loan note guarantee, given the lender would not be entitled to the payments had they retained the entire interest in the loan.
