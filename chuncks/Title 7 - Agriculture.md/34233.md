####### Structures for raptor protection.

(a)(1) RUS standard distribution line structures may not have the extra measure of protection needed in areas frequented by eagles and other large raptors to protect such birds from electric shock due to physical contact with energized wires. Where raptor protection in the design of overhead line structures is required by RUS; a Federal, State or local authority with permit or license authority over the proposed construction; or where the borrower voluntarily elects to comply with the recommendations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or State wildlife agency, borrowers are permitted to deviate from RUS construction standards, provided:

(i) Structures are designed and constructed in accordance with "Suggested Practices for Raptor Protection on Powerlines: The State of the Art in 1996" (Suggested Practices for Raptor Protection); and,

(ii) Structures are in accordance with the NESC and applicable State and local regulations.
