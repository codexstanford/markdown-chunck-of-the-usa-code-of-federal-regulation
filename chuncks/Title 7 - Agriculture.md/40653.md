######### General.

(a)When property is being sold by Rural Development or through real estate brokers, it is the servicing official's responsibility to ensure adequate advertising of property to achieve a timely sale. The primary means of advertisements are newspaper advertisements in accordance with RD Instruction 2024-F (available in any Rural Development office), public notice using Form RD 1955-41, "Notice of Sale," and notification of known interested parties. Other innovative means are encouraged, such as the use of a bulletin board to display photographs of inventory properties for sale with a brief synopsis of the property attached; posting Forms 1955-40 or 1955-43, as appropriate, in the reception area to attract applicant and broker interest; posting notices of sale at employment centers; door-to-door distribution of sales notices at apartment complexes; radio and/or television spots; group meetings with potential applicants/investors/real estate brokers; and advertisements in magazines and other periodicals. If Rural DevelopmentFmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel are not available to perform these services, Rural Development may contract for such services in accordance with Rural Development Instruction 2024-A (available in any Rural Development office).
