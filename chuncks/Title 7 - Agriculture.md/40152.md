######## Affiliation agreements.

(d)An affiliation agreement between the borrower and a third party may be approved by the State Director, with OGC concurrence, if it provides for shared services between the parties and does not result in changes to the borrower's legal organizational structure which would result in its loss of control over its assets and/or over the operation, management, and maintenance of the facility to the extent that it cannot carry out its responsibilities as set forth in ยง 1942.17(b)(4) of subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter. However, affiliation agreements which result in a loss of borrower control may be approved with prior concurrence of the Administrator if the loan is reclassified as a nonprogram loan and the borrower is notified that it is no longer eligible for any program benefit. Requests forwarded to the Administrator will contain the case file, the proposed affiliation agreement, and necessary supporting information.
