###### Cooperation with television film producers.

(b)The Department recognizes that its people and programs constitute a rich source of materials on public services, often dramatic and interesting for their human values, which are suitable for production of films for television showings. The Department welcomes the interest of television film producers in its activities and maintains an "open door" policy with respect to the availability of factual information to such producers, as it does to representatives of other media. As its resources will permit, the Department will work with producers at their request, to assure technical accuracy of scripts and story treatments.
