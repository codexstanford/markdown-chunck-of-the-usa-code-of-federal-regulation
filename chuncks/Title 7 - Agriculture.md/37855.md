######## Protecting property.

(a)It is the responsibility of the borrower to immediately notify the County Supervisor and insurance company or agent of any loss or damage to insured property and collect the amount of the loss. When the County Supervisor learns of a loss to property which secures an Agency loan, he will:

(1) Check the borrower's casefile for an insurance policy or other evidence of insurance. When a policy or other evidence of insurance has not been retained by the Agency, such as for FP and section 502 RH borrowers, the County Supervisor will determine whether the property was insured and whether the Agency was named as mortgagee in the insurance policy.

(2) Determine that the borrower has taken such steps as are necessary to protect the interest of the Agency in the security property against further damage. When serious problems arise with respect to protecting the property from further damage, the borrower cannot or will not arrange adequate protection for the property, or when legal action appears to be necessary, the County Supervisor will arrange for emergency protection and immediately refer the case with complete information to the State Director.
