####### Filing an estimated loss claim.

(f)When the lender owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender must file an estimated loss claim once a decision has been made to liquidate if the liquidation is expected to exceed 90 days. The estimated loss payment will be based on the liquidation value of the collateral. For the purpose of reporting and loss claim computation, for loans closed on or after August 2, 2016, the guarantee will not cover note interest to the lender accruing after 90 days from the most recent delinquency effective date. The Agency will promptly process the loss claim in accordance with applicable Agency regulations as set forth in ยง 4287.158.
