######## Documentation for energy replacement.

(A)For a RES project to qualify as energy replacement, the applicant must provide documentation in its application on prior energy use incurred by the applicant. Proposed energy use, such as that attributed to an expansion, is not considered in the replacement calculation. For a RES project involving new construction and being installed to serve the new facility, the project can be classified as energy replacement only if the applicant can document prior energy use from a facility that is within plus or minus 10 percent of the size of the facility it is replacing. The estimated quantities of energy must be converted to either BTUs, watts, or similar energy equivalents to facilitate scoring.
