######## Wetland restoration

means the rehabilitation of degraded or lost wetland and associated habitats pursuant to published State-specific criteria and guidelines developed in coordination with the State technical committee in a manner such that:

(1) The original, native vegetative community and hydrology are, to the extent practical, reestablished; or

(2) A hydrologic regime and native vegetative community different from what likely existed prior to degradation of the site is established that will:

(i) Substantially replace the original habitat functions and values while providing significant support or benefit for migratory waterfowl or other wetland-dependent wildlife; or

(ii) Address local resource concerns or needs for the restoration of wetland functions and values for wetland-dependent wildlife as identified in an approved State wildlife action plan or NRCS national initiative.
