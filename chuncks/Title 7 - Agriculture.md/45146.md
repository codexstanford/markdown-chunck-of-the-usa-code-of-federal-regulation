####### Sales price.

(a)For the purposes of establishing a sales price when a borrower is required or elects to sell a housing project to a nonprofit organization or public body, two independent appraisals will be ordered, one by the Agency and one by the borrower. Both appraisals will conclude market value and be in accordance with subpart P of this part. If the borrower's assessment of the Agency's appraised market value indicates that no further appraisal is needed, the borrower may agree to accept the Agency's appraisal.

(1) The expense of the borrower's appraisal shall be borne by the borrower. The appraiser selected may not have an identity of interest with the borrower.

(2) If the two appraisers fail to agree on the market value, the Agency and the borrower will jointly select an appraiser whose appraisal will be binding on the Agency and the borrower. The Agency and the borrower shall jointly fund the cost of the appraisal.
