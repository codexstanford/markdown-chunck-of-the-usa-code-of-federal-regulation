###### ยง 1714.8 Hardship rate loans.
####### Rate disparity test for hardship.

(a)(1)The borrower meets this test if its average revenue per kWh sold is not less than 120 percent of the average revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service, and its average residential revenue per kWh is not less than 120 percent of the average residential revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service. To determine whether a borrower meets this test, RUS will compare the borrower's average total revenue and average residential revenue with statewide data in the table of Average Revenue per Kilowatthour for Electric Utilities by Sector, Census Division and State, in the Electric Power Annual issued by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy (DOE), or the successor to this table. The test will be based on the most recent calendar year for which full year DOE data are available at the time of loan approval and borrower data for the same year.
