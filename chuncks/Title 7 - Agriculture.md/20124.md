######## Non-program loan

is a loan on terms more stringent than terms for a program loan that is an extension of credit for the convenience of the Agency, because the applicant does not qualify for program assistance or the property to be financed is not suited for program purposes. Such loans are made or continued only when it is in the best interest of the Agency.
