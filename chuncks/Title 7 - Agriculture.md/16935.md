###### Criteria for accreditation of non-government facilities.

(b)(1) Specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection are set forth in this part and may be obtained by writing to APHIS. If specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection have not been promulgated by APHIS, and the Administrator determines that accreditation in that area is practical, APHIS will develop appropriate standards applicable to accreditation in the area for which the non-government facility is seeking accreditation and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in theto inform the public and other interested persons of the opportunity to comment on and participate in the development of those standards.

(2) The operator of a non-government facility seeking accreditation to conduct laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection shall submit an application to the Administrator. The application must be completed and signed by the operator of the facility or his or her authorized representative and must contain the following:

(i) Legal name and full address of the facility;

(ii) Name, address, and telephone and fax number of the operator of the facility or his or her authorized representative;

(iii) A description of the facility, including its physical plant, primary function, scope of operation, and, if applicable, its relationship to a larger corporate entity; and

(iv) A description of the specific laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is seeking accreditation.

(3) Upon receipt of the application, APHIS will review the application to identify the scope of the assessment that will be required to adequately review the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking accreditation. Before the assessment of the facility begins, the applicant's representative must agree, in writing, to fulfill the accreditation procedure, especially to receive the assessment team, to supply any information needed for the evaluation of the facility, and to enter into a trust fund agreement as provided by paragraph (c) of this section to pay the fees charged to the applicant facility regardless of the result of the assessment and to pay the charges of subsequent maintenance of the accreditation of the facility. Once the agreement has been signed, APHIS will assemble an assessment team and commence the assessment as soon as circumstances permit. The assessment team will measure the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking accreditation against the specific standards identified by the Administrator for those services by reviewing the facility in the following areas:
