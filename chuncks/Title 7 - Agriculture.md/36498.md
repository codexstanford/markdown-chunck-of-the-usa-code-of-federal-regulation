###### Encapsulant flow test.

(vi)Terminal connection encapsulant must remain stable at 80+/-1 &#xB0;C (176+/-2 &#xB0;F) when tested in an environmental chamber. Test specimens shall be suspended in a preheated oven over a glass dish or other drip-catching medium for a period of 24 hours. At the end of the test period, the glass dish shall be examined for evidence of flowing or dripping of encapsulant from the cross-connect terminal. More than 0.5 gram of encapsulant in the dish at the end of the test constitutes failure.
