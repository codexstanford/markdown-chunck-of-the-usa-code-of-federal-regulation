####### Exhibit A to Subpart A of Part 1962 - Memorandum of Understanding Between Commodity Credit Corporation and Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354

IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (hereinafter referred to as "FHA") and the Commodity Credit Corporation (hereinafter referred to as "CCC") that the following procedure will be observed in those cases where producers sell to CCC or pledge to CCC as loan collateral under the Price Support Program, agricultural commodities such as, but not limited to, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, rice, soybeans, grains, on which FHA holds a prior lien and the proceeds from such sales or loans are not remitted to FHA for application against the loan(s) secured by such lien:

1. When an FHA County Supervisor learns that an FHA borrower has obtained a loan from CCC on a commodity or sold a commodity to CCC under such circumstances, he shall immediately notify his State Director. The State Director, immediately upon receipt of the notice, shall furnish CCC (see Appendix 1) with the name and address of such borrower, the county of his location at the time the commodity was placed under loan or sold, and the amount of the FHA loan secured by the lien.

2. When CCC receives such a notice from FHA, CCC shall take steps to prevent the making of any further loans on or purchases of the commodity of the borrower. If the CCC loan is still outstanding and CCC calls the loan, CCC shall notify the FHA State director of the demand.

3. If the CCC loan is repaid, whether prior to or after the receipt by CCC of the notice from FHA, the FHA State Director shall be notified immediately, at which time CCC will have discharged its responsibility under this agreement.

4. FHA shall, in each case in which the CCC loan is not repaid or the commodity has been sold to CCC, endeavor to collect from the borrower the amount due on the FHA loan. Such collection efforts shall include the making of demand on the borrower and the following of FHA's normal administrative policies with respect to the collection of debts, but shall not include the making of demand for payment upon the area peanut producer cooperative marketing associations through which CCC makes price support available to producers. If collection efforts are not successful, the FHA County Supervisor shall make a complete report on the matter to his State Director. If the State Director determines that the amount due on the FHA lien is not collectible by administrative action, he shall refer the matter to the appropriate local office of the General Counsel, with a full statement of the facts, for a determination of the validity of the FHA lien. If it is determined by the General Counsel's Office that FHA holds a valid prior lien on the commodity, the State Director shall furnish CCC with a copy of such determination, together with all other pertinent information, and shall request payment to FHA of the lesser of (1) the amount due on its loan, or (2) the value of the commodity at the time the CCC loan or purchase was made (based on the market value of the commodity on the local market nearest to the place where the commodity was stored). The information to be furnished CCC shall include (a) the principal balance plus interest due FHA on the date of the request, (b) the amount due on the FHA loan at the time the CCC loan or purchase was made, and (c) the amount of the CCC loan or purchase proceeds, if any, applied by the producer against the FHA loan. FHA shall continue to make collection efforts and shall notify CCC of any amount collected from the producer or any other party.
