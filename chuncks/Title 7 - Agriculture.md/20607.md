######## General.

(a)(1) Proceeds from the sale of basic security and normal income security must be remitted to lienholders in order of lien priority.

(2) Proceeds remitted to the Agency may be used as follows:

(i) Applied to the FLP loan;

(ii) Pay customary costs appropriate to the transaction.

(3) With the concurrence of all lienholders, proceeds may be used to preserve the security because of a natural disaster or other severe catastrophe, when funds cannot be obtained by other means in time to prevent the borrower and the Agency from suffering a substantial loss.

(4) Security may be consumed as follows:

(i) Livestock may be used by the borrower's family for subsistence;

(ii) If crops serve as security and usually would be marketed, the Agency may allow such crops to be fed to the borrower's livestock, if this is preferable to marketing, provided the Agency obtains a lien or assignment on the livestock, and livestock products, at least equal to the lien on the crops.
