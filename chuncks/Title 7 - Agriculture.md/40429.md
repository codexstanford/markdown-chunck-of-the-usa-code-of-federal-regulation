######## Cooperative agreements.

(3)Cooperative agreements between Rural Development and other entities may be made to accomplish the requirement where the principal purpose is to provide money, property, services or items of value to state or local governments or other recipients to accomplish a public purpose. Exhibit C of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office) is an example of a typical cooperative agreement. A USDA handbook providing detailed guidance for all parties is available from the USDA-Office of Operations and Finance. Although cooperative agreements are not a contracting action, the authority, responsibility and administration of these agreements will be handled consistent with contracting actions.
