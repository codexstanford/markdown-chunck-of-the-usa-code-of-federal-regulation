####### Proposed funded service area (PFSA)

means the area (whether all or part of an existing or new service area) where the applicant is requesting funds to provide broadband service. Multiple service areas will be treated as separate standalone service areas for the purpose of determining how much of the PFSA does not have sufficient access to broadband. Each service area must meet the minimum requirements for the appropriate funding category to be an eligible area.
