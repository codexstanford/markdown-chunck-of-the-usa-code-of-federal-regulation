####### Guarantees.

(4)The lender must determine the collectability of unsecured personal and corporate guarantees required in accordance with ยง 5001.204 of this part. The lender must promptly collect or otherwise dispose of such guarantees prior to completion of the final loss report. However, if collection from the guarantors appears unlikely or will require a prolonged period of time, the lender must file the report of loss when all other collateral has been liquidated. Unsecured personal or corporate guarantees outstanding at the time of the submission of the final report of loss will be treated as a Future Recovery with the net proceeds to be shared on a pro rata basis by the lender and the Agency.
