(b) Prevent a decline in U.S. commercial export sales.

(c) Substitute commercial dollar sales for sales made pursuant to Pub. L. 480 or other concessional programs.

(d) Result in a new use of the agricultural commodity in the importing country.

(e) Permit expanded consumption of agricultural commodities in the importing country and thereby increase total commercial sales of agricultural commodities to the importing country.
