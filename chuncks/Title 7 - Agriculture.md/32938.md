######## Amendments.

(i)A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. (Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as amendments.)
