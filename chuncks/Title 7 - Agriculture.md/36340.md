(i) The attenuation methods must be per Table 8.4,of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(c)).

(ii) The cable must have a maximum attenuation of 0.1 dB at a point of discontinuity (a localized deviation of the optical fiber loss). Per paragraphs 8.4 and 8.4.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(c)), measurements must be conducted at 1310 and 1550 nm, and at 1625 nm when specified by the end user.

(iii) The cable cutoff wavelength (&#x3B3;) must be reported per paragraph 8.5.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference in ยง 1755.901(c)).
