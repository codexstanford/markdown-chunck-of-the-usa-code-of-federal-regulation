######## Use of title insurance.

(e)When title insurance is to be obtained, the approval official will be furnished with a title insurance binder disclosing any defects in, exceptions to, and encumbrances against, the title, the conditions to be met to make the title insurable and in the condition required by the agency, and the curative or other actions to be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must include a commitment to issue a lender policy in an amount at least equal the amount of the loan, except in instances where there may be an outstanding owner's policy in favor of the borrower. Not withstanding the provisions of this section, the instance of an assumption without a subsequent loan, the existing policy may be continued if the coverage meets or exceeds the assumption balance and the title company agrees in writing to extend coverage in full force and effect.
