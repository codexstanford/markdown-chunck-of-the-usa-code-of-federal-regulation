####### Highest and best use statement and analysis.

(d)The highest and best use is to be concluded for the subject site as though it was vacant, and for the subject property as improved, if improvements have been made. If the highest and best use of a subject property is for something other than MFH, the appraisal report must provide this information to the Agency for consideration in the loan process. In addition to being reasonably probable and appropriately supported, the highest and best use of both the land as though vacant and the property as improved must meet four implicit criteria. The highest and best use must be:

(1) Physically possible;

(2) Legally permissible;

(3) Financially feasible; and

(4) Maximally productive.
