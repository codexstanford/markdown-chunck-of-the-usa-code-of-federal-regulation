######## Accelerated payments.

(d)CCC will pay claims only on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due as a result of the claimant invoking an accelerated payment clause in the firm sales contract, the foreign financial institution letter of credit, the terms and conditions document (if applicable), or any obligation owed by the foreign financial institution to the holder of the payment guarantee that is related to the letter of credit issued in favor of the seller, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare up to the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued ordinary interest, in default, require the holder of the payment guarantee to invoke the acceleration provision in the foreign financial institution letter of credit or, if applicable, in the terms and conditions document, require submission of all claims documents specified in ยง 1493.360, and make payment to the holder of the payment guarantee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.
