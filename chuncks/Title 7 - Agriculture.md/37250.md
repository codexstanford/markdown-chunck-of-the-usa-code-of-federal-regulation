(k)When security includes special assessment to be collected over the life of the loan, the instrument should address the method of applying any payments made before they are due. It may be desirable for such payments to be distributed over remaining payments due, rather than to be applied in accordance with normal procedures governing extra payments, so that the account does not become delinquent.
