##### ยง 1755.403 Copper cable telecommunications plant measurements.
###### Impedance or pulse return pattern.

(i)The step-by-step measurement procedure using the impedance or pulse return pattern for loaded and nonloaded loops shall be as shown in Figure 8. An artificial line of the same makeup as the cable to be tested shall be set up. The traces of the impedance or pulse return pattern from the cable pair and the artificial line shall be compared and should be essentially identical. If the impedance or pulse return traces from the cable pair are different than the artificial line trace, cable faults are possible. When the cable pair trace indicates possible defects, the defects should be identified and located. One method of identifying and locating defects involves introducing faults into the artificial line until its trace is identical with the cable trace.
