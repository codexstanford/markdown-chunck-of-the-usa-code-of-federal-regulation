####### Timing of request for changes.

(c)Borrowers must submit rent and utility allowance change requests in conjunction with the annual budget submission as required under ยง 3560.303(d). The effective dates of any approved changes will coincide with the start of the housing project's fiscal year or the start of the season for seasonally occupied farm labor housing. However, the Agency will accept borrower requests for rent or utility allowance changes anytime during the year if a change is necessary to preserve the financial integrity of the housing complex and the financial distress is due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control.
