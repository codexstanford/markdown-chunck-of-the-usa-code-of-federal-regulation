B. Arrange plantings with evergreen wind buffers on north side and deciduous trees on south.

C. Whenever possible, orient entry door away from winter winds.

D. Design house with simple shape to minimize exterior wall area.

E. Minimize glass areas within constraints of required light and ventilation, applicable safety codes and other appropriate consideration.

F. Minimize the amount of paved surface adjacent to the structure where heat gain is not desirable.
