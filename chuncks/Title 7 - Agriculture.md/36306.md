##### ยง 1755.902 Minimum performance Specification for fiber optic cables.
###### Coating.

(8)The optical fiber must be coated with a suitable material to preserve the intrinsic strength of the glass having an outside diameter of 250 +/-15 micrometers (10 +/-0.6 mils). Dimensions must be measured per the methods of paragraph 7.13 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(c)). The protective coverings must be free from holes, splits, blisters, and other imperfections and must be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with the best commercial practice. The diameter of the fiber, as the fiber is used in the cable, includes any coloring thickness or the uncolored coating, as the case may be. The strip force required to remove 30 +/-3 millimeters (1.2 +/-0.1 inch) of protective fiber coating must be between 1.0 N (0.2 pound-force) and 9.0 N (2 pound-force).

(9) All optical fibers in any single length of cable must be of the same type, unless otherwise specified by end user.

(10) Optical fiber dimensions and data reporting must be as required by paragraph 7.13.1.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(c)).
