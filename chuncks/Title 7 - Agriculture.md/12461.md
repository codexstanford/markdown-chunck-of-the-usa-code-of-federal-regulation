######## Use of donated foods in the nonprofit school food service.

(b)The school food authority must use donated foods, as much as is practical, in the lunches served to schoolchildren, for which they receive an established per-meal value of donated food assistance each school year. However, the school food authority may also use donated foods in other activities of the nonprofit school food service. Revenues received from such activities must accrue to the school food authority's nonprofit school food service account, in accordance with ยง 210.14 of this chapter. Some examples of such activities in which donated foods may be used include:

(1) School breakfasts or other meals served in child nutrition programs;

(2) A la carte foods sold to schoolchildren;

(3) Meals served to adults directly involved in the operation and administration of the nonprofit school food service, and to other school staff; and

(4) Training in nutrition, health, food service, or general home economics instruction for students.
