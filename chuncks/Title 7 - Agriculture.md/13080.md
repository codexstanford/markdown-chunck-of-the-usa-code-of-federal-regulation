####### Amendment No. 355.

(134)The provisions of Amendment No. 355 are effective and must be implemented on August 1, 1994. Any variance resulting from implementation of the provisions of this amendment shall be excluded from error analysis for 120 days from this required implementation date in accordance with 7 CFR 275.12(d)(2)(vii) as modified by section 13951(c)(2) of Pub. L. 103-66. The provisions must be implemented for all households that newly apply for Program benefits on or after the required implementation date. The current caseload shall be converted to these provisions at household request, at the time of recertification, or when the case is next reviewed, whichever occurs first, and the State agency must provide restored benefits back to the required implementation date. If for any reason a State agency fails to implement on the required implementation date, restored benefits shall be provided, if appropriate, back to the required implementation date or the date of application, whichever is later.
