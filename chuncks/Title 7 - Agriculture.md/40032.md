######## Notifying borrowers of payments.

(c)County Supervisors will notify borrowers of the dates and amounts of payments that have been agreed on for all types of accounts. Form RD, "Reminder of Payment to be Made," or similar form approved by the State Director, will be used. The form will not contain any language indicating that an account is delinquent. These notices will be timed to reach borrowers immediately before the receipt of the income from which the payments should be made or before the installment due date on the note, as appropriate, and may include other pertinent information such as a reference to agreements reached during the year and sources of income from which the payment was planned. Such notices need not be sent when frequent payments are scheduled and the borrower customarily makes the payments when due.
