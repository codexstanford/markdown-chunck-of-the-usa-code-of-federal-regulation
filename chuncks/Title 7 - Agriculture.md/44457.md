####### Farm.

A tract or tracts of land, improvements, and other appurtenances that are used or will be used in the production of crops, livestock, or aquaculture products for sale in sufficient quantities so that the property is recognized as a farm rather than a rural residence. The term "farm" also includes the term "ranch." It may also include land and improvements and facilities used in a non-eligible enterprise or the residence that, although physically separate from the farm acreage, is ordinarily treated as part of the farm in the local community.
