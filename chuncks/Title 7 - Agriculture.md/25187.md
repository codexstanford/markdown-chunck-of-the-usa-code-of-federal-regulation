######## Inshell allocation,Preliminary computed percentages.

(c)-(1)Prior to September 20 of a marketing year, the Board shall compute and announce preliminary computed free and restricted percentages for that year, to release 80 percent of the inshell trade demand for that year. The preliminary computed free percentage shall be computed by multiplying that trade demand, adjusted by the declared carryin, by 80 percent, and by dividing that amount by the Board's estimate of orchard-run production less the average disappearance during the preceding three years, plus the undeclared carryin. The difference between 100 percent and the preliminary free percentage shall be the preliminary computed restricted percentage. At the same time, the Board may announce the portion of the restricted supply that may be shelled or exported, and the remainder of that supply to be disposed of in outlets approved by the Board pursuant to ยง 982.52.
