(a) When other Agencies are directly involved in any undertaking that requires a historical and archeological assessment, the State Director will contact the Agencies concerned to determine if a joint assessment will be prepared and whether a single lead Agency will assume primary responsibility for preparing the assessment.

(b) When a lead Agency is agreed upon other than FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will provide that Agency with information about its respective areas of responsibility. Assessments will indicate Agency participation and concurrence.

(c) When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program activities are planned that primarily supplement those of the SCS, USDA, such as watershed projects, resource conservation and development measures, and irrigation and drainage projects, the SCS will be designated as the lead Agency.
