##### Foreign buyer and foreign seller.

(i)A person whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is outside the United States. Foreign buyer or foreign seller includes a person who maintains a place of doing business outside the United States even though the transaction is concluded in the United States by his agent who has a place of business in the United States or by his employee who does not maintain a place of doing business in the United States. (If such employee maintains a place of doing business in the United States with respect to the transaction, the resulting contract is construed to be a domestic sale.) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all foreign governments, agencies and instrumentalities are considered foreign buyers or foreign sellers even though transactions are concluded by their employees in the United States or they maintain a place of business with respect to the transaction in the United States.
