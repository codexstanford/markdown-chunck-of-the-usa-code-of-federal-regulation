######## Construction.

(1)Payment for construction must be for amounts shown on payment estimate forms. Form RD 1924-18, "Partial Payment Estimate," may be used for this purpose or other similar forms may be used with the prior approval of the District Director. However, the District Director cannot require more reporting burden than is required by Form RD 1924-18. Advances for contract retainage will not be made until such retainage is due and payable under the terms of the contract. The review and acceptance of project cost, including construction partial payment estimates, by RD does not attest to the correctness of the amounts, the quantities shown, or that the work has been performed under the terms of agreements or contracts.
