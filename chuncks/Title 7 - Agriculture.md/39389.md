######## Separate contracts.

(3)Arrangements which split responsibility of contractors (separate contracts for labor and material, extensive subcontracting and multiplicity of small contracts on the same job), should be avoided whenever it is practical to do so. Contracts may be awarded to suppliers or manufacturers for furnishing and installing certain items which have been designed by the manufacturer and delivered to the job site in a finished or semifinished state such as perfabricated buildings and lift stations. Contracts may also be awarded for material delivered to the job site and installed by a patented process or method.
