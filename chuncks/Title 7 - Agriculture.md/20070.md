######## Good faith

is when an applicant or borrower provides current, complete, and truthful information when applying for assistance and in all past dealings with the Agency, and adheres to all written agreements with the Agency including, but not limited to, loan agreement, security instruments, farm operating plans, and agreements for use of proceeds. The Agency considers a borrower to act in good faith, however, if the borrower's inability to adhere to all agreements is due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control. In addition, the Agency will consider fraud, waste, or conversion actions, when substantiated by a legal opinion from OGC, when determining if an applicant or borrower has acted in good faith.
