Dielectric strength is tested by connecting one lead from a 500-volt ac at 0.5 ampere source to the cabinet ground connector and the other lead is passed along the surfaces of all cabinet components in the vicinity of unsheathed cable or harness conductors, cross-connect wire paths, and in the splice area where unsheathed field cable conductors may be located. Sparkover constitutes failure.
