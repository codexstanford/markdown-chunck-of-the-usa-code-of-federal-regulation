####### ยง 1421.10 Loan repayment rates.

(a) For the applicable crop years of barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, wheat, dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, oilseeds, wool, mohair, and other crops as designated by CCC (other than peanuts, long grain rice, medium grain rice, and confectionery and each other kind of sunflower seed (other than oil sunflower seed)), a producer may repay a nonrecourse MAL at a rate that is the lesser of:

(2) A rate (as determined by the Secretary) that is calculated based on average market prices for the loan commodity during a preceding 30-day period and that the Secretary has determined will minimize discrepancies in marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and across county boundaries; or

(3) A rate that the Secretary may develop using alternative methods for calculating a repayment rate for a loan commodity that the Secretary determines will: Minimize potential loan forfeitures; minimize the accumulation of stocks of the commodity by the Federal Government; minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing the commodity; allow the commodity produced in the U.S. to be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally; and minimize discrepancies in marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and across county boundaries.

(b) To the extent practicable, CCC will determine and announce repayment rates under paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section based upon market prices at appropriate U.S. markets as determined by CCC and these repayment rates may be adjusted to reflect grade, type, quality, location, and other factors for each crop of a commodity as follows:

(1) On a weekly basis in each county for oilseeds, except canola, flaxseed, soybeans, and sunflower seed;

(2) On a daily basis in each county for barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, sunflower seed and wheat; and

(3) On a weekly basis regionally for dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, wool and mohair.

(1) A producer may repay a nonrecourse MAL for peanuts at a rate that is the lesser of:

(i) The loan rate established for the commodity under ยง 1421.9, plus interest; or

(ii) A rate that the Secretary determines will: Minimize potential loan forfeitures; minimize the accumulation of stocks of the commodity by the Federal Government; minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing the commodity; and allow the commodity produced in the United States to be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally.

(2) To the extent practicable, CCC will determine and announce weekly alternative repayment rates for peanuts.

(d) For peanuts, the Secretary will require the repayment of handling and other associated costs paid under ยง 1421.104 for all peanuts pledged as collateral for a MAL that are redeemed under this section.

(e) The Secretary will permit producers to repay a MAL for long grain rice and medium grain rice at a rate that is the lesser of:

(1) The loan rate established for the commodity under ยง 1421.9, plus interest; or

(2) The prevailing world market price for the commodity, as determined and adjusted by the Secretary in accordance with this section.

(f) For purposes of this section, the Secretary will prescribe-

(1) A formula to determine the prevailing world market price for long grain rice and medium grain rice and

(2) A mechanism by which the Secretary will announce periodically those prevailing world market prices.

(g) Adjustments will be made to the prevailing world market price for long grain rice and medium grain rice.

(1) The prevailing world market price for long grain and medium rice determined under paragraph (f) of this section will be adjusted to U.S. quality and location.

(2) In making adjustments under this subsection, the Secretary will establish a mechanism for determining and announcing the adjustments in order to avoid undue disruption in the U.S. market.

(h)(1) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice will be determined by CCC based upon a review of prices at which rice is being sold in world markets and a weighting of such prices through the use of information such as changes in supply and demand of rice, tender offers, credit concessions, barter sales, government-to-government sales, special processing costs for coatings or premixes, and other relevant price indicators, and will be expressed in U.S. equivalent values F.O.B. (free on board) vessel, U.S. port of export, per hundredweight as follows:

(i) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, long grain milled rice;

(ii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, medium grain milled rice; and

(iii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, short grain milled rice.

(2) Export transactions involving rice and all other related market information will be monitored on a continuous basis. Relevant information may be obtained for this purpose from USDA field reports, international organizations, public or private research entities, international rice brokers, and other sources of reliable information.

(3) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice adjusted to U.S. quality and location, the adjusted world price (AWP), as determined under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, will apply to this section.

(4) The adjusted world price for each class of rice will equal the prevailing world market price for a class of rice (U.S. equivalent value) as determined under paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section and adjusted to U.S. quality and location as follows:

(i) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice will be adjusted to reflect an F.O.B. mill position by deducting from such calculated price an amount that is equal to the estimated national average costs associated with:

(A) The use of bags for the export of U.S. rice, and

(B) The transfer of such rice from a mill location to F.O.B. vessel at the U.S. port of export with such costs including, but not limited to, freight, unloading, wharfage, insurance, inspection, fumigation, stevedoring, interest, banking charges, storage, and administrative costs.

(ii) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the market value of the total quantity of whole kernels contained in milled rice by deducting the world value of broken kernels it contains, with the value of the broken kernels determined by multiplying a formulaic quantity of broken kernels (4 percent per hundredweight) by the world market value of broken kernels. The world market value of broken kernels will be based upon the relationship of whole and broken kernel world prices as estimated from observations of prices at which rice is being sold in world markets.

(iii) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the per-pound market value of whole kernels by dividing the price by the quantity of whole milled kernels contained in the milled rice (96 percent per hundredweight).

(iv) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the market value of whole kernels contained in 100 pounds of rough rice by multiplying such price by the estimated national average quantity of whole kernel rice by class obtained from milling 100 pounds of rough rice.

(v) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the total market value of rough rice by:

(A) Adding to such price:
