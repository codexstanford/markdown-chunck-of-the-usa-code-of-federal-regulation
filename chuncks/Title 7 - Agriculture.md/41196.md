######## Special Mention Classification.

(1)Those loans which do not presently expose the lender and Rural Development to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant a Substandard classification but do possess credit deficiencies deserving the lender's close attention. Failure to correct these deficiencies could result in greater credit risk in the future. This classification would include loans that the lender is unable to supervise properly because of a lack of expertise, an inadequate loan agreement, the condition of or lack of control over the collateral, failure to obtain proper documentation or any other deviations from prudent lending practices. Adverse trends in the borrower's operation or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet which has not reached a point that jeopardizes the repayment of the loan should be assigned to this designation. Loans in which actual, not potential, weaknesses are evident and significant should be considered for a Substandard classification.
