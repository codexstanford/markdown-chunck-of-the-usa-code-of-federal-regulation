####### Payment date.

(e)Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income availability and be in accordance with State law.

(1) If income is available monthly, monthly payments are recommended unless precluded by State law. If income is available quarterly or otherwise more frequently than annually, payments must be scheduled on such basis. However, if State law only permits principal plus interest (P&I) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be used.

(2) The payment schedule will be enumerated in the evidence of debt, or if that is not feasible, in a supplemental agreement.

(3) If feasible, the first payment will be scheduled one full month, or other period, as appropriate, from the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th, and 31st day of the month will be avoided. When principal payments are deferred, interest-only payments will be scheduled at least annually.
