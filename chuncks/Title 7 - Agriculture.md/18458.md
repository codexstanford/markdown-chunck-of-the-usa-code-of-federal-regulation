(c)(1) Cost-share payments are to be made by the administering agency at the cost-share percentage and by one of the following methods designated by the administering agency and set out in the contract:

(i) Average cost, or

(ii) Actual cost not to exceed average cost.

(2) If the average cost at the time of starting the installation of a BMP or identifiable unit is less than the costs specified in the contract, payment is to be at the lower rate. If the costs at the start of installation are higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A modification will be necessary if the higher cost results in a significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. Cost-share payment is not to be made until the modification reflecting the increase is approved.
