####### Bathtub and shower stalls.

(xviii)The housing project must have tubs or shower stalls which are free of cracks, breaks, and leaks, and a strainer in good condition and in place. The housing project must have walls and floors of the bathtubs which are properly caulked, tops and sides of shower stalls must be properly caulked, and the finish is free of chips, damage, or signs of rust.

(4) The Agency expects that upon discovery of a condition not in compliance with the standards listed in this section that the borrower will remedy the situation in a timeframe required by the Agency. The Borrower must provide documentation and justification for any failure to meet such timeframe. Properties with deficiencies in the process of being addressed will not be deemed to be out of compliance unless there are so many deficiencies that it would result in a declaration of substantial noncompliance and call into questions the viability of the property and the effectiveness of the borrower's maintenance program. Failure to make such corrections or repairs constitutes a non-monetary default under ยง 3560.452(e).
