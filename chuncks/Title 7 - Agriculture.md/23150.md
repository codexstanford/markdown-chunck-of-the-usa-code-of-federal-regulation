Pursuant to the regulations in ยง 1.4(b) of this title, AMS will maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes of all material required to be made available in ยง 1.2(a) of this title. Notice is hereby given that publication of these indexes is unnecessary and impractical, since the material is voluminous and does not change often enough to justify the expense of publication.
