######## Protective advances.

(v)Protective advances are payments made by a lender for items such as insurance or taxes, to protect the financial interest of the lender, and charged to the borrower's loan account. To the extent consistent with State law and customary lending practices in the area, repayment of protective advances made by either lender, for the mutual protection of both lenders, should receive first priority in apportionment of funds between the lenders. To ensure agreement between lenders, efforts should be made to obtain the concurrence of both lenders before one lender makes a protective advance.
