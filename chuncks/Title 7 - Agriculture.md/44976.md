####### Loan assumption interest rates.

(i)The interest rate for Agency loans assumed in conjunction with an ownership transfer or sale will be determined as follows:

(1) The interest rate for all loans, except farm labor housing loans, will be set at the lower of:

(i) The note rate of the existing Agency loan;

(ii) The Agency note rate on the day the transfer is approved;

(iii) The Agency note rate on the day the transfer is closed; or

(iv) If the rents are increased due to a transfer, the transfer will be done under new rates and terms when the Agency determines that it is in the best interest of the government. Subsequent loan may be in the form of a senior, junior or parity lien or soft second.

(2) The interest rate on farm labor housing loans will be the rate specified in the note, except that loans transferred to public bodies, nonprofit organizations of farm workers, and broadly-based nonprofit corporations for farm labor housing purposes may be at a one percent interest rate regardless of the rate specified in the note if the Agency determines that such a reduction is necessary to maintain affordable rental rates for tenants.
