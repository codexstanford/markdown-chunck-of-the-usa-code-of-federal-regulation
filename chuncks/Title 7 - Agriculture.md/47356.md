####### Decision to liquidate.

(a)A decision to liquidate or proceed otherwise must be made when the Lender determines that the Default cannot be cured through actions such as those contained in ยง 4287.345, or it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Agency and the Lender to liquidate. The decision to liquidate or proceed otherwise with the Borrower must be made as soon as possible when one or more of the following exist:

(1) A loan is 90 days behind on any scheduled payment and the Lender and the Borrower have not been able to cure the Delinquency through actions such as those contained in ยง 4287.345.

(2) It is determined that delaying liquidation will jeopardize full recovery on the loan.

(3) The Borrower or Lender is uncooperative in resolving the problem or the Agency or Lender has reason to believe the Borrower is not acting in good faith, and immediate liquidation would minimize loss to the Agency.
