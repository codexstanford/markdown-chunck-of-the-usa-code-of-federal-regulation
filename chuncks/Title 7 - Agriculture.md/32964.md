######## Assignment.

(a)(1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless approved in advance by CCC, be:

(i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties; or

(ii) Subject to further assignment.

(2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
