######### Grade B.

(d)If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped styles are reasonably free from defects, a score of 32 to 35 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). "Reasonably free from defects" means that any defects present but not specifically limited in Table V may not more than materially affect the appearance or edibility of the olives; and in addition, specified defects may be present in all other styles except "broken pitted" not to exceed the allowances for grade B provided in Table V.
