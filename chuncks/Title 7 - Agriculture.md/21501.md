######## Door-probe sample.

A sample taken with a probe from a lot of bulk grain that is loaded so close to the top of the carrier that it is possible to insert the probe in the grain only in the vicinity of the tailgate of the truck or trailer, the door of the railroad boxcar, or in a similarly restricted opening or area in the carrier in which the grain is located or is loaded in hopper cars or barges in such a manner that a representative sample cannot be obtained.
