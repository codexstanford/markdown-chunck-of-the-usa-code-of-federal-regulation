##### ยง 1.905 Designation procedures.

(a) To obtain a designation from OIRA, USDA agencies shall prepare and submit to OBPA a designation request for guidance documents. Designation requests must include the following information:

(1) A summary of the guidance document; and

(2) The agency's recommended designation of "not significant," or "significant," as well as a justification for that designation.

(b) OBPA shall seek a significance determination from OIRA for guidance documents, as appropriate, in the same manner as for rulemakings. Prior to publishing a guidance document, and with sufficient time to allow OIRA to review the document in the event that it is designated "significant," USDA shall provide OIRA with an opportunity to review the designation request or the guidance document, if requested, to determine if it meets the definition of "significant" under Executive Order 13891.
