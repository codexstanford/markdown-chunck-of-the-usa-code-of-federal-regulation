###### Noise.

(ii)Some of the common causes for failing to obtain the desired results may be due to high power influence from paralleling electrical power systems, poor telephone circuit balance, discontinuous cable shields, inadequate bonding and grounding of cable shields, high capacitance unbalance-to-ground of the cable pairs, high dc loop resistance unbalance, dc loop current less than 20 milliamperes, etc. The above factors can occur singularly or in combination. See TE&CM Section 451, Telephone Noise Measurement and Mitigation, for steps to be taken in reducing telecommunications line noise.
