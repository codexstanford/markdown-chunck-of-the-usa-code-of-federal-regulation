###### ยง 247.24 Recovery and redistribution of caseload and administrative funds.
####### Is there a limit on the amount of caseload slots or administrative funds that FNS may recover?

(b)Yes. FNS will not unilaterally recover caseload that would result in the recovery of more than 50 percent of the State's administrative funds. However, in instances in which the State agency requests that FNS recover any portion of its assigned caseload, the 50-percent limitation will not apply.
