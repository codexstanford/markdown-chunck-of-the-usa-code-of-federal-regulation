(c)In its course examinations or other procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement, a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results of the evaluation represent the students' achievements in the course, rather than reflecting the students' impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).
