() The loan approval official may waive title defects or restrictions, such as utility easements, that do not adversely affect the suitability, successful operation, security value, or transferability of the facility. If the District Director is the loan approval official and is unable to waive the defect or restriction, the title opinion or title insurance binder will be forwarded to the State Director. If the State Director, with the advice of the OGC, determines that the defect or restriction cannot be waived, the defect or restriction must be removed.
