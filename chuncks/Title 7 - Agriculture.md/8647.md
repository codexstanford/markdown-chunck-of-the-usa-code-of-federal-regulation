####### ยง 201.45 Obtaining the working sample.

(a) The working sample on which the actual analysis is made shall be taken from the submitted sample in such a manner that it will be representative.

(b) The sample shall be repeatedly divided to the weight to be used for the working sample. Some form of efficient mechanical divider should be used. To avoid damaging large seeds and coated seeds, a divider should be used which will prevent the seeds from falling great distances onto hard surfaces. In case the proper mechanical divider cannot be used or is not available, the sample shall be thoroughly mixed and placed in a pile and the pile shall be repeatedly divided into halves until a sample of the desired weight remains.
