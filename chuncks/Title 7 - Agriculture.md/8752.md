(a)Shedders in the seed parent, at any one inspection, are limited to 1:200 heads for Foundation A Line and 1:100 heads for Registered A Line, except that when the A Line is increased outside the area of the anticipated A x R production in order to utilize self-fertility produced by environmental effects, only isolation and genetic purity standards will be in effect. (An A Line is a cytoplasmic male sterile female line used to produce hybrid seed. An R Line is a pollinator line used to pollinate an A Line and to restore fertility in the resulting hybrid seed.)
