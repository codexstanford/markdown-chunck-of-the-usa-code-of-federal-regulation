######## Economic feasibility requirements.

(h)All projects financed under the provisions of this section must be based on taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other satisfactory sources of revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for facility operation and maintenance, a reasonable reserve, and debt payment. An overall review of the applicant's financial status, including a review of all assets and liabilities, will be a part of the docket review process by the Rural Development staff and approval official. If the primary use of the facility is by business and the success or failure of the facility is dependent on the business, then the economic viability of that business must be assessed. The number of users for a rural business will be based on equivalent dwelling units, which is the level of service provided to a typical rural residential dwelling.
