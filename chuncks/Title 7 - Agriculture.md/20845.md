######## Maintenance of revolving fund.

(a)The intermediary lender must maintain the HFIL revolving fund until all of its HFIL obligations have been paid in full. All HFIL loan funds received by an intermediary lender must be deposited into an HFIL revolving fund account. Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations. All cash of the HFIL revolving fund must be deposited in a separate bank account or accounts so as not to be commingled with other financial assets of the intermediary lender. All money deposited in such bank account or accounts must be security assets of the HFIL revolving fund. Loans to ultimate recipients must be from the HFIL revolving fund.

(1) The portion of the HFIL revolving fund that consists of Agency HFIL loan funds may only be used for making loans in accordance with ยง 769.105. The portion of the HFIL revolving fund that consists of repayments from ultimate recipients may be used for debt service, reasonable administrative costs, or for making additional loans;

(2) An intermediary lender may use revolving funds and HFIL loan funds to make loans to ultimate recipients without obtaining prior Agency concurrence in accordance with the Intermediary Relending Agreement;

(3) Any funds in the HFIL revolving fund from any source that is not needed for debt service, approved administrative costs, or reasonable reserves must be available for additional loans to ultimate recipients;

(4) All reserves and other funds in the HFIL revolving loan fund not immediately needed for loans to ultimate recipients or other authorized uses must be deposited in accounts in banks or other financial institutions. Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations, and will be interest bearing. Any interest earned thereon remains a part of the HFIL revolving fund;

(5) If an intermediary lender receives more than one HFIL loan, it does not need to establish and maintain a separate HFIL revolving loan fund for each loan; it may combine them and maintain only one HFIL revolving fund, unless the Agency requires separate HFIL revolving funds because there are significant differences in the loan purposes, Intermediary Relending Agreement, loan agreements, or requirements for the loans; and

(6) A reasonable amount of revolved funds must be used to create a reserve for bad debts. Reserves should be accumulated over a period of years. The total amount should not exceed maximum expected losses, considering the quality of the intermediary lender's portfolio of loans. Unless the intermediary lender provides loss and delinquency records that, in the opinion of the Agency, justifies different amounts, a reserve for bad debts of 6 percent of outstanding loans must be accumulated over 5 years and then maintained.
