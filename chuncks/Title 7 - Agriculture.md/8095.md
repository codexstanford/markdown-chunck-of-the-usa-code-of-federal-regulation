Two information symbols in the form of AMS shields indicate commodity testing at an AMS laboratory listed in ยง 91.5 of this part. The AMS shield set forth in figure 1 of this section, containing the words "USDA AMS TESTED", and the shield set forth in figure 2, containing the words "USDA LABORATORY TESTED FOR EXPORT" have been approved by the USDA Office of Communications to be added to the USDA/AMS inventory of symbols.

Shields with the same wording that are similar in form and design to the examples in figures 1 and 2 of this section may also be used.
