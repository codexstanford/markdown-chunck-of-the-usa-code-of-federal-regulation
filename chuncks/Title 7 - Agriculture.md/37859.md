######## Servicing insurance losses under special circumstances,Foreclosures and voluntary conveyances.

(e)-(1)Losses on properties in process of foreclosure or voluntary conveyance will be handled with the advice of the OGC. If the necessary cooperation of the borrower cannot be obtained, the State Director, with the advice of the OGC, will determine the proper action to be taken. To the extent feasible from a legal and practical standpoint, all loss payments should be received for a damaged or destroyed building and applied on the borrower's real estate indebtedness before title to the property is taken by the Government through foreclosure sale, voluntary conveyance, or otherwise, unless absolute assignment has been made by the borrower to the Government of all loss funds due from the insurance company.
