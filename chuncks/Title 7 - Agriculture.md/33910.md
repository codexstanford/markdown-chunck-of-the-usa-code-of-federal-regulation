####### Advance of funds.

(g)(1) The advance of funds from 100 percent private loans lien accommodated or subordinated by RUS will not be subject to RUS approval. It is the private lender's responsibility to adopt reasonable measures to ensure that such loan funds are used for the purposes for which the loan was made and the lien accommodation or subordination granted. RUS encourages lenders to adopt the following measures:

(i) Remit loan advances to a separate subaccount of the Cash-Construction Fund-Trustee Account;

(ii) Obtain a certification from a registered professional engineer, for each year during which funds from the separate subaccount are utilized by the borrower, that all materials and equipment purchased and facilities constructed during the year from said funds comply with RUS safety and performance standards, as required by paragraph (f) of this section, and are included in an CWP or CWP amendment.

(iii) Obtain an auditor's certification from a Certified Public Accountant, for each year during which funds are advanced to or remitted from the separate subaccount, certifying:

(A) The amount of loan funds advanced to and remitted from the separate subaccount during the period of review;

(B) That based on the auditor's review of construction work orders and other records, all moneys disbursed from the separate subaccount during the period of review were used for purposes contemplated in the loan agreement and the lien accommodation; and

(iv) Immediately notify RUS in writing if the lender is unable to obtain the certifications cited in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section.

(2) The measures listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section will normally be sufficient to meet the lender's responsibility provided that additional measures are not reasonably required based on the particular circumstances of an individual case. Should a lender fail to carry out its responsibility in the manner described in this paragraph (g) or in another manner acceptable to RUS, RUS may disqualify such lender from participation in advance approval under §§ 1717.854 and 1717.857 and condition the lender's receipt of a lien accommodation or subordination upon the lender providing satisfactory evidence that it will fulfill its responsibility under this paragraph (g).
