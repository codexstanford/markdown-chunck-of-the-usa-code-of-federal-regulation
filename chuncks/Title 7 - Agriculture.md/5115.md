The size of pecan halves in a lot may be specified in accordance with one of the size classifications shown in Table I:

(1) When an exact number of halves per pound is specified, the actual count per pound may vary not more than 5 percent from the specified number; and,

(2) When any size classification shown in Table I or a range in count per pound is specified, no tolerance shall be allowed for counts outside of the specified range.
