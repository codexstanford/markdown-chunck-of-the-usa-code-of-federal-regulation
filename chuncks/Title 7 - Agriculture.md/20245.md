###### ยง 762.101 Introduction.
####### Type of guarantee.

(d)Guarantees are available for both a loan note or a line of credit. A loan note is used for a loan of fixed amount and term. A line of credit has a fixed term, but no fixed amount. The principal amount outstanding at any time, however, may not exceed the line of credit ceiling contained in the contract. Both guarantees are evidenced by the same loan guarantee form.
