###### ยง 3560.306 Reserve account.
####### Changes to reserve requirements.

(j)(1) As projects age, the required reserve account level may be adjusted to meet anticipated "life-cycle" needs, including equipment and facility replacement costs, by amending the loan agreement/resolution.

(2) The Agency will allow for an annual adjustment to increase reserve account funding levels by Operating Cost Adjustment Factor (OCAF) as published by HUD annually. This will require a modification to the Loan agreement and the increase documented with budget submission as outlined in ยง 3560.303.

(3) The Agency may approve a change in the reserve account funding level based on the findings of an approved capital needs assessment. The approval to increase reserve account funding levels will take into consideration the housing project's approved budget and the housing project's ability to support increased reserve account deposits without causing basic rents to exceed conventional rents for comparable units in the area.
