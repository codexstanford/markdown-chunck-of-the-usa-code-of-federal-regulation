####### High density test.

(c)If the average number of consumers per mile of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the interest rate cap will not apply to funds used for the purpose of furnishing or improving electric service to consumers located in an area that is an urban area at the time of loan approval, notwithstanding that the area must have been deemed a rural area for the purpose of qualifying for a loan under this part. (See the definition of "rural area" in 7 CFR 1710.2.) If the average number of consumers per mile of line of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the borrower must include, as a note on RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, submitted as part of the loan application for a loan subject to the interest rate cap, a breakdown of funds included in the proposed loan to furnish or improve service to consumers located in such urban areas. For such borrowers only funds for those facilities serving consumers located outside an urban area are eligible for the interest rate cap.
