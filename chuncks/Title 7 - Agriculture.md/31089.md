####### ยง 1437.503 Covered losses and recordkeeping requirements for covered tropical crops.

(a) Prevented planting coverage is not available for covered tropical crops.

(b) Except in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and other areas approved by the Deputy Administrator, or as otherwise approved by the Deputy Administrator in individual cases, eligible causes of loss for covered tropical crops will only include hurricanes, typhoons, and named tropical storms.

(c) Producers who have applied for coverage on covered tropical crops must maintain for the full coverage period contemporaneous records. Contemporaneous records are those created at the time of planting and harvesting of the crop for which the application for coverage is filed. In this regard:

(1) Producers may be selected on a random or targeted basis for compliance review with this requirement and any other requirements that may apply to this program.

(2) A failure to maintain acceptable contemporaneous records throughout the crop year may be treated by FSA as grounds of ineligibility for benefits under this part.
