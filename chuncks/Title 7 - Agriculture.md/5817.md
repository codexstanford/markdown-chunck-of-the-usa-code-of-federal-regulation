####### Sampling
######## ยง 52.38a Definitions of terms applicable to statistical sampling.
######### Probability of acceptance ("Pa").

(4)The probability that a portion of production, with a given level of quality, will be accepted. In on-line sampling inspection, the probability of acceptance of any portion of production depends on the sample results obtained from the preceding portions. The probability of acceptance values associated with these procedures are the values which would be expected if a large number of sample units are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans referenced in these procedures, the probability of acceptance at the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting value ("S") associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the probability of acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic inspection period as close as possible to 95 percent.

(c) Terms applicable to lot inspection only.
