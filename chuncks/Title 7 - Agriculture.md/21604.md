######## Services prior to loading.

(c)When official sampling, official inspection, and Class X weighing or checkweighing of sacked export grain is performed prior to the date of loading aboard an export carrier, official "OUT" certificates shall be issued. An examination by official personnel for condition and checkloading of the grain shall be made as the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier. If the examination for condition and the checkloading shows that the identity or quantity of the grain has not changed or the condition of the grain has not changed beyond expected variations prescribed in the instruction, official export inspection and weight certificates shall be issued on the basis of the official "OUT" certificates and the checkloading. If the identity, quantity, or the condition has changed, official export inspection and weight certificates shall be issued on the basis of the most representative samples, including weight samples, obtained at the time the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier.
