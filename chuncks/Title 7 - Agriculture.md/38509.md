######## Development on Scattered Sites and in Subdivisions.

II.-A. General. Scattered sites and subdivision developments will be planned and constructed in accordance with specific requirements of this subpart, subpart C of part 1924, and 7 CFR part 1970, and the applicable Agency/MPS or Model Building Codes acceptable to the Agency. Manufactured homes for development in a manufactured home community shall:

1. Be erected with or without a basement on a site-built permanent foundation that meets or exceeds applicable requirements of the Agency/MPS for One- and Two-Family Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to the Agency;

2. Be permanently attached to that foundation by anchoring devices adequate to resist all loads identified in the Agency adopted MPS (this includes resistance to ground movements, seismic shaking, potential shearing, overturning and uplift loads caused by wind, etc.);

3. Have had the towing hitch or running gear, which includes tongues, axles, brakes, wheels, lights and other parts of the chassis that operate only during transportation removed;

4. Have any crawl space beneath the manufactured home properly ventilated and enclosed by a continuous permanent perimeter enclosure. If it is not the supporting foundation, designed to resist all forces to which it may be subject without transmitting to the building superstructure movements or any effects caused by frost heave, soil settlement (consolidation), or shrinking or swelling of expansive soils; and be constructed of materials that conform to Agency adopted MPS requirements for foundations;

5. Have the manufactured home insulated to meet the energy conserving requirements contained in exhibit D of this subpart;

6. Have a manufactured home site, site improvements, and all other features of the mortgaged property not addressed by the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, meet or exceed applicable requirements of this subpart and subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter, the Agency adopted MPS except paragraph 31-2.2 or a Model Building Code acceptable to the Agency;

7. Have had the manufactured unit itself braced and stiffened where necessary before it leaves the factory to eliminate racking and potential damage during transportation; and

8. Be eligible for financing in accordance with the requirements of either section 502, or section 515 of the Agency's Housing Program, for which purpose the beginning of construction will be the commencement of on-site work even though the manufactured home itself may have been produced and temporarily stored prior to the date of application for financing.
