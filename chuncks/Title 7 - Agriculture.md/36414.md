##### ยง 1755.903 Fiber optic service entrance cables.
###### Multimode optical fiber cable.,Attenuation coefficient performance requirement (dB/km),,, Multimode bandwidth coefficient performance requirements (MHz-km,, Points discontinuity acceptance criteria (d),

(2)Unless otherwise specified by the end user, the optical performance of the fibers in a finished cable must comply with Table 8.1,Table 8.2), and Table 8.3of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(c)).

(3) Because the accuracy of attenuation measurements for single mode fibers becomes questionable when measured on short cable lengths, attenuation measurements are to be made utilizing characterization cable lengths. Master Cable reels must be tested and the attenuation values measured will be used for shorter ship lengths of cable.

(4) Because the accuracy of attenuation measurements for multimode fibers becomes questionable when measured on short cable lengths, attenuation measurements are to be made utilizing characterization cable lengths. If the ship length of cable is less than one kilometer, the attenuation values measured on longer lengths of cable (characterization length of cable) before cutting to the ship lengths of cable may be applied to the ship lengths.
