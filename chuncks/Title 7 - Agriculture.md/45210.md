####### Construction contingency reserve.

A cash reserve of at least two percent of the construction contract, inclusive of the contractor's fee and all hard and soft costs that must be set up and fully funded by the closing of the construction loan. This reserve will be held by the lender, and funds will only be disbursed for change order requests approved by the Agency and the lender. Unused funds from the construction contingency reserve will be held in the operating and maintenance reserve and cannot be released to the borrower until the project reaches an occupancy of 90% for 90 consecutive days. In addition the reserve accounts established in the conditional commitment must be fully funded prior to the release of the construction contingency reserve. These requirements remain in effect regardless of whether the lender has established a lease-up reserve in lieu of the occupancy requirement.
