######## Deferred loss payable clause.

(v)This clause provides that, if the amount payable under the policy for any loss to any building insured shall be in excess of a specified portion, (usually 60 percent) of the amount of insurance on such building, the company will withhold from its initial loss payment any sum in excess of the specified portion of the amount of insurance on such building. If the building sustaining such loss is repaired or replaced within six months from the date of the fire and at or within 300 feet of the original location, as described in the policy, the company upon receipt of evidence to that effect from the insured will pay the full balance withheld from the initial payment, provided the amount expended in repairing or replacing the building damaged or destroyed will equal or exceed the amount of loss as determined under the terms of the policy. Failure to repair or replace any insured building within the time and manner provided will constitute acceptance of the initial payment as full and final settlement under the policy with respect to the loss. This clause may be accepted if the amount of insurance is for the full depreciated replacement value (actual cash value) of the building and the unpaid balance of the loan and any prior lien(s) is not greater than the initial loss payment made by the company.
