(a)The Committee may permit any producer to sell dates from such producer's own production free of the requirements of §§ 987.41, 987.45, 987.48, and 987.72 when sold directly to consumers through a roadside stand or date shop owned or operated by the producer within 25 miles of the city limits of Indio, California, through shipments by parcel post or express, or by certified producers at certified farmers' markets, as these terms are defined by the State of California.

If the producer fails to comply with this agreement, the Committee may revoke any or all exemptions granted the producer.
