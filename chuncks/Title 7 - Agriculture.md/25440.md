####### ยง 984.52 Processing of shelled walnuts.

(a) No handler shall slice, chop, grind, or in any manner change the form of shelled walnuts unless such walnuts have been certified as merchantable or unless such walnuts meet quality regulations established under ยง 984.50(d) if such regulations are in effect.

(b) Any lot of shelled walnuts which, upon inspection, fails to meet the minimum standard effective pursuant to ยง 984.50 solely due to excess shriveling may be certified for processing provided that the total amount of shrivel does not exceed 20 percent, by weight, of the lot. All such walnuts must be reinspected after processing and shall be certified as merchantable if the processed material meets the effective minimum standard. The provisions of this paragraph may be modified by the Secretary, upon recommendation of the Board or other information.

(c) The Board shall establish such procedures as are necessary to insure that all such walnuts are inspected prior to being placed into the current of commerce.
