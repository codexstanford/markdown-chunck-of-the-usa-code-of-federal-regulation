####### Time extensions.

(1)The Agency may extend the 4-year grant time limit if the Agency determines, at its sole discretion, that the grantee is unable to complete the project for reasons beyond the grantee's control and that the grantee has established an active jobs accelerator and related programming. Grantees must submit a request for the no-cost extension no later than 90 days before the expiration date of the Financial Assistance Agreement. This request must describe the extenuating circumstances that were beyond its control to complete the project for which the grant was awarded, elements of completion that are required and their timeframe, and why an approval is in the government's best interest. The Agency may extend the grant term up to an additional two-year period. Additional extensions will not be granted.
