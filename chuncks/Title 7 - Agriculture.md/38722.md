####### ยง 1927.54 Requirements for closing agents.
######## Approval of title companies.

(d)A title company acting as a closing agent, or as an issuing agent for a title insurance company, must be covered by a title insurance company closing protection letter or submit an agency form certifying to fidelity coverage to cover all employees having access to the loan funds. The agency will determine the appropriate level of such coverage and will approve the form stipulating the bond coverage. Delay in providing closing services without justification may be a basis for not approving the company in future cases. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their approved title companies that are covered by its closing protection letter to the State Office and, in such cases the title companies on the list are approved for closings for that title insurance company.
