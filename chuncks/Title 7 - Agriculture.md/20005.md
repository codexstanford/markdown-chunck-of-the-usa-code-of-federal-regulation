######## Cash flow budget

is a projection listing all anticipated cash inflows (including all farm income, nonfarm income and all loan advances) and all cash outflows (including all farm and nonfarm debt service and other expenses) to be incurred during the period of the budget. Advances and principal repayments of lines of credit may be excluded from a cash flow budget. Cash flow budgets for guaranteed loans under $125,000 do not require income and expenses itemized by categories. A cash flow budget may be completed either for a 12-month period, a typical production cycle, or the life of the loan, as appropriate. It may also be prepared with a breakdown of cash inflows and outflows for each month of the review period and include the expected outstanding operating credit balance for the end of each month. The latter type is referred to as a "monthly cash flow budget."
