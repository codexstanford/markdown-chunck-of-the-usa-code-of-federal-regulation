######### (C) classification.

(c)If the frozen red tart pitted cherries possess a fairly good red color, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). "Fairly good red color" means that the frozen cherries possess a color that is fairly bright and typical of properly ripened cherries and that is fairly uniform in that the number of cherries that vary markedly from this color due to oxidation, improper processing, or other causes, or that are undercolored, does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
