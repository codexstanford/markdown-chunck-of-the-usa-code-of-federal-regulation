####### ยง 97.20 Abandonment for failure to respond within the time limit.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in ยง 97.104, if an applicant fails to advance actively his or her application within 30 days after the date when the last request for action was mailed to the applicant by the Office, or within such longer time as may be fixed by the Commissioner, the application shall be deemed abandoned. The filing and examination fees in such cases will not be refunded.

(b) The submission of an amendment to the application, not responsive to the last request by the Office for action, and any proceedings relative thereto, shall not operate to save the application from abandonment.

The Commissioner may set a period, not less than 30 days, to correct any deficiency in the application.
