###### ยง 989.701 Minimum grade and condition standards for natural condition raisins.
####### Provided,

Effective pursuant to ยง 989.58, raisins meeting the varietal standards hereinafter set forth shall be considered as standard raisins and those failing to meet such standards shall be considered as off-grade raisins. Where the raisins in any lot consist of two or more varietal types commingled within their containers, the lot shall be considered as a mixed lot and as standard raisins if they meet for each defect the most restrictive requirements for the varietal types of raisins comprising the lot. In the event layered Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or Cluster Seedless raisins are commingled within their containers with loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or loose Cluster Seedless raisins respectively, the entire lot shall be considered as loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. The raisins shall be considered as standard raisins if the lot as a whole meets the minimum standards for loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins:That with respect to the requirements peculiar to a varietal type such as possessing characteristic color, flavor, or odor, the raisins shall be considered as meeting such requirements if they have been properly prepared as raisins. In each category, only those raisins which have been properly dried and cured in original natural condition, are free from active infestation, and are in such condition that they are capable of being received, stored, and packed without undue deterioration or spoilage, shall be considered as storable raisins.
