######## Harvested

means:

(1) For insured crops, harvested as defined according to the applicable crop insurance policy;

(2) For NAP covered single harvest crops, that a crop has been removed from the field, either by hand or mechanically, or by grazing of livestock;

(3) For NAP covered crops with potential multiple harvests in 1 year or harvested over multiple years, that the producer has, by hand or mechanically, removed at least one mature crop from the field during the crop year;

(4) For mechanically-harvested NAP covered crops, that the crop has been removed from the field and placed in a truck or other conveyance, except hay is considered harvested when in the bale, whether removed from the field or not. Grazed land will not be considered harvested for the purpose of determining an unharvested or prevented planting payment factor. A crop that is intended for mechanical harvest, but subsequently grazed and not mechanically harvested, will have an unharvested factor applied.
