###### Armor (optional).

(j)(1) A steel armor, plastic coated on both sides, is recommended for direct buried service entrance cable in gopher areas. Armor is also optional for duct and aerial cable as required by the end user. The plastic coated steel armor must be applied longitudinally directly over the core wrap or the intermediate jacket and must have an overlapping edge.

(2) The uncoated steel tape must be electrolytic chrome coated steel (ECCS) with a thickness of 0.155 +/-0.015 millimeters.

(3) The reduction in thickness of the armoring material due to the corrugating or application process must be kept to a minimum and must not exceed 10 percent at any spot.

(4) The armor of each length of cable must be electrically continuous with no more than one joint or splice allowed per kilometer of cable. This requirement does not apply to a joint or splice made in the raw material by the raw material manufacturer.

(5) The breaking strength of any section of an armor tape, containing a factory splice joint, must not be less than 80 percent of the breaking strength of an adjacent section of the armor of equal length without a joint.

(6) For cables containing no floodant over the armor, the overlap portions of the armor tape must be bonded in cables having a flat, non-corrugated armor to meet the requirements of paragraphs (r)(1) and (r)(2) of this section. If the tape is corrugated, the overlap portions of the armor must be sufficiently bonded and the corrugations must be sufficiently in register to meet the requirements of paragraphs (r)(1) and (r)(2) of this section.

(7) The armor tape must be so applied as to enable the cable to meet the testing requirements of paragraphs (r)(1) and (r)(2) of this section.

(8) The protective coating on the steel armor must meet the Bonding-to-Metal, Heat Sealability, Lap-Shear and Moisture Resistance requirements of Type I, Class 2 coated metals per ASTM B 736 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(d)).

(9) When the jacket is bonded to the plastic coated armor, the bond between the plastic coated armor and the outer jacket must not be less than 525 Newtons per meter over at least 90 percent of the cable circumference when tested per ASTM D 4565 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(d)). For cables with strength members embedded in the jacket, and residing directly over the armor, the area of the armor directly under the strength member is excluded from the 90 percent calculation.
