(1)If program property has not sold after being actively marketed at the current appraised value for 45 days during which time program applicants have exclusive rights to purchase the property, plus an additional 30 days to any offeror, the price will be administratively reduced by 10 percent of the appraised value. During the first 45 days after the price reduction, the property will be actively marketed with program applicants having exclusive rights to purchase the property, and at the expiration of this 45-day period, the property may be sold to any offeror. If at the end of this 75-day period the property remains unsold, a second price reduction of 10 percent of the appraised value will be made. During the first 45 days after the second price reduction, the property will be actively marketed with program applicants having exclusive rights to purchase the property, and at the expiration of this 45-day period, the property may be sold to any offeror. If the property does not sell within 75 days of the second price reduction, further guidance is provided in ยง 1955.114(a)(6) and Exhibit D (available in any Rural Development office) of this subpart.
