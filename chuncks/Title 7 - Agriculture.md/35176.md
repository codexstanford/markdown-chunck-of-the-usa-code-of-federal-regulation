(i)(1) The borrower is responsible for meeting all requirements necessary to issue private lender notes and to accommodate the lien of the Government mortgage to secure the private lender notes including, but not limited to, those of the private lender, of any other mortgagees secured under the existing RUS mortgage, and of any governmental entities with jurisdiction over the issuance of notes or the execution and delivery of the supplemental mortgage.

(2) To the extent that the borrower's existing mortgage requires RUS approval before the borrower can make an investment in an affiliated company, approval is hereby given for all investments made in affiliated companies with the proceeds of private lender notes qualifying for an automatic lien accommodation under paragraph (e) of this section. Any reference to an approval by RUS under the mortgage shall apply only to the rights of RUS and not to any other party.
