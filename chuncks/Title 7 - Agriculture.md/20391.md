####### Agency approval of the liquidation plan.

(c)(1) CLP lender's or standard eligible lender's liquidation plan, and any revisions of the plan, must be approved by the Agency.

(2) If, within 20 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the liquidation plan, the Agency fails to approve it or fails to request that the lender make revisions, the lender may assume the plan is approved. The lender may then proceed to begin liquidation actions at its discretion as long as it has been at least 60 days since the borrower's eligibility for interest assistance was considered.

(3) At its option, the Agency may liquidate the guaranteed loan as follows:

(i) Upon Agency request, the lender will transfer to the Agency all rights and interests necessary to allow the Agency to liquidate the loan. The Agency will not pay the lender for any loss until after the collateral is liquidated and the final loss is determined; and

(ii) If the Agency conducts the liquidation, interest accrual will cease on the date the Agency notifies the lender in writing that it assumes responsibility for the liquidation.
