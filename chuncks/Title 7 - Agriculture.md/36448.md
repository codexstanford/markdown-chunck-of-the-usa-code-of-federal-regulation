###### Low temperature durability.

(v)Low temperature durability shall be proven by exposing the three test panels from (e)(3)(iv) of this section to at least 25 continuous cycles of the following test sequence:

(A) To insure complete saturation of the three test panels, soak them for 96 hours in a container of distilled water 22+/-2 &#xB0;C (71.6+/-4 &#xB0;F);

(B) Lower the temperature of the water and the immersed test panels to -28+/-2 &#xB0;C (-18.4+/-4 &#xB0;F) and stabilize for 24 hours;

(C) Thaw the water with the samples to 22+/-2 &#xB0;C (71.6+/-4 &#xB0;F) and stabilize for 24 hours;

(D) Repeat the procedure 24 times. Any cracking, crazing, deforming, or delaminating on any of the three test panels shall be considered a failure; and

(E) Remove the samples from the water and impact test the three panels by delivering a force of 11.3 N-m (100 lb-in.) using a Gardner-Impact Tester to each specimen at 71, 22, and -28+/-2 &#xB0;C (159.8, 71.6, and -18.4+/-4 &#xB0;F), after stabilizing them at those temperatures for at least two hours. Visual inspection shall reveal no deformation or perforations on any of the test panels.
