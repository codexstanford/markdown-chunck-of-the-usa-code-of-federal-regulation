####### Final loss claim.

(e)Except for certain unsecured personal or corporate guarantees as provided for in this section, the lender must submit a final report of loss to the Agency within 30 calendar days after liquidation of all collateral is completed. The Agency will not guarantee interest beyond the interest termination date or this 30-day period, other than for the period of time it takes the Agency to process the loss claim. The lender must apply the total amount of the loss payment remitted by the Agency to the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. At the time of final loss settlement, the lender must notify the borrower that the loss payment has been so applied. Such application does not release the borrower from liability. Once the lender receives a final loss payment from the Agency, the Agency will collect any outstanding debts owed to the government in accordance with part 3 of this title.
