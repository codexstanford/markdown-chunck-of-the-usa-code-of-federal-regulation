####### Procurement procedures.

(b)(1) It is the responsibility of each borrower to determine the procurement method that best meets its needs to award contracts in amounts of less than $5,000,000 each.

(2) If the amount of the contract is $5,000,000 or more or if the contract requires RUS approval, the borrower must use formal or informal competitive bidding to award the contract.

(3) Where formal or informal competitive bidding is not applicable, or does not result in a responsive bid, multiparty negotiation may be used only after RUS approval is obtained.
