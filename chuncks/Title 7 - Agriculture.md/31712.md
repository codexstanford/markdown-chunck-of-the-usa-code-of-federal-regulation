######## Agricultural uses

means those activities defined by a State's farm or ranch land protection program or where no program exists, by the State agricultural use tax assessment program. However, if NRCS determines that a State definition of agricultural use is so broad that an included use would constitute a violation of Federal law, limit future agricultural viability, degrade soils or the agricultural nature of the land or the related natural resources, NRCS reserves the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property to be subject to an agricultural land easement. These deed restrictions would narrow the State definition of agricultural use in order to meet Federal law, or to protect soils, the agricultural nature of the land, or related natural resources.
