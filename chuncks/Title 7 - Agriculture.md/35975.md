###### Frequency stability.

(v)At ambient temperature of 70 &#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;F (21 &#xB0; +/-0.3 &#xB0;C), for any combination of capacitive power factor of 0.8, inductive power factor of 0.5, and resistive loads with variations in input battery ranging from 44 to 56 volts, the output frequency shall not vary more than +/-1/3 Hz or +/-1 percent, whichever is less stringent. At temperatures between 15 &#xB0;F (4 &#xB0;C) to 130 &#xB0;F (54 &#xB0;C), and for any combination of resistive load and variations in input battery ranging from 44-56 volts, the output frequency shall not vary more than +/-1/3 Hz or +/-1 percent, whichever is less stringent.
