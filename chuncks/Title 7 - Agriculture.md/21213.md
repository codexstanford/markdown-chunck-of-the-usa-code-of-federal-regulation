###### ยง 785.7 Distribution of Federal grant funds.
####### Period of availability of funds.

(e)(1) States receiving Certified Mediation Program grant funds are encouraged to obligate award funds within the Federal fiscal year of the award. A State may, however, carry forward any funds disbursed to its Certified Mediation Program that remain unobligated at the end of the fiscal year of award for use in the next fiscal year for costs resulting from obligations in the subsequent funding period. Any carryover balances plus any additional obligated fiscal year grant will not exceed the lesser of 70 percent of the State's budgeted allowable costs of operation and administration of the State's Certified Mediation Program for the subsequent fiscal year, or $500,000.

(2) Grant funds not spent in accordance with this part will be subject to de-obligation and must be returned to the USDA.
