##### ยง 1752.28 Interest accrual.

(a) The Agency may determine to stop accruing interest if the account has remained delinquent for a period of 18 months or more, and the Agency has determined, in its sole discretion, that it will not recover the full outstanding principal balance on the loan.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator may waive the accrual of interest on any outstanding delinquent debt, if in the sole determination of the Administrator, such waiver facilitates and maximizes the Government's recovery of the debt, such as under a voluntary foreclosure by the Borrower.
