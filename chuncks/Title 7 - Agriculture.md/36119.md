(m)-(1)(i) The average mutual capacitance (corrected for length) of all pairs in any reel must not exceed 52 +/-4 nanofarad/ kilometer (nF/km) (83 +/-7 nanofarad/mile (nF/mile)) when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a frequency of 1.0 +/-0.1 kilohertz (kHz) and a temperature of 23 +/-3 &#xB0;C.

(ii) The mutual conductance (corrected for length and gauge) of any pair must not exceed 2 micromhos/kilometer (micromhos/km) (3.3 micromhos/mile) when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4566-90 at a frequency of 1.0 +/-0.1 kHz and a temperature of 23 +/-3 &#xB0;C.
