####### § 1412.73 Reconstitutions of farms and election.

(a) If a new producer or new owner gains an interest in a farm after the filing of a valid election on that farm during the election period, that new producer or new owner, whether or not known to FSA or the other producers or owners on the farm, will be subject to any previously submitted valid election under §§ 1412.71 and 1412.72 unless that new producer or new owner modifies, rescinds, or terminates the election as a producer or owner as specified in § 1412.72(c) during the remaining time in the election period.

(b) Any reconstitution request initiated after August 1, 2019, will not be made until after the end of the election period specified in § 1412.72. Following the close of the election period in § 1412.72, a valid election on any farm cannot be changed by any reconstitution. This means that valid elected farms can only be combined with farms having an identical election for each and every covered commodity on the farm regardless of whether there are any base acres for any and all covered commodities on the farm. Reconstitutions will not be permitted to alter a valid election or the default election that may apply to a farm.
