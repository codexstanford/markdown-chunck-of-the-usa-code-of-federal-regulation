###### Offer of proof.

(7)Whenever evidence is excluded by the Judge, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript or recording in toto. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record. In either event, the evidence shall be considered a part of the transcript or recording and hearing record if the Judicial Officer, upon appeal, decides the Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial. If the Judicial Officer decides the Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial and that it would be inappropriate to have such evidence considered a part of the hearing record, the Judicial Officer may direct that the hearing be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence or for any other purpose in connection with the excluded evidence.
