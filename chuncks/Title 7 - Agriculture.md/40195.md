######## Reasonable rates and terms.

Those commercial rates and terms which borrowers are expected to meet when borrowing for similar purposes and similar periods of time. The "similar periods of time" of available commercial loans will be measured against, but need not be the same as, the remaining or original term of the loan. In the case of Multi-Family Housing (MFH) loans, "reasonable rates and terms" would be considered to mean financing that would allow the units to be offered to eligible tenants at rates consistent with other multi-family housing.
