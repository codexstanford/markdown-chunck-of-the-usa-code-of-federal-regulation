####### Regulated fields.

(d)The Administrator will classify a field or area as a regulated area when:

(1) It is a field planted with seed from a lot found to contain a bunted wheat kernel; or

(2) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that was found during survey to contain a bunted wheat kernel (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to a field found during survey to contain a bunted kernel); or

(3) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that has been determined to be associated with grain at a handling facility containing a bunted kernel of a host crop (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to the field associated with the bunted kernel at the handling facility).
