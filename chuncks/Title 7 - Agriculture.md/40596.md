######### Exclusive broker contract.

(1)An exclusive broker contract provides for the selection of one broker by competitive negotiation who will be the only authorized broker for the Rural Development office awarding the contract within a defined area and for specific property or type of property. Criteria will be specified in the solicitation together with a numerical weighting system to be used (usually 1-100). Responses will be calculated on the basis of the criteria such as personal qualifications, membership in Multiple Listing Service (MLS), previous experience with Rural Development sales, advertising plans, proposed innovative promotion methods, and financial capability. The responsibilities of the broker under an exclusive broker contract exceed those of the open listing agreement and therefore, an exclusive broker contract is the preferred method of listing properties.
