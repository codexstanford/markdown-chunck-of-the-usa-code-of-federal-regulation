####### Unemployment (maximum 15 points).

(6)The Agency will award points under this criterion based on the extent to which the unemployment rate in the intermediary's service area exceeds the national unemployment rate. For unemployment computations, applicant intermediaries must use the unemployment data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, for the most current month available at the time of application in comparison to the national unemployment rate for the same month. If the service area is a single city, town, or Indian Reservation and current, monthly unemployment data is not available for that city or town, the current, monthly unemployment rate for the county (or Indian Reservation) in which the service area is located should be used. For applicant intermediaries whose service area includes multiple locations or geographic areas, a weighted average based on the populations should be used in calculating the area's unemployment rate. If the unemployment rate in the intermediary's service area is:

(i) Equal to, or less than 25 percent above the national unemployment rate, 5 points will be awarded;

(ii) At least 25 percent above, but less than 50 percent above the national unemployment rate, 10 points will be awarded; or

(iii) Fifty percent or more above the national unemployment rate, 15 points will be awarded.
