###### Probable causes for nonconformance.

(9)Some of the more common causes for failing to obtain the desired results may be due to reversed load coil windings, missing load coils, bridge taps between load coils, load coil spacing irregularities, excessive end sections, cables having high or low mutual capacitance, load coils inadvertently installed in nonloaded loops, moisture or water in the cable, load coils having the wrong inductance, split pairs, and improperly spliced connectors. The above can occur singularly or in combination. Experience to date indicates that the most common problems are missing load coils, reversed load coil windings or bridge taps.
