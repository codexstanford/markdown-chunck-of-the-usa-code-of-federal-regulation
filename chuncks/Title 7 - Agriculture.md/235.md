###### Use of deposition.

(g)A deposition ordered and taken in accordance with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under these rules if the Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and (1) that the witness is dead; (2) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; (3) that the party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena, but has been unable to do so; or (4) that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If the party upon whose motion the deposition was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the deposition or any part thereof in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.
