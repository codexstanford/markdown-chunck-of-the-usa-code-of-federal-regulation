The exporter warrants that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure the financing agreement on an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty, CCC shall have the right, without limitation on any other rights it may have, to annul the financing agreement without liability to CCC.

Such amounts shall, on demand, be refunded to CCC by the exporter.
