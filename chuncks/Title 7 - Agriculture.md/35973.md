(iii)(A) The output voltage for resistive, capacitive power factor of 0.8, and inductive power factor of 0.5 loads from no load to full rated output with 52.1 volts input battery shall not vary more than +/-3 percent from the output voltage measured atrated output, 1.0 power factor with 52.1 volts dc input applied.

(B) The output voltage for resistive, capacitive power factor of 0.8, and inductive power factor of 0.5 from no load to full rated output with input battery variations between 48-56 volts dc shall not vary more than +/-10 percent from the output voltage measured atrated output and 1.0 power factor with 52.1 volts dc input applied.

(C) The output voltage for resistive, capacitive power factor of 0.8, and inductive power factor of 0.5 loads from no load to full rated output and with input battery variations between 44-56 volts dc shall not vary more than + 10/-15 percent from the output voltage measured atrated output and 1.0 power factor with 52.1 volts dc input applied.
