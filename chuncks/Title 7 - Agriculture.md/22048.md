######## Conflicts.

(c)In addition to the conflicts of interest prohibited by section 11 of the Act, the activities specified in this paragraph shall also be considered to be a conflict of interest. Accordingly, no official personnel shall, during the term of their license or authorization (including any period of suspension):

(1) Accept any gratuity.

(2) Accept any fee or charge or other thing of monetary value, in addition to the published fee or charge, for the performance of official inspection or weighing services under circumstances in which the acceptance could result, or create the appearance of resulting, in (i) the use of their office or position for undue private gain, (ii) an undertaking to give undue preferential treatment to any group or any person, or (iii) any other loss of independence or impartiality in the performance of official inspection or Class X or Class Y weighing services.

(3) Knowingly perform, or participate in performing, an inspection or weighing service on grain in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest.

(4) Engage in the business by buying, selling, transporting, cleaning, elevating, storing, binning, mixing, blending, drying, treating, fumigating, or other preparation of grain (other than a grower of grain, or in the disposition of inspection samples); or in the business of cleaning, treating, or fitting carriers or containers for transporting or storing grain; the merchandising for nonfarm use of equipment for cleaning, drying, treating, fumigating, or otherwise processing, handling, or storing grain; or the merchandising of grain inspection or weighing equipment (other than buying or selling by official personnel of the equipment for use in the performance of their official services).

(5) Seek or hold any appointive or elective office in a grain industry organization or association. This provision does not apply to organizations of official inspectors or official weighers.

(6) Participate in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of corporate stocks or bonds, grain or grain-related commodities, or other property for speculative or income purposes if the transaction could reasonably be construed to interfere with the proper and impartial performance of official inspection for Class X or Class Y weighing services. Official personnel are not prohibited from (i) producing grain as a grower and selling the grain; (ii) making bona fide investments in governmental obligations, banking institutions, savings and loan associations, and other tangibles and intangibles that are clearly not involved in the production, transportation, storage, marketing, or processing of grain; or (iii) borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms.
