When information is received that a borrower is entering the armed forces, the County Supervisor will be responsible for contacting the borrower immediately for the purpose of reaching an understanding concerning the actions to take in connection with the government loan indebtedness. The borrower will be permitted to retain the chattel security if arrangements can be worked out which are satisfactory to the borrower and Rural Development. However, because of the nature of chattel security, the borrower will be informed of the usual depreciation of such property and will be encouraged to sell the property and apply the proceeds to the loan(s). In most cases, the interests of both the borrower and the Government can best be served by arranging for a voluntary sale of the security. A borrower retaining security will be expected to make payments on the loan(s) equal to the scheduled payments.
