######## Preapplication review.

(2)Upon receipt of the preapplication, RD will tentatively determine eligibility including the likelihood of credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms and availability of agency loan funds. The determination as to availability of other credit will be made after considering present rates and terms available for similar proposals (not necessarily based upon rates and terms available from Rural Development); the repayment potential of the applicant; long-term cost to the applicant; and average user or other charges. In those cases where Rural Development determines that loans at reasonable rates and terms should be available from commercial sources, Rural Development will notify the applicant so that it may apply for such financial assistance. Such applicants may be reconsidered for Rural Development loans upon their presenting satisfactory evidence of inability to obtain commercial financing at reasonable rates and terms.
