####### ยง 1430.102 Definitions.
######## Dairy operation

means a dairy operation as defined pursuant to the criteria and procedures under the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program or any dairy facility that was part of a single dairy operation that participated in the MILC Program as of February 7, 2014. Operations that are determined to be "new operations" under this subpart, will be subject to the "affiliation" test under ยง 1430.103(e) if the operation elects to participate in MPP-Dairy separately. A single dairy operation operated by more than one dairy producer will be treated as a single dairy operation for purposes of participating in MPP-Dairy and can only submit one application. All dairy operations under this part shall commercially market milk produced from cows as a single unit located in the United States in which each dairy producer:

(1) Has risk in the production of milk in the dairy operation; and

(2) Makes contributions, including land, labor, management, equipment, or capital, to the dairy operation at least commensurate to the producers' share of the operation.
