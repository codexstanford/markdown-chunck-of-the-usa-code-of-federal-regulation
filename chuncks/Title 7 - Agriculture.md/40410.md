######## Nonprogram (NP) property.

SFH and MFH property acquired pursuant to the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, that cannot be used by a borrower to effectively carry out the objectives of the respective loan program; for example, a dwelling that cannot be feasibly repaired to meet the requirements for existing housing as described in 7 CFR part 3550. It may contain a structure which would meet program standards; however, is so remotely located it would not serve as an adequate residential unit or an older house which is excessively expensive to heat and/or maintain for a very-low or low-income homeowner.
