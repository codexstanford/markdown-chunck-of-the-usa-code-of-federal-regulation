####### Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

(1) That such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services; or

(2) In the case of regulatory liabilities, that refunds to customers, not provided for in the other accounts, will be required.
