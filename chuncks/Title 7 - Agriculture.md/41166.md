######## Applications from cooperatives.

(b)Borrowers eligible for loans from the Bank for Cooperatives will be encouraged to obtain guaranteed loans from that source since the Bank for Cooperatives is experienced in making and servicing such loans and can provide substantial counsel to the applicant. Applications must be submitted to the Bank for Cooperatives as a test for credit elsewhere when an insured loan is being considered.
