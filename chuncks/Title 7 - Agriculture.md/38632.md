######## Percolation Tests

2.-a. Percolation tests are required unless a waiver is granted by the National Office. Waivers may be granted on a statewide or local basis in cases where an onsite evaluation of soils would be performed by a qualified soil technician, soil scientist, or engineer. Requests for waivers must describe the qualifications of the person evaluating the soils and discuss the criteria to be used in designing the absorption system.

b. In uniform soils one percolation test shall be made within each area proposed for an absorption system. If significant soil variations are encountered or expected, additional tests shall be made for each variation.

c. Percolation tests shall be conducted in accordance with good practice. Guidance for performing these tests is included in the EPA design manual, "Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems."
