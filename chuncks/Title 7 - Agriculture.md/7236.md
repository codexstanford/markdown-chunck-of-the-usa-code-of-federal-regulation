######### ยง 58.809 Pasteurization.

(a) All fluid whey used in the manufacture of dry whey, dry whey products, modified whey products, and lactose shall be pasteurized prior to condensing. When the condensing and drying operations for dry whey take place at the same plant, the pasteurization may be located at a different point in the operation provided it will protect the quality of the finished product and not adversely affect the processing procedure.

(b) Pasteurized products transported to another plant for final processing shall be repasteurized, except that condensed whey containing 40 percent or more solids may be transported to another plant for further processing into dry whey, dry whey products or lactose without repasteurization.

(c) If whey is transferred to another plant for further processing, or if during the processing procedure unpasteurized ingredients are added (except those necessary for lactose crystallization), or processing procedures permit contamination or bacterial growth, the whey shall be repasteurized as close to the final drying operations as possible.
