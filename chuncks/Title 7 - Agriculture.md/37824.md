######## Effective date of insurance.

(9)If there are insurable buildings located on the property, the borrower will arrange with his agent or company to have adequate insurance in force at the time the loan, assumption, or credit sale is closed so that the policy will properly insure the borrower and the mortgagees. When new buildings are erected or major improvements are made to existing buildings, such insurance will be made effective as of the date materials are delivered to the property. The County Supervisor will make no payments from loan funds for labor or materials until the borrower has furnished adequate insurance to protect the interest of the Agency in the buildings being erected or improved.
