####### Borrower failure or inability to meet insurance requirements.

(c)The Agency will take the following actions in cases where a borrower is unwilling or unable to meet the Agency's insurance requirements:

(1) The Agency will obtain insurance for Agency financed property if the borrower fails to do so. If borrowers refuse to pay the insurance premium, the Agency will pay the insurance premium and charge the premium payment amount to the borrower's Agency account and will place the borrower in default as described in ยง 3560.452(c).

(2) If borrowers habitually fail to pay premiums in a timely manner, the Agency will require borrowers to escrow amounts appropriate to pay insurance premiums.

(3) If insurance that meets the Agency's specified requirements is not available (e.g., flood or hurricane insurance), the Agency may accept the insurance policy that most nearly conforms to established requirements.

(4) If the best insurance policy a borrower can obtain at the time the borrower receives the loan or grant contains a loss deductible clause greater than that allowed by paragraph (f)(9) of this section, the insurance policy and an explanation of the reasons why more adequate insurance is not available must be submitted to the Agency prior to loan or grant approval.
