(a)Applications are accepted in the Rural Development State Office on an ongoing basis. The Agency will review all applications received for eligibility and will score each application according to the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section. Eligible applications received by the Rural Development State Office by close of business on September 30, December 31, March 31, and June 30 of each year will compete based on score ranking for available funds with other applications in that Federal fiscal quarter. If the quarterly application deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, the application deadline will be the next business day. The Agency will rank all eligible, scored applications each Federal fiscal quarter and will fund applications in the order of priority ranking using available funds for that quarter. The Agency will retain unsuccessful applications due to limited funding for consideration in subsequent reviews, through a total of four quarterly reviews.
