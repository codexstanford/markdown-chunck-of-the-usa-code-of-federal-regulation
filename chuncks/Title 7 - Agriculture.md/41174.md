######## Indexation.

(vi)When current, annual data are not available to determine a State's nonmetropolitan household income for purposes of the calculations described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, indexation of census data is necessary. The State Director will use the figure from the most recent decennial census of the United States, increased by a factor representing the increase since the year of that census in the Consumer Price Index ("CIP-U"). That factor shall be furnished annually by the National Office, Rural Development.
