####### ยง 1484.52 Reimbursement rules.

(a) A Cooperator may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:

(1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the performance of an approved activity; and

(2) The Cooperator has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.

(b) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section and ยง 1484.53, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

(1) Production and placement of advertising, including in print, electronic media, billboards, or posters. Electronic media includes, but is not limited to, radio, television, electronic mail, internet, telephone, text messaging, and podcasting;

(2) Production and distribution of banners, recipe cards, table tents, shelf talkers, and similar point of sale materials;

(3) Direct mail advertising;

(4) Food service promotions, product demonstrations to the trade, and distribution of product samples (but not the purchase of the product samples);

(5) Temporary displays and rental of space for temporary displays;

(6) Subject to paragraph (b)(7) of this section, non-travel expenditures, including participation fees, booth construction, transportation of related materials, rental of space and equipment, and duplication of related printed materials, associated with retail and trade exhibits and shows, whether held outside or inside the United States. However, non-travel expenditures associated with retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Cooperator has not participated in within the last three calendar years using funds from a source other than FMD. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:

(i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and

(ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;

(7) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail or trade exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, project funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those Cooperators located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. Upon written request, CCC may temporarily waive this paragraph (b)(7), on a case by case basis, where the trade show is segregated into product pavilions, a company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion, or when a company can demonstrate that there is a benefit to being located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the Cooperator in writing;

(8) Expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with seminars and educational training, whether conducted in the United States or outside the United States, including space rental, equipment rental, and duplication of seminar materials;

(9) Production and distribution of publications;

(10) Demonstrators, interpreters, translators, receptionists, and similar temporary workers who help with the implementation of individual promotional activities, such as trade shows, food service promotions, and trade seminars;

(11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts, and other similar promotional materials, subject to such reimbursement limitation as CCC may determine and announce in writing to Cooperators via a program notice issued on FAS' website. Reimbursement is available only when:

(i) The items are described in detail with a per unit cost in an approved strategic plan; and

(ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the target audience purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item;

(12) Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost of living adjustments paid to U.S. citizen employees or U.S. citizen contractors stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, subject to the limitation that CCC shall not reimburse that portion of:

(i) The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees; or

(ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel;

(13) Foreign transfer, temporary lodging, and post hardship differential allowances for U.S. citizen employees, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies;

(14) Approved salaries or compensation for non-U.S. citizen employees and non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas. Generally, CCC will not reimburse any portion of a non-U.S. citizen employee's compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan applicable to the country in which the employee works. However, if the local FSN salary plan is inappropriate, a Cooperator may request a higher level of reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen in accordance with the annual program announcement;

(15) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process revels that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;

(16) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;

(17) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;

(18) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved FMD-funded overseas offices;

(19) Fees for professional and consultant services;

(20) Subject to paragraph (b)(7) of this section, international travel expenditures, including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail or trade exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Cooperator has not participated in within the last three calendar years using funds from a source other than FMD. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are: A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products, and an international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;

(i) CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the Cooperator shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the Cooperator shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim;
