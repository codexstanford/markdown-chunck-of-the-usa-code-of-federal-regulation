(i) If not a playa, pocosin, or pothole, experienced inundation for 15 consecutive days or more during the growing season or 10 percent of the growing season, whichever is less, in most years (50 percent chance or more), which requisite inundation is determined through:

(A) Observation of wetland hydrology indicators as identified in the local NRCS Field Office Technical Guide;

(B) Procedures identified in State Off-Site Methods for wetland identification set forth in the local NRCS Field Office Technical Guide; or

(C) The use of analytic techniques, such as the use of drainage equations or the evaluation of monitoring data.

(ii) If a playa, pocosin, or pothole experienced ponding for 7 or more consecutive days during the growing season in most years (50-percent chance of more) or saturation for 14 or more consecutive days during the growing season in most years (50-percent chance or more). Wetlands which are found to support wetland hydrology through Step 1 of the wetland determination process in ยง 12.30(c)(7) and application of the procedures described in ยง 12.31(c) will be determined to meet the requisite criteria.
