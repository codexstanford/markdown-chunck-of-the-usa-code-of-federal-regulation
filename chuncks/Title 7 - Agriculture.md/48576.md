###### ยง 5001.517 Liquidation.
####### Decision to liquidate.

(a)A decision to liquidate a loan or proceed otherwise must be made when the lender determines that the default cannot be cured or when the Agency and the lender determine that it is in the best interest of the Agency and the lender to liquidate. The decision to liquidate or proceed otherwise with the borrower must be made as soon as possible when one or more of the following exist:

(1) The loan is 90 calendar days behind on any scheduled payment and the lender and the borrower have not been able to cure the delinquency;

(2) Delaying liquidation will jeopardize full or maximum recovery on the loan; or

(3) The borrower or lender is uncooperative in resolving the problem or the Agency or lender has reason to believe the borrower is not acting in good faith, and immediate liquidation would minimize loss to the Agency.
