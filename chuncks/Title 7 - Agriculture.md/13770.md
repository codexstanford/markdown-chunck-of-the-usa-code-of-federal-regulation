() I do not admit that the facts as presented are correct. However, I have chosen to sign this waiver and understand that a disqualification penalty will result;

(E) The telephone number and, if possible, the name of the person to contact for additional information; and

(F) The fact that the remaining household members, if any, will be held responsible for repayment of the resulting claim.

(iii) The State agency shall develop a waiver of right to an administrative disqualification hearing form which contains the information required by this section as well as the information described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for advance notice of a hearing. However, if the household member is notified of the possibility of waiving his/her right to an administrative disqualification hearing before the State agency has scheduled a hearing, the State agency is not required to notify the household member of the date, time and place of the hearing at that point as required by paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
