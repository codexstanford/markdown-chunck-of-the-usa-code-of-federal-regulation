###### ยง 1780.1 General.

(a) This part outlines the policies and procedures for making and processing direct loans and grants for water and waste projects. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) shall cooperate fully with State and local agencies in making loans and grants to assure maximum support to the State strategy for rural development. Agency officials and their staffs shall maintain coordination and liaison with State agency and substate planning districts.

(b) The income data used in this part to determine median household income must be that which most accurately reflects the income of the service area. The median household income of the service area and the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State will be determined from income data from 5-year income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. If there is reason to believe that the ACS or other Census Bureau data does not accurately represent the median household income within the area to be served, the reasons will be documented and the applicant may furnish, or RD may obtain, additional information regarding such median household income data. Information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, State or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source. The nonmetropolitan median household income of the State may only be updated on a national basis by the RUS National Office. This will be done only when median household income data for the same year for all Bureau of the Census areas is available from the Bureau of the Census or other reliable sources. Bureau of the Census areas would include areas such as: Counties, County Subdivisions, Cities, Towns, Townships, Boroughs, and other places.

(c) RUS debt instruments will require an agreement that if at any time it shall appear to the Government that the borrower is able to refinance the amount of the indebtedness to the Government then outstanding, in whole or in part, by obtaining a loan for such purposes from responsible cooperative or private credit sources, at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the borrower will, upon request of the Government, apply for and accept such loan in sufficient amount to repay the Government and will take all such actions as may be required in connection with such loan.

(d) Funds allocated for use under this part are also for the use of Indian tribes within the State, regardless of whether State development strategies include Indian reservations within the State's boundaries. Native Americans residing on such reservations must have equal opportunity to participate in the benefits of these programs as compared with other residents of the State. Such tribes might not be subject to State and local laws or jurisdiction. However, any requirements of this part that affect applicant eligibility, the adequacy of RUS's security, or the adequacy of service to users of the facility and all other requirements of this part must be met.
