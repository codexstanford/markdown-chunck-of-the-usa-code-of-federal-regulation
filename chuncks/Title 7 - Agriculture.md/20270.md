####### General.

(a)This paragraph (a) specifies the general requirements for guaranteed loan applications:

(1) Lenders must perform at least the same level of evaluation and documentation for a guaranteed loan that the lender typically performs for non-guaranteed loans of a similar type and amount.

(2) The application thresholds in this section apply to any single loan, or package of loans submitted for consideration at any one time. A lender must not split a loan into two or more parts in order to fall below the threshold in order to avoid additional documentation.

(3) The Agency may require lenders with a lender loss rate in excess of the rate for CLP lenders to assemble additional documentation specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
