######## Multiple Family Housing.

(c)Multiple family housing projects shall be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of ยง 1944.215. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the community because they are in close proximity to undesirable influences such as high activity railroad tracks; adjacent to or behind industrial sites; bordering sites or structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary; or bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable. Screening such sites does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and do not have a reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, etc., are not acceptable.
