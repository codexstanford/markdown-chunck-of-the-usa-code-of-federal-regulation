(c)Recipient agencies in child nutrition programs, and those receiving donated foods as charitable institutions, in accordance with ยง 250.67, are not required to store donated foods in a manner that distinguishes them from purchased foods or other foods, or to maintain a separate inventory record of donated foods-they may utilize single inventory management, as defined in ยง 250.2.
