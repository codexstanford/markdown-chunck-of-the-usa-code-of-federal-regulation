######## ยง 1955.145 Land acquisition to effect sale.
######### not

The State Director is authorized to acquire land which is necessary to effect sale of inventory real property. This action must be considered only on a case-by-case basis and may not be undertaken primarily to increase the financial return to the Government through speculation. The State Director's authority under this section maybe redelegated. For MFH and other organization-type loans, prior approval must be obtained from the appropriate Assistant Administrator prior to land acquisition.
