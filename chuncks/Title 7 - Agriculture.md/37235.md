(c)If a single instrument with amortized installments is not legally permissible, use a single instrument providing for installments of principal plus interest accrued on the principal balance. For bonds with semiannual interest and annual principal, the interest is calculated by multiplying the principal balance times the interest rate and dividing this figure by two. Principal installments are to be scheduled so that total combined interest and principal payments closely approximate amortized payments.

(2) The instrument shall contain in substance provisions indicating:

(i) Principal maturities and due dates;

(ii) Regular payments shall be applied first to interest due through the next principal and interest installment due date and then to principal due in chronological order stipulated in the bond; and

(iii) Payments on delinquent accounts will be applied in the following sequence:

(A) Billed delinquent interest;

(B) Past due interest installments;
