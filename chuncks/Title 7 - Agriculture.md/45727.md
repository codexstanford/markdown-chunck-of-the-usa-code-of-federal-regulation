####### Median household income (maximum 15 points).

(5)The Agency will award points under this criterion based on the degree to which the median household income in the service area of the intermediary exceeds the poverty line for a family of four. For applicant intermediaries whose service area includes multiple locations or geographic areas, weighted averages based on the populations will be used in calculating the area's median household income. For median household income computations, applicant intermediaries will use income data from the latest decennial census of the United States, updated according to changes in the consumer price index as published annually by the Agency. The poverty line used will be as defined in section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)), which will be published annually by the Agency. If the median household income in the intermediary's service area exceeds the poverty line for a family of four by:

(i) At least 50 percent, but not more than 75 percent, 5 points will be awarded;

(ii) At least 25 percent, but less than 50 percent, 10 points will be awarded; or

(iii) Below 25 percent, 15 points will be awarded.
