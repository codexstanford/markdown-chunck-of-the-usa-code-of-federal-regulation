####### Designation of additional regulated articles.

(e)An inspector may designate any article as a regulated article by giving written notice of the designation to the owner or person in possession or control of the article. APHIS will implement rulemaking to add articles designated as regulated articles to the definition of regulated article in ยง 319.40-1 if importation of the article appears to present a recurring significant risk of introducing plant pests. Inspectors may designate an article as a regulated article after determining that:

(1) The article was imported in the same container or hold as a regulated article;

(2) Other articles of the same type imported from the same country have been found to carry plant pests; or

(3) The article appears to be contaminated with regulated articles or soil.
