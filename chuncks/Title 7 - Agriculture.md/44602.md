####### Flood or mudslide-prone areas.

(e)(1) The Agency will not approve sites subject to 100-year floods when non-floodplain sites exist. The environmental review process will assess the availability of a reasonable site outside the 100-year floodplain.

(2) Sites located within the 100 year floodplain are not eligible for federal financial assistance unless flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The Agency will complete Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Form 81-93, Standard Flood Hazard Determination, to document the site's location in relation to the floodplain and the availability of insurance under NFIP.
