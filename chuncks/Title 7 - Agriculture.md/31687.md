###### ยง 1467.12 The WRPO development.

(a) The development of the WRPO will be made through the local NRCS representative, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, with consideration of site-specific technical input from FWS and the Conservation District.

(b) The WRPO will specify the manner in which the enrolled land shall be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO will be developed to ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife benefits and wetland functions and values will result. Specifically, the WRPO will consider and address, to the extent practicable, the on-site alternations and the off-site watershed conditions that adversely impact the hydrology and associated wildlife and wetland functions and values. NRCS will review, revise, and supplement the WRPO as needed throughout the duration of the enrollment to ensure that program goals are fully and effectively achieved.
