####### Error

for active cases results when a determination is made by a quality control reviewer that a household which received SNAP benefits during the sample month is ineligible or received an incorrect allotment. Thus, errors in active cases involve dollar loss to either the participant or the government. For negative cases, an "error" means that the reviewer determines that the decision to deny, suspend, or terminate a household was incorrect.
