######## Selection and funding of priority watersheds.

(a)(1) NRCS will prioritize watersheds based on a nationally consistent process using existing natural resource, environmental quality, and agricultural activity data along with other information that may be necessary to efficiently operate the program. The watershed prioritization and identification process will consider several factors, including but not limited to:

(i) Potential of surface and ground water quality to degradation;

(ii) Potential of soil to degradation;

(iii) Potential of grazing land to degradation;

(iv) State or national conservation and environmental issues e.g., location of air non-attainment zones or important wildlife/fisheries habitat; and

(v) Local availability of management tools needed to more efficiently operate the program, such as digital soils information.

(2) Priority watersheds selected, in which producers would be potentially eligible for enrollment, will be announced in the sign-up notice.
