####### Interest credit

means interest earned on balances in advance payment or cushion of credit accounts. Since the periodic installments are established by the terms of the notes, the interest credits cannot serve to change the total amount of each installment; therefore, an amount equal to the interest credits is added to the principal installment due. On receipt of the full installments, amounts equal to the interest credits (the principal offsets) are added to the respective advance payment accounts.
