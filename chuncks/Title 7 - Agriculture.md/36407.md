(l)(1) The outer jacket must provide the cable with a tough, flexible, protective covering which can withstand exposure to sunlight, to atmosphere temperatures and to stresses reasonably expected in normal installation and service.

(2) The jacket must be free from holes, splits, blisters, or other imperfections, and must be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with the best commercial practice.

(3) Jacket materials must meet the stipulations of paragraph 5.4 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at ยง 1755.901(c)), except that the concentration of furnace black does not necessarily need to be initially contained in the raw material and may be added later during the jacket making process. Jacket thickness must have a 0.50 mm minimum thickness over the core or over any radial strength member used as the primary strength element(s), 0.20 mm when not used as the primary strength member, and 0.30 mm over any optional toning elements.
