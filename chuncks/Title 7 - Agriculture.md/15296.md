(a)The Deputy Administrator will list as a regulated area each quarantined State, or portion of a State, in which witchweed has been found or in which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area and generally infested area in accordance with definitions of these terms in ยง 301.80-1. The Deputy Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas (the regulated areas list) on the PPQ website at. The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all regulated areas may also be obtained by request from any local PPQ office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at. After a change is made to the list of regulated areas, APHIS will publish a notice in theinforming the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the regulated areas. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:

(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and

(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of witchweed.
