####### Loan agreement.

(a)As a condition of a loan or loan guarantee under the RE Act, distribution borrowers are normally required to enter into RUS loan agreements pursuant to which the borrower agrees to use RUS standard forms of contracts for construction, procurement, engineering services and architectural services financed in whole or in part by the RUS loan. Normally, this obligation is contained in section 5.16 of the standard distribution loan contract. To comply with the provisions of the loan agreements as implemented by this part, borrowers must use those forms of contract (hereinafter sometimes called "listed contract forms") identified in the List of Required Standard Contract Forms contained in ยง 1724.74(c), except as provided in ยง 1724.70(b). Power Supply borrowers typically execute an indenture and loan contract as well. The terms and conditions of any indenture and loan contract executed by a Power Supply borrower shall govern its obligations with respect to the use of contract forms.
