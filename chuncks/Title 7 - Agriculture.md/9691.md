####### Whole grains

means grains that consist of the intact, ground, cracked, or flaked grain seed whose principal anatomical components-the starchy endosperm, germ and bran-are present in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact grain seed. Whole grain-rich products must conform to FNS guidance to count toward the grains component.
