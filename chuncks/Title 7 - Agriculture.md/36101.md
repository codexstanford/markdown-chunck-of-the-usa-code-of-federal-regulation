###### Core wrap (optional).

(f)(1) When a core wrap is used, it must consist of a layer of nonhygroscopic and nonwicking dielectric material. The wrap must be applied with an overlap.

(2) The core wrap must provide a sufficient heat barrier to prevent visible evidence of conductor insulation deformation or adhesion between conductors, caused by adverse heat transfer during the inner jacketing operation.

(3) If required for manufacturing reasons, white or colored binders of nonhygroscopic and nonwicking material may be applied over the core wrap.

(4) Sufficient filling compound must be applied to the core wrap that voids or air spaces existing between the core and inner side of the core wrap are minimized.
