####### Ineligible service areas,Overlapping service areas.,de minimis

(b)-(1)RUS will not fund more than one project that serves any one given geographic area. Invariably, however, applicants will propose service areas that overlap, varying from smallareas of the territory, but which may be significant with respect to households involved, to larger areas of the service territory, but which may contain few households or businesses, if any. As a result, devising a procedure that will cover every overlap circumstance is not practicable. Nevertheless, it is the agency's intent to make as many eligible applications viable for consideration as possible. That may mean the agency may:

(i) Determine the overlap to be so insignificant that no agency action is necessary;

(ii) Request one or more applications to be revised to eliminate the overlapping territory;

(iii) Choose one application over another given the amount of assistance requested, the number of awards already chosen in the area or State, or the need for the project in the specific area due to other factors; or

(iv) Simply choose the project that scores higher or in the judgement of the agency is more financially feasible.
