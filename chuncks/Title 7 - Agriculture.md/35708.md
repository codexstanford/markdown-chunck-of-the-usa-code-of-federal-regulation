###### Noise.

(ii)The principal objective related to circuit noise (noise-metallic) and the acceptance of new plant is that circuit noise levels be 20 dBrnc or less (decibels above reference noise, C-message weighted (a weighting derived from listening tests, to indicate the relative annoyance or speech impairment by an interfering signal of frequency (f) as heard through a "500-type" telephone set)). For most new, properly installed, plant construction, circuit noise will usually be considerably less than 20 dBrnc unless there are unusually long sections of telephone plant in parallel with electric power facilities and/or power influence of paralleling electric facilities is abnormally high. When circuit noise is 20 dBrnc or less, the loop plant shall be considered acceptable. When measured circuit noise is greater than 20 dBrnc, loop plant shall still be considered acceptable providing circuit balance (power influence reading minus circuit noise readings) is 60 dB or greater and power influence readings are 85 dBrnc or greater. When circuit noise is greater than 20 dBrnc and circuit balance is less than 60 dB and/or power influence is less than 85 dBrnc, loop plant shall not be considered acceptable and the loop plant shall be remedied to make circuit balance equal to or greater than 60 dB.
