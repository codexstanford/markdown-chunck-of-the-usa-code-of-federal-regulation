(b)Sales steps will be the same as for program MFH property as provided in ยง 1955.114(b) of this subpart except that sales must be for cash or on NP terms as set forth in ยง 1955.118 of this subpart. Additionally, if cash offers are received, they will be given first preference by drawing from the cash offers only. If the State Director determines an auction sale should be used to sell NP MFH property, authority to use that method of sale must be requested from the Assistant Administrator, Housing. Inventory files, including information on the acquisition, marketing efforts made, management of the property, other pertinent information, a memorandum covering the facts of the case, and recommendations of the State Director must be submitted for review. If the housing is sold out of the Rural Development program as NP property, the closing of the sale may not take place until tenants have received all notifications and benefits afforded to tenants in prepaying projects in accordance with 7 CFR part 3560, subpart N.
