####### i.e.,

(ix) A section containing all applicable reference material (minimum sample requirements, row width factors, etc.).

(g) The sixth section must contain information related to prices and rates of premium, including, as applicable:

(1) A detailed description of the premium rating methodology proposed to be used and the basis for selection of the rating methodology;

(2) A list of all assumptions made in the premium rating and commodity pricing methodologies, and the basis for these assumptions;

(3) A detailed description of the pricing and rating methodologies, including:

(i) Supporting documentation needed for the rate methodology;

(ii) All mathematical formulas and equations;

(iii) Data and data sources used in determining rates and prices and a detailed assessment of the data (including availability, access, long term reliability, and the percentage of the total commercial production that the available data represents) and how it supports the proposed rates and prices;

(iv) A detailed explanation of how the rates account for each of the risks covered by the policy; and

(v) A detailed explanation of how the prices are applicable to the policy;

(4) An example of both a rate calculation and a price calculation;

(5) A discussion of the applicant's objective evaluation of the accuracy of the data, the short and long term availability of the data, and how the data will be obtained (if the data source is confidential or proprietary explain the cost of obtaining the data); and

(6) An analysis of the results of simulations or modeling showing the performance of proposed rates and commodity prices, as applicable, based on one or more of the following (Such simulations must use all years of experience available to the applicant and must reflect both partial losses and total losses):

(i) A recalculation of total premium and losses compared to a similar or comparable insurance plan offered under the authority of the Act with modifications, as needed, to represent the components of the 508(h) submission;

(ii) A simulation that shows liability, premium, indemnity, and loss ratios for the proposed insurance product based on the probability distributions used to develop the rates and commodity prices, as applicable, including sensitivity tests that demonstrate price or yield extremes, and the impact of inappropriate assumptions; or

(iii) Any other comparable simulation that provides results indicating both aggregate and individual performance of the 508(h) submission including expected liability, premium, indemnity, and loss ratios for the proposed insurance product, under various scenarios depicting good and poor actuarial experience.

(h) The seventh section must contain the following:

(1) A statement certifying that the submitter and any approved insurance provider or its affiliates will not solicit or market the 508(h) submission until after all policy materials are released to the public by RMA, unless otherwise specified by the Board;

(2) An explanation of any provision of the policy not authorized under the Act and identification of the portion of the rate of premium due to these provisions; and

(3) Agent and loss adjuster training plans, except for 508(h) submissions proposing only changes to rates of premium to an existing policy.

(i) The eighth section must contain a statement from the submitter that, if the 508(h) submission is approved, the submitter will work with RMA and its computer programmers as needed to assure an effective and efficient implementation process. This section must also contain a description of any expected implementation or administration issues. The applicant must consult with RMA prior to providing the 508(h) submission to determine whether or not the 508(h) submission can be effectively and efficiently implemented and administered through the current information technology systems and that all reporting requirements, terminology, and dates conform to USDA standards and initiatives.

(1) If FCIC approves the 508(h) submission and determines that its information technology systems have the capacity to implement and administer the 508(h) submission, the applicant must provide a document detailing acceptable computer processing requirements consistent with those used by RMA as shown on the RMA Web site in the Appendix III/M-13 Handbook. This information details the acceptable computer processing requirements in a manner consistent with that used by RMA to facilitate the acceptance of producer applications and related data.

(2) Any computer systems, requirements, code and software must be consistent with that used by RMA and comply with the standards established in Appendix III/M-13 Handbook, or any successor document, of the SRA or other reinsurance agreement as specified by FCIC.
