####### Uninsured lender.

(a)The lender or insuring agency cannot arbitrarily change the Lender's Agreement and related documents on the guaranteed loan, and the Agency will make the successor to the failed institution aware of the statutory and regulatory requirements. If the acquiring institution is not an eligible lender as set forth in ยง 4279.29 of this chapter, the Loan Note Guarantee will not be enforceable, and the institution must promptly apply to become an eligible lender. The failure of the uninsured lender to become an eligible lender will result in the Loan Note Guarantee being unenforceable. A new lender approved by the Agency will be afforded the benefits of the Loan Note Guarantee in the sharing of any loss and eligible expenses subject to the limits that are set forth in the regulations governing the program.
