###### Subpart A - Policy Statement and Provisions Governing the Extension of Tobacco Inspection and Price Support Services to New Markets and to Additional Sales on Designated Markets
####### § 29.2 Policy statement.
######## Reasonable inspection and price support services.

(a)The extension of tobacco inspection and price support services to new markets to warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), and additional sales will be conditioned upon the reasonableness of such services existing in the marketing area of the proposed new market or additional sale.

Determination with respect to reasonableness, and consequently with respect to granting or denying additional services, will be based on evidence (1) that the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale will function as a bona fide auction sale, and (2) that additional services are justifiable in relation to other market data, including the volume of tobacco produced in the area surrounding the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the roads and road distances involved in moving tobacco to the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale in relation to other tobacco marketing centers; the relative availability or congestion of all facilities for redrying and packing tobacco handled or to be handled in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the location of other auction markets on which tobacco produced in the marketing area of the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale may be marketed; the number of tobacco growers to be affected by the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the volume of tobacco likely to be sold in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the relationship of sales in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale to sales in other auction markets in the producing area for that kind of tobacco; other economic factors affecting the marketing of tobacco, by growers, in the marketing area of the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale and in the producing area for that kind of tobacco, including limitations on sales imposed by any marketing agreement and/or order, or by any other means; and also, as to flue-cured tobacco, data with regard to producer designations which shall include, but not be limited to, the markets and warehouses currently available for the producers, who would be eligible to designate the new market or, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in § 29.1(e), who already designate and who desire to designate the new market.
