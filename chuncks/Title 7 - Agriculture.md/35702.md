(ii)The step-by-step measurement procedure shall be as shown in Figure 7. Prior to leaving the CO for testing, dial the 900 ohm plus two microfarad quiet termination from a spare pair and measure the termination to determine that it actually is quiet. Circuit noise (noise-metallic) shall be measured at the customer access location across the tip and ring terminals of the pair under test. Power influence (direct reading with loop checking equipment) shall be measured at the customer access location from tip and ring conductors-to-ground (this connection is completed via the test unit). The power influence measurement includes the entire talking connection from the quiet termination to the customer. (That is, the power influence measurement includes all the CO equipment which normally makes up the connection.) Figure 7 is as follows:
