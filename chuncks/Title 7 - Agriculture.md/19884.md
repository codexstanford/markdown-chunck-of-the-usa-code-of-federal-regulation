######## Benchmark revenue

means allowable gross revenue for the benchmark year. If a producer began farming in 2020 or 2021 and did not have allowable gross revenue in either 2018 or 2019, the benchmark revenue is the producer's reasonably expected allowable gross revenue for the disaster year prior to the impact of the qualifying disaster event.
