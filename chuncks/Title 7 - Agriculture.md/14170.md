####### ยง 275.21 Quality control review reports.
######## Individual cases.

(b)The State agency shall report the review findings on each case selected for review during the sample month. For active cases, the State agency shall thoroughly document the Quality Control Review Schedule, Form FNS-380, to ensure any subsequent case reviewers fully understand household circumstances pertaining to the QC review as well as the reasons for the individual case finding and disposition. The State agency shall also code the findings on the Form FNS-380-1. For negative cases, the State agency shall submit a summary report, coded and documented on the Negative Quality Control Review Schedule, Form FNS-245, in enough detail to ensure subsequent case reviewers fully understand the reasons for the individual finding and disposition. The review findings shall be reported as follows:

(1) The State agency shall utilize SNAPQCS, FNS' automated, web-based QC System, to report all required QC forms, supporting evidence, and information necessary to understand the disposition and final findings for active and negative sampled cases to FNS. Upon State agency request, FNS will consider approval of any technical changes in the review results after they have been reported to FNS.

(2) The State agency shall have at least 115 days from the end of the sample month to dispose of and report the findings of all cases selected in a sample month. FNS may grant additional time as warranted upon request by a State agency for cause shown to complete and dispose of individual cases.

(3) The State agency shall supply the FNS Regional Office with individual household case records and the pertinent information contained in the individual case records, or legible copies of that material, as well as legible hard copies of individual Forms FNS-380, FNS-380-1, and FNS-245 or other FNS-approved report forms, within 10 days of receipt of a request for such information.

(4) For each case that remains pending 115 days after the end of the sample month, the State agency shall immediately submit a report that includes an explanation of why the case has not been disposed of, documentation describing the progress of the review to date, and the date by which it will be completed. If FNS extends the time frames in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this date will be extended accordingly. If FNS determines that the report in the first sentence of this paragraph (b)(4) does not sufficiently justify the case's pending status, the case shall be considered overdue. Depending upon the number of overdue cases, FNS may find the State agency's QC system to be inefficient or ineffective and suspend and/or disallow the State agency's Federal share of administrative funds in accordance with the provisions of ยง 276.4.
