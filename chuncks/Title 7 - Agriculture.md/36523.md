###### Electrical requirements,Dielectric strength.

(4)-(i)A housing fully equipped with cross-connect modules shall be tested for dielectric strength in accordance with (g)(4) of this section.

(ii) The dielectric strength of a contact within the cross-connect module to contacts on either side shall be tested. The module shall be tested in a dry environment with an ac power source capable of supplying 8 kv at a rate of increase of 500 volts per second, a circuit breaker to open at breakdown, and a voltmeter to record the breakdown potential. Cross-connect modules shall be prepared in accordance with industry accepted splicing techniques with leads trimmed to approximately 38 cm (15 in.). The dielectric strength of each contact to the contacts on either side shall have an average dielectric strength of approximately 5.0 kv.
