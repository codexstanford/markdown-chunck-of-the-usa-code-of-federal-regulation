####### Temporary designation of regulated areas.

(c)The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonregulated area as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonregulated area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonregulated area. Thereafter, the movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a regulated area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the regulated areas list, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
