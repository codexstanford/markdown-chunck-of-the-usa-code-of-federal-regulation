####### Selection of hearing officer or hearing panel.

(2)In order to properly evaluate grievances and appeals, the borrower and tenant must select a hearing officer or hearing panel. If the borrower and the tenant cannot agree on a hearing officer, then they must each appoint a member to a hearing panel and the members selected must appoint a third member. If within 30 days from the date of the request for a hearing, the tenant and borrower have not agreed upon the selection of a hearing officer or hearing panel, the borrower must notify the Agency by mail of the situation. The Agency will appoint a person to serve as the sole hearing officer. The Agency may not appoint a hearing officer who was earlier considered by either the borrower or the tenant, in the interest of ensuring the integrity of the process.
