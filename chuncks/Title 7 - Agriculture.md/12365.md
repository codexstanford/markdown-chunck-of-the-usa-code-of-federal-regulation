The audit must determine that the processor's performance is in compliance with the requirements in this part, and must be conducted in accordance with procedures in the FNS Audit Guide for Processors. All processors must pay for audits required in this paragraph (b). An in-State or multi-State processor must obtain an audit:

(1) Annually, if it receives, on average, more than $5,000,000 in donated foods for processing per year;

(2) Every two years, if it receives, on average, between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 in donated foods for processing per year; or
