######## Verification of users and other funds.

(b)(1) In connection with a loan for a utility type project to be secured by a pledge of user fees or revenues, the District Director will authenticate the number of users prior to loan closing or the commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Such individual will review each signed user agreement and check evidence of cash contributions. If during the review any indication is received that all signed users may not connect to the system, there will be such additional investigation made as deemed necessary to determine the number of users who will connect to the system. The District Director will record the determination in a memorandum to the State Director.

(2) In all cases the availability and amounts of other funds to be used in the project will be verified by Rural Development.
