######## Specification of services.

(3)All management contracts will provide for termination by either the contractor or the Government upon 30 days written notice. Contracts providing for management of multiple properties will also provide for properties to be added or removed from the contractor's assignment whenever necessary, such as when a property is acquired or taken into custody during the period of a contract or when a property is sold from inventory. If a contractor prepares repair specifications, that contractor will be excluded from the solicitation for making the repairs to avoid a conflict of interest.

If a management contract calls for specification writing services, a clause must be inserted in the contract prohibiting the preparer or his/her associates from doing the repair work.
