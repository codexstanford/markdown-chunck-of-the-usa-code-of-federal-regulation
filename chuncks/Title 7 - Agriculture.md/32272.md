######## e.g.,

(19) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a MAP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the MAP Participant's domestic home office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.

(c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart, but for generic promotion activities only, CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

(1) Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost of living adjustments paid to a U.S. citizen employee or a U.S. citizen contractor stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, except CCC will not reimburse that portion of:

(i) The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15 Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees; or

(ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel.

(2) Approved Supergrade salaries for non-U.S. citizen employees and non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas;

(3) Compensation of non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas, subject to the following limitations:

(i) Where there is a local U.S. Embassy Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan, except for approved Supergrades; or

(ii) Where an FSN salary plan does not exist, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds locally prevailing levels, which the MAP Participant shall document by a salary survey or other means, except for approved Supergrades;

(4) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;

(5) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;

(6) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved MAP-funded overseas offices;

(7) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;

(8)(i) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:

(A) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and

(B) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country.

(ii) CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.
