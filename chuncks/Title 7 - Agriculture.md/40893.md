####### ยง 1962.27 Termination or satisfaction of chattel security instruments.
######## Filing or recording satisfactions.

(d)Satisfactions of chattel mortgages and similar instruments will be made on Form RD 460-4, "Satisfaction," or other form approved by the State Director. The original of the satisfaction form will be delivered to the borrower for recording or filing and the copy will be retained in the borrower's case file. However, if the State supplement based on State law requires recording or filing by the mortgagee, a second copy will be prepared for the borrower and the original will be recorded or filed by the County Supervisor. When State statutes provide that satisfactions may be accomplished by marginal entry on the records of the recording office, or when Form RD 460-4 is not legally sufficient because special circumstances require some other form of satisfaction, County Supervisors are authorized to make such satisfactions according to State supplements. In such cases, Form RD 460-4 will not be prepared but a notation of the satisfaction will be made on the copy of Form RD 451-1, "Acknowledgment of Cash Payment," or Form RD 456-3, "Journal Voucher for Write-Off or Judgment," which will be retained in the borrower's case folder.
