(2)The application of these principles is based on the fundamental premises that:

(a) State agencies are responsible for the efficient and effective administration of SNAP through the application of sound management practice.

(b) The State agency assumes the responsibility for seeing that SNAP funds have been expended and accounted for consistent with underlying agreements and program objectives.

(c) Each State agency, in recognition of its own unique combination of staff facilities and experience, will have the primary responsibility for employing whatever form of organization and management techniques as may be necessary to assure proper and efficient administration.
