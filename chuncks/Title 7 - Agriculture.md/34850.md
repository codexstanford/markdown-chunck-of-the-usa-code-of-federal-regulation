###### ยง 1737.32 Loan Design (LD).

(a) A loan application requires supporting data collectively called a "Loan Design." The LD contains a forecast of service requirements and a narrative with supporting exhibits. Most of the items included in the LD are similar for all loan applications. However, as noted below, there are certain additional requirements for initial loans and for any exchange areas not previously financed by RUS, and other additional requirements for subsequent loans for areas previously financed by RUS. The LD must conform to the borrower's state telecommunications modernization plan unless the borrower is seeking a guaranteed loan (for additional information concerning the plan, see 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B).
