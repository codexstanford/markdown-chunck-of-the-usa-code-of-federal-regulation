######## Locked in repayment rate

means an announced repayment rate on a disbursed MAL that the producer has locked in for 60 calendar days. All locked in repayment rates expire within 14 calendar days before the loan maturity date. MAL can be repaid either at principal plus interest or the repayment rate in effect on the date the repayment is made. The repayment rate can only be locked in one time for a designated quantity and, if multiple locked in repayment rates are in effect for quantities under MAL that have not had a locked in repayment rate, the oldest rate is always applied first.
