######## Contracts for legal services.

(c)On projects requiring more legal services than are customarily required for title clearance alone, the applicant will be required to have a written contract when loan funds will be used for legal services. All such contracts will be subject to review and approval by the State director and therefore should be submitted to the State Director before execution by the applicant. Contracts will provide for the types of service to be performed and the amount of fees to be paid either in lump sum on the completion of all services or in installments as services are performed.
