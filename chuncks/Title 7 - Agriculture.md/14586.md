(2) Disqualify the firm for 5 years if it is to be the firm's first sanction, the firm had been previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of possible consequences of violating the regulations, and the evidence shows that:

(iv) A wholesale food concern's stated redemptions of coupons for a particular retail food store, nonprofit cooperative food-purchasing venture, group living arrangement, drug addict and alcoholic treatment program, homeless meal providers, or shelters for battered women and children exceeded the actual amount of coupons which that firm or organization redeemed through the wholesaler; or

(v) Personnel of the firm knowingly accepted coupons from an unauthorized firm or an individual known not to be legally entitled to possess coupons.

(3) Disqualify the firm for 3 years if it is to be the first sanction for the firm and the evidence shows that:

(iv) A wholesale food concern accepted coupons from an authorized firm which it was not authorized to serve and the wholesale food concern had been previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of possible consequences of violating the regulations; or

(v) The firm is an authorized retail food store and personnel of the firm have engaged in food coupon transactions with other authorized retail stores, not including treatment programs, group living arrangements, homeless meal providers, or shelters for battered women and children, and the firm had been previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of the possible consequences of violating the regulations.
