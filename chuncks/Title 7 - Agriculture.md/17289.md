####### NCS base period

means the 10 consecutive crop years (as defined in the crop policy) ending 2 crop years prior to the crop year in which the NCS classification becomes effective for all crops, except those specified on the Special Provisions. For these excepted crops, the NCS base period means the 10 consecutive crop years ending 3 crop years prior to the crop year in which the NCS classification becomes effective. For example: An NCS classification effective for the 1996 crop year against a producer of citrus production in Arizona, California, and Texas, or sugarcane would have a NCS base period that includes the 1984 through 1993 crop years. An NCS classification effective for the 1996 crop year against a producer of all other crops would have a NCS base period that includes the 1985 through 1994 crop years.
