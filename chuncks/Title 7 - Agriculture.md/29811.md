is calculated as follows for:

(1) ARC-CO, for a crop year of a covered commodity: The actual average county yield per planted acre of the covered commodity times the higher of either the market year average (MYA) price of the covered commodity or the national average loan rate for the covered commodity. If a county has separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields established for a covered commodity, the actual crop revenue calculated for a farm with that covered commodity will be weighted by FSA based on the farm's historical irrigated percentage.

(i) The total production of the covered commodity for all enrolled farms in the State in which the producer has an interest; times

(ii) The higher of either the MYA price or national loan rate for the covered commodity; divided by
