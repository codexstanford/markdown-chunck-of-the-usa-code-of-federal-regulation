######## Disclosure of children's free or reduced price meal eligibility information to Medicaid and/or CHIP, unless parents decline.

(h)Children's free or reduced price meal eligibility information only may be disclosed to Medicaid or CHIP when both the State agency and the sponsor so elect, the parental/guardian does not decline to have their eligibility information disclosed and the other provisions described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section are met. The State agency or sponsor, as appropriate, may disclose children's names, eligibility status (whether they are eligible for free or reduced price meals), and any other eligibility information obtained through the free and reduced price meal applications or obtained through direct certification to persons directly connected with the administration of Medicaid or CHIP. Persons directly connected to the administration of Medicaid and CHIP are State employees and persons authorized under Federal and State Medicaid and CHIP requirements to carry out initial processing of Medicaid or CHIP applications or to make eligibility determinations for Medicaid or CHIP.

(1) The State agency must ensure that:

(i) The sponsors and health insurance program officials have a written agreement that requires the health insurance program agency to use the eligibility information to seek to enroll children in Medicaid and CHIP; and

(ii) Parents/guardians are notified that their eligibility information may be disclosed to Medicaid or CHIP and given an opportunity to decline to have their children's eligibility information disclosed, prior to any disclosure.
