##### PART 29 - TOBACCO INSPECTION
###### Subpart A - Policy Statement and Provisions Governing the Extension of Tobacco Inspection and Price Support Services to New Markets and to Additional Sales on Designated Markets
####### ยง 29.2 Policy statement.

Inspection and price support services currently provided in auction marketing areas are adequate and the lack of these services is not a limiting factor to accelerated marketings or the extension of price support to producers. Consequently, the extension of inspection and price support services, without limitation even though the cost of such service is paid by the seller, would not contribute to the effectuation of the purposes of either of these services. The additional cost incident to the unlimited extension of these services would be unjustifiable and excessive in relation to the total quantity of tobacco available for market. Accordingly, inspection and price support services shall be made available on new markets at warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in ยง 29.1(e), and additional sales for other than flue-cured tobacco only as hereinafter provided. With regard to flue-cured tobacco, allocation of inspection services is based on producer designation, as provided for in 7 CFR 1464.2(e)(2)(iii), see subpart G. Also, since these services shall be made available to new markets to warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for "designated markets" set forth in ยง 29.1(e), and additional sales only as herein provided, referenda incident to market designations shall not be conducted until auction markets seeking designation have qualified for inspection and price support services as herein provided.
