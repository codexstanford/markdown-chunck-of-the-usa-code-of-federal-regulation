######## Purchasing consigned produce.

(c)A commission merchant or joint account partner may not purchase produce received on consignment or joint account or sell such produce to any person or firm over whose business he has direct or indirect control, or to any person or firm having direct or indirect control over his business, without specific prior authority of the consignor or the joint account partner. However, produce may be purchased by the commission merchant or joint account partner at reasonable market value to clean up remnants of shipments so accountings will not be unduly delayed, provided the accounting shows the quantity and price of the goods bought by the commission merchant or joint account partner. "Remnants," as used here, mean small quantities remaining after the bulk of the shipment has been sold but shall not exceed 5 percent of the shipment. When consigned produce is purchased by a commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.
