###### Nonhistorical licenses (Appendix 2).

(c)The Licensing Authority will allocate nonhistorical licenses on the basis of a rank-order lottery system, which will operate as follows:

(1) The minimum license size shall be:

(i) Where the article is cheese or cheese product:

(A) The total amount available for nonhistorical license where such amount is less than 9,500 kilograms;

(B) 9,500 kilograms where the total amount available for nonhistorical license is between 9,500 kilograms and 500,000 kilograms, inclusive;

(C) 19,000 kilograms where the total amount available for nonhistorical license is between 500,001 kilograms and 1,000,000 kilograms, inclusive;

(D) 38,000 kilograms where the total amount available for nonhistorical license is greater than 1,000,000 kilograms; or

(E) An amount less than the minimum license size established in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of this section, if requested by the licensee;

(ii) Where the article is not cheese or cheese product:

(A) The total amount available for nonhistorical license where such amount is less than 19,000 kilograms;

(B) 19,000 kilograms where the total amount available for nonhistorical license is between 19,000 kilograms and 550,000 kilograms, inclusive;

(C) 38,000 kilograms where the total amount available for nonhistorical license is between 550,001 kilograms and 1,000,000 kilograms, inclusive; and

(D) 57,000 kilograms where the total amount available for nonhistorical license is greater than 1,000,000 kilograms;

(E) An amount less than the minimum license sizes established in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section, if requested by the licensee.

(2) Taking into account the order of preference expressed by each applicant, as required by ยง 6.24(c), the Licensing Authority will allocate licenses for an article from a country by a series of random draws. A license of minimum size will be issued to each applicant in the order established by such draws until the total amount of such article in Appendix 2 has been allocated. An applicant that receives a license for an article will be removed from the pool for subsequent draws until every applicant has been allocated at least one license, provided that the licenses for which they applied are not already fully allocated. Any amount remaining after the random draws which is less than the applicable minimum license size may, at the discretion of the licensing Authority, be prorated equally among the licenses awarded for that article.
