####### ยง 250.11 Delivery and receipt of donated food shipments.
######## Replacement of donated foods.

(c)The vendor is responsible for the replacement of donated foods that are delivered out-of-condition. Such responsibility extends until expiration of the vendor warranty period included in the vendor contract with USDA. In all cases, responsibility for replacement is contingent on the determination that the foods were out-of-condition at the time of delivery. Replacement must be in-kind, unless FNS approves similar replacement (the terms in-kind and similar replacement are defined in ยง 250.2). If FNS determines that physical replacement of donated foods is not cost-effective or efficient, FNS may:

(1) Approve payment by the vendor to the distributing or recipient agency, as appropriate, for the value of the donated foods at time of delivery (or at another value determined by FNS); or

(2) Credit the distributing agency's entitlement, as feasible.
