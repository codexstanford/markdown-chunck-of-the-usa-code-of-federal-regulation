(ii)means a principal campaign committee, or other authorized committee, organized to further the candidate's campaign in a future Federal election.

(iii) For purposes of the contribution limits, a contribution made after an election has been held, or after an individual ceases to be a candidate in an election, shall be aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor for the next election unless the contribution is designated for the previous election, or is designated for another election, and the candidate has net debts outstanding for the election so designated pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3).

(iv) For purposes of this section, an individual ceases to be a candidate in an election as of the earlier of the following dates-

(A) The date on which the candidate publicly announces that he or she will no longer be a candidate in that election for that office and ceases to conduct campaign activities with respect to that election; or

(B) The date on which the candidate is or becomes ineligible for nomination or election to that office by operation of law;

(5) Transfers of funds between the principal campaign committees of an individual seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office, as long as the conditions in 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5) (i), (ii) and (iii) are met. An individual will be considered to be seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office if the individual is concurrently a candidate for more than one Federal office during the same or overlapping election cycles.

(i) The transfer shall not be made when the individual is actively seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office. An individual will not be considered to be actively seeking nomination or election to a Federal office if:

(A) The individual publicly announces that he or she will no longer seek nomination or election to that office and ceases to conduct campaign activities with respect to that election, except in connection with the retirement of debts outstanding at the time of the announcement;

(B) The individual is or becomes ineligible for nomination or election to that office by operation of law;

(ii) The limitations on contributions by persons shall not be exceeded by the transfer. The cash on hand from which the transfer is made shall be considered to consist of the funds most recently received by the transferor committee. The transferor committee must be able to demonstrate that such cash on hand contains sufficient funds at the time of the transfer that comply with the limitations and prohibitions of the Act to cover the amount transferred. A contribution shall be excluded from the amount transferred to the extent that such contribution, when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor to the transferee principal campaign committee, exceeds the contribution limits set forth at 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2, as appropriate; and

(iii) The candidate has not elected to receive funds under 26 U.S.C. 9006 or 9037 for either election; or

(6) [Reserved]

(7) The authorized committees of a candidate for more than one Federal office, or for a Federal office and a nonfederal office, shall follow the requirements for separate campaign organizations set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(d).
