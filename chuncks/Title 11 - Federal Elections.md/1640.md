###### Certification of additional payments by Commission.

(d)(1) When a candidate who is eligible under 11 CFR 9033.4 submits an additional submission for payment in the Presidential election year, and before the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review the additional submission and will certify to the Secretary at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an amount to which the candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b). See 11 CFR 9036.4 for Commission procedures for certification of additional payments.

(2) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review each additional submission and resubmission, and will certify to the Secretary, at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an amount to which the ineligible candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b), unless the projected dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions contained in the submission or resubmission exceeds 15% of the amount requested. In the latter case, the Commission will return the additional submission or resubmission to the candidate and request that it be corrected, unless the resubmission was made on the last date for resubmissions in September of the year following the Presidential election year. Corrected submissions and resubmissions will be reviewed by the Commission in accordance with 11 CFR 9036.4 and 9036.5. Submissions and resubmissions will not be considered to be corrected unless the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions has been reduced to no more than 15% of the amount requested.
