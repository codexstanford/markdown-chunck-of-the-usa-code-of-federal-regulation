#### PART 9036 - REVIEW OF MATCHING FUND SUBMISSIONS AND CERTIFICATION OF PAYMENTS BY COMMISSION
##### ยง 9036.4 Commission review of submissions.
###### Acceptance of submission for review of matchability.

(b)If the Commission determines that a submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 satisfies the requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2 (b), (c) and (d), and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order, it will review the matchability of the contributions contained therein. The Commission, in conducting its review, may utilize statistical sampling techniques. Based on the results of its review, the Commission may calculate a matchable amount for the submission which is less than the amount requested by the candidate. If the Commission certifies for payment to the Secretary an amount that is less than the amount requested by the candidate in a particular submission, or reduces the amount of a subsequent certification to the Secretary by adjusting a previous certification made under 11 CFR 9036.2(c)(1), the Commission will notify the candidate in writing of the following:

(1) The amount of the difference between the amount requested and the amount to be certified by the Commission;

(2) The amount of each contribution and the corresponding contributor's name for each contribution that the Commission has rejected as nonmatchable and the reason that it is not matchable; or if statistical sampling is used, the estimated amount of contributions by type and the reason for rejection;

(3) The amount of contributions that have been determined to be matchable and that the Commission will certify to the Secretary for payment; and

(4) A statement that the candidate may supply the Commission with additional documentation or other information in the resubmission of any rejected contribution under 11 CFR 9036.5 in order to show that a rejected contribution is matchable under 11 CFR 9034.2.
