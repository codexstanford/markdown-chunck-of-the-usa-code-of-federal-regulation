###### Application of limitations to elections.

(i)(1) The limitations on contributions of this section (other than paragraph (e) of this section) shall apply separately with respect to each election as defined in 11 CFR 100.2, except that all elections held in a calendar year for the office of President of the United States (except a general election for that office) shall be considered to be one election.

(2) An election in which a candidate is unopposed is a separate election for the purposes of the limitations on contributions of this section.

(3) A primary or general election which is not held because a candidate is unopposed or received a majority of votes in a previous election is a separate election for the purposes of the limitations on contributions of this section. The date on which the election would have been held shall be considered to be the date of the election.

(4) A primary election which is not held because a candidate was nominated by a caucus or convention with authority to nominate is not a separate election for the purposes of the limitations on contributions of this section.
