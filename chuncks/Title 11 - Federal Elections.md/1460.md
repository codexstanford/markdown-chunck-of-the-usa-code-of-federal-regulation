In addition to the requirements set forth at 11 CFR 102.9(b), the convention committee must include as part of the evidence of convention expenses the following documentation:

(a) For disbursements in excess of $200 to a payee, either:

(1) A receipted bill from the payee that states the purpose of the disbursement; or

(2) If such a receipted bill is not available, the following documents;

(i) A canceled check negotiated by the payee; plus

(ii) One of the following documents generated by the payee-a bill, invoice, voucher or contemporaneous memorandum that states the purpose of the disbursement;

(iii) Where the documents specified at paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section are not available, a voucher or contemporaneous memorandum from the committee that states the purpose of the disbursement;

(3) If neither a receipted bill nor the supporting documentation specified in paragraph (a)(2) (ii) or (iii) of this section is available, a canceled check negotiated by the payee that states the purpose of the disbursement.

(4) Where the supporting documentation required above is not available, the committee may present a canceled check and collateral evidence to document the convention expense. Such collateral evidence may include but is not limited to:

(i) Evidence demonstrating that the disbursement is part of an identifiable program or project which is otherwise sufficiently documented, such as a disbursement which is one of a number of documented disbursements relating to the operation of a committee office;

(ii) Evidence that the disbursement is covered by a preestablished written committee policy, such as a daily travel expense policy.

(b) For all other disbursements:

(1) If from the petty cash fund, a record that states the full name and mailing address of the payee and the amount, date and purpose of the disbursement; or

(2) A canceled check which has been negotiated by the payee and states the identification of the payee, and the amount and date of the disbursement.
