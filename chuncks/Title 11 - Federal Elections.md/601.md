###### Determining whether a person is reasonably known to be a lobbyist/registrant or lobbyist/registrant PAC.

(2)(i) In order to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a reporting committee must consult, in a manner reasonably calculated to find the name of each person who is a lobbyist/registrant or lobbyist/registrant PAC, the Web sites maintained by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the Senate, and the Federal Election Commission to determine whether, at the time a contribution was forwarded to, or received by, the reporting committee:

(A) The person was listed as a current registrant under Section 4(a) of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1603(a));

(B) The person was an individual listed on a current registration filed under Section 4(b)(6) or a current report filed under Section 5(b)(2)(C) of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1603 or 1604);

(C) The person identified itself as a lobbyist/registrant PAC on its Statement of Organization, FEC Form 1, filed with the Commission; or

(D) The person was listed as a political committee established or controlled by a lobbyist or registrant on a report filed under Sec. 203(a) of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, amending the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1604).

(ii) A manner reasonably calculated to find the name of each person who is a lobbyist/registrant or lobbyist/registrant PAC may be demonstrated by the reporting committee producing a computer printout or screen capture from a Web browser indicating that the name of the person sought was not listed in the results of the Web site consultations performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Such a computer printout or screen capture shall constitute conclusive evidence that the reporting committee has consulted such Web sites and not found the name of the person sought, but shall not be the exclusive means by which the reporting committee may provide evidence that it has consulted such Web sites and not found the name of the person sought.

(iii) A reporting committee shall be subject to the reporting requirement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it had actual knowledge that, at the time a contribution was forwarded or received, the person whose name is sought was required to be listed on any registration or report described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
