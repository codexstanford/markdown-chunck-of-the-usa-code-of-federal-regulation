(2)Regardless of the allocation ratio calculated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate to its Federal account at least 65% each of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives each year. If the committee's own allocation calculation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section yields a Federal share greater than 65%, then the higher percentage shall be applied.
