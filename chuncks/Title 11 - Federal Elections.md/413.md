###### Checks combining contributions with other payments.

(3)A contributor may write a check that represents both a contribution and payment of dues or other fees. The check must be drawn on the contributor's personal checking account or on a non-repayable corporate drawing account of the individual contributor. Under a payroll deduction plan, an employer may write a check on behalf of its employees to a union or its agent, which check represents a combined payment of voluntary contributions to the union's separate segregated fund and union dues or other employee deductions.
