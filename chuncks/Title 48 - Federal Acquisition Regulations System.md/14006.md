###### 1837.170 Pension portability.

(a) It is NASA's policy not to require pension portability in service contracts. However, pension portability requirements may be included in solicitations, contracts, or contract modifications for additional work under the following conditions:

(1)(i) There is a continuing need for the same or similar services for a minimum of five years (inclusive of options), and, if the contractor changes, a high percentage of the predecessor contractor's employees are expected to remain with the program; or

(ii) The employees under a predecessor contract were covered by a portable pension plan, a follow-on contract or a contract consolidating existing services is awarded, and the total contract period covered by the plan covers a minimum of five years (including both the predecessor and successor contracts); and

(2) The procurement officer determines in writing, with full supporting rationale, that such a requirement is in the Government's best interest. The procurement officer shall maintain a record of all such determinations.

(b) When pension portability is required, the plan shall comply with the requirements of the clause at 1852.237-71, Pension Portability, (see 1837.110-70(b)), and the contract shall also include a clear description of the plan, including service, pay, liabilities, vesting, termination, and benefits from prior contracts.
