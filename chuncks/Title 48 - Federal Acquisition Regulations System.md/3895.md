####### e.g.,

(x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (evidence of shipment).

(2) An interim payment request under a cost-reimbursement contract for services constitutes a proper invoice for purposes of this subsection if it includes all of the information required by the contract.

(3) If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office must return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days on contracts for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days on contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. If such notice is not timely, then the designated billing office must adjust the due date for the purpose of determining an interest penalty, if any.
