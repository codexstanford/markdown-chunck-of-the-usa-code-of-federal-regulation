###### 45.102 Policy.

(a) Contractors are ordinarily required to furnish all property necessary to perform Government contracts.

(b) Contracting officers shall provide property to contractors only when it is clearly demonstrated-

(1) To be in the Government's best interest;

(2) That the overall benefit to the acquisition significantly outweighs the increased cost of administration, including ultimate property disposal;

(3) That providing the property does not substantially increase the Government's assumption of risk; and

(4) That Government requirements cannot otherwise be met.

(c) The contractor's inability or unwillingness to supply its own resources is not sufficient reason for the furnishing or acquisition of property.
