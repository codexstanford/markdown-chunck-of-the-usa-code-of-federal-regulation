####### Difference from other than commercial financing.

(c)Government financing of commercial purchases under this subpart is expected to be different from that used for other than commercial purchases under subpart 32.1 and its related subparts. While the contracting officer may adapt techniques and procedures from the other than commercial subparts for use in implementing commercial contract financing arrangements, the contracting officer must have a full understanding of effects of the differing contract environments and of what is needed to protect the interests of the Government in commercial contract financing.
