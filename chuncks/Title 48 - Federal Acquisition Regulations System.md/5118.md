GSA, DOD, and VA will not forward bills to contractors for supplies ordered from Government stock until after the supplies have been shipped. Receipt of billing is sufficient evidence to establish contractor liability and to provide a basis for payment. Contracting officers should direct their contractors to make payment promptly upon receipt of billings.
