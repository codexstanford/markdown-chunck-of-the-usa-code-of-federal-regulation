####### Before SBA decision.

(h)(1) After receiving a protest involving the apparent successful offeror's status as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern, the contracting officer shall either-

(i) Withhold award of the contract until SBA determines the status of the protested concern; or

(ii) Award the contract after receipt of the protest but before SBA issues its decision if the contracting officer determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest.

(2) SBA will determine the merits of the status protest within 15 business days after receipt of a protest, or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer.

(3) If SBA does not issue its determination within 15 business days, or within any extension of time that is granted, the contracting officer may award the contract after determining in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its determination will be disadvantageous to the government. This determination shall be provided to the SBA's Director, Office of Government Contracting and a copy shall be included in the contract file.
