####### Exercise of march-in-rights.

(c)After notification to the contractor of information warranting the exercise of march-in rights, the CO shall prepare a written notice to the contractor after consultation with the Assistant Solicitor for Acquisitions and Intellectual Property. The notice shall be prepared and signed by the Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division. Within the time constraints, if the Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division determines any information submitted by the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) after notice of march-in is received raises a genuine dispute over material facts, a fact-finding hearing shall be conducted by OHA. The Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division shall issue a final determination, after consideration of any further written or oral arguments from the parties. An unfavorable determination to a contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) shall be subject to appeal.
