##### Review of claims.

(c)Any claim for entitlement to travel or relocation expenses must first be filed with the claimant's own department or agency (the agency). The agency shall initially adjudicate the claim. A claimant disagreeing with the agency's determination may request review of the claim by the Board. The burden is on the claimant to establish the timeliness of the claim, the liability of the agency, and the claimant's right to payment. The Board will issue the final decision on a claim based on the information submitted by the claimant and the agency.
