####### Exception.

(c)(1) The requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection does not apply if the head of the contracting activity determines that-

(i) An exception is necessary because DoD needs the domain experience and expertise of the highly qualified, apparently successful offeror; and

(ii) Based on the agreed-to resolution strategy, the apparently successful offeror will be able to provide objective and unbiased advice, as required by 209.571-3(a), without a limitation on future participation in development and production.

(2) The authority to make this determination cannot be delegated.
