(a) For DoD, the following two-part test determines whether a manufactured end product is a domestic end product:

(i) The end product is manufactured in the United States; and

(ii)(A) Except for an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of its U.S. and qualifying country components exceeds 55 percent of the cost of all its components. This test is applied to end products only and not to individual components.

(B) For an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country must constitute less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end product. The cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country includes but is not limited to the cost of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, utilized in the manufacture of the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, excluding commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) fasteners. The domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived for acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners.

(c) Additional exceptions that allow the purchase of foreign end products are listed at 225.103.
