####### Individual waiver.

(B)The contracting officer may also request a waiver of the requirements at paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section for an individual acquisition once the contracting officer determines through market research that no known small business manufacturers, processors, or producers in the United States or its outlying areas can reasonably be expected to offer an end item meeting the requirements of the solicitation. This type of waiver is known as an individual waiver and would apply only to a specific acquisition.
