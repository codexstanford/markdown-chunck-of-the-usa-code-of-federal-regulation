The requirement for performance and payment bonds is waived for cost-reimbursement contracts.

(1) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $40,000, but not exceeding $150,000, payment protection sufficient to pay labor and material costs, using any of the alternatives listed at FAR 28.102-1(b)(1).

(2) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $150,000-

(i) A payment bond sufficient to pay labor and material costs; and

(ii) A performance bond in an equal amount if available at no additional cost.
