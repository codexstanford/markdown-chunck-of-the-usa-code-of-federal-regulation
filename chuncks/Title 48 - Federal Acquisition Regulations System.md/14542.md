(1)OPM will consider such elements as the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and validity of complaints received by OPM, effectiveness of internal controls systems in place, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, enrollees, beneficiaries, and Congress as measures of economical and efficient contract performance. This factor will be judged apart from the Contractor'sresponsibility for contract compliance and will be a measure of the extent and nature of the Contractor's contribution to the FEGLI Program through the application of managerial expertise and effort. Evidence of effective contract performance will receive a plus weight, and poor performance or failure to comply with contract terms and conditions a zero weight. Innovations of benefit to the FEGLI Program will generally receive a plus weight; documented inattention or indifference to effective operations, a zero weight.
