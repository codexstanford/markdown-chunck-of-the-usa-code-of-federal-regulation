###### 51.102 Authorization to use Government supply sources.

(a) Before issuing an authorization to a contractor to use Government supply sources in accordance with 51.101 (a) or (b), the contracting officer shall place in the contract file a written finding supporting issuance of the authorization. A written finding is not required when authorizing use of the Government supply sources in accordance with 51.101(c). Except for findings under 51.101(a)(3), the determination shall be based on, but not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

(1) The administrative cost of placing orders with Government supply sources and the program impact of delay factors, if any.

(2) The lower cost of items available through Government supply sources.

(3) Suitability of items available through Government supply sources.

(4) Delivery factors such as cost and time.

(5) Recommendations of the contractor.

(b) Authorizations to subcontractors shall be issued through, and with the approval of, the contractor.

(c) Upon deciding to authorize a contractor to use Government supply sources, the contracting officer shall request, in writing, as applicable-

(1) A FEDSTRIP activity address code, through the agency's central contact point for matters involving activity address codes, from the General Services Administration (GSA), FXS, Washington, DC 20406;

(2) A MILSTRIP activity address code from the appropriate Department of Defense (DOD) service point listed in Section 1 of the Introduction to the DOD Activity Address Directory;

(3) Approval for the contractor to use Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) supply sources from the Executive Director, Office of Acquisition and Logistics (003A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington DC 20420;

(4) Approval for the contractor to acquire helium from the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Helium Field Operations, 801 S. Fillmore Street, Amarillo, TX 79101-3545 or

(5) Approval from the appropriate agency for the contractor to use a Government supply source other than those identified in (1) through (4) above.

(d) Each request made under paragraph (c) above shall contain-

(1) The complete address(es) to which the contractor's mail, freight, and billing documents are to be directed;

(2) A copy of the contracting officer's letter of authorization to the contractor;

(3) The prime contract number(s); and

(4) The effective date and duration of each contract.

(e) In each authorization to the contractor, the contracting officer-

(1) Shall cite the contract number(s) involved;

(2) Shall, when practicable, limit the period of the authorization;

(3) Shall specify, as appropriate, that-

(i) When requisitioning from GSA or DOD, the contractor shall use FEDSTRIP or MILSTRIP, as appropriate, and include the activity address code assigned by GSA or DOD;

(ii) When requisitioning from the VA, the contractor should use FEDSTRIP or MILSTRIP, as appropriate, Optional Form 347, Order for Supplies or Services (see 53.302-347), or an agency-approved form; and

(iii) When placing orders for helium with the Bureau of Land Management, the contractor shall reference the Federal contract number on the purchase order;

(4) May include any other limitations or conditions deemed necessary. For example, the contracting officer may-

(i) Authorize purchases from Government supply sources of any overhead supplies, but no production supplies;

(ii) Limit any authorization requirement to use Government sources to a specific dollar amount, thereby leaving the contractor free to make smaller purchases from other sources if so desired;

(iii) Restrict the authorization to certain facilities or to specific contracts; or

(iv) Provide specifically if vesting of title is to differ from other property acquired or otherwise furnished by the contractor for use under the contract; and

(5) Shall instruct the contractor to comply with the applicable policies and procedures prescribed in this subpart.

(f) After issuing the authorization, the authorizing agency shall be responsible for-

(1) Ensuring that contractors comply with the terms of their authorizations and that supplies and services obtained from Government supply sources are properly accounted for and properly used;

(2) Any indebtedness incurred for supplies or services and not satisfied by the contractor; and

(3) Submitting, in writing, to the appropriate Government sources, address changes of the contractor and deletions when contracts are completed or terminated.
