#### PART 212 - ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES
##### Subpart 212.1 - Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services
###### 212.102 Applicability.
####### Nontraditional defense contractors.

(iv)In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3457, contracting officers-

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(iv)(B) of this section, may treat supplies and services provided by nontraditional defense contractors as commercial products or commercial services. This permissive authority is intended to enhance defense innovation and investment, enable DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available, and create incentives for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD. It is not intended to recategorize current other than commercial products or commercial services; however, when appropriate, contracting officers may consider applying commercial product or commercial service procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from business segments that meet the definition of "nontraditional defense contractor" even though they have been established under traditional defense contractors. The decision to apply commercial product and commercial service procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial product or commercial service determination and does not mean the item is commercial;

(B) Shall treat services provided by a business unit that is a nontraditional defense contractor as commercial services, to the extent that such services use the same pool of employees as used for commercial customers and are priced using methodology similar to methodology used for commercial pricing; and

(C) Shall document the file when treating supplies or services from a nontraditional defense contractor as commercial products or commercial services in accordance with paragraph (a)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section.
