####### Service contracts.

(a)On contracts where the contract deliverable is the performance of a service over any given time period, contractor performance is definitively measurable within each evaluation period. In these cases, all evaluations are final, and the contractor keeps the fee earned in any period regardless of the evaluations of subsequent periods. Unearned award fee in any given period in a service contract is lost and shall not be carried forward, or "rolled-over," into subsequent periods.
