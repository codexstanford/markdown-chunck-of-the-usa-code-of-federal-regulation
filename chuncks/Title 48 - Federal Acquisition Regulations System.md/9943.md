###### 570.402-5 Potential acceptable locations.

If the contracting officer identifies potential acceptable locations through the advertisement or market survey, conduct a cost-benefit analysis following the procedures in 570.402-6. Based on the results of the cost-benefit analysis, take appropriate action as follows:

(a) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government will recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, develop an SFO and negotiate with all interested parties following 570.3.

(b) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government cannot expect to recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, prepare a justification for approval in accordance with FAR 6.3 and 506.3. Explain both:

(1) How the contracting officer performed the cost-benefit analysis.

(2) That the cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to any other offeror will likely result in substantial costs to the Government that the Government cannot expect to recover through competition.
