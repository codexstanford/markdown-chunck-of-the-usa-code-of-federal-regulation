(d)The Board assigns each case to a panel of three judges, one of whom presides. The presiding judge sets the case schedule, oversees discovery, and conducts conferences, hearings, and other proceedings. The presiding judge may without participation by other panel members decide any appeal under the small claims procedure of Rule 52, any nondispositive motion, or any petition, and may dismiss a case as permitted by Rule 12(c) (48 CFR 6101.12(c)). The Board decides all other matters by majority vote of a panel unless the full Board decides a matter under Rule 28 (48 CFR 6101.28). Only panel and full Board decisions are precedential.
