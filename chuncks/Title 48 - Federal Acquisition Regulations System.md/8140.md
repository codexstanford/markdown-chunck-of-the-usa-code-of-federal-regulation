###### 243.204-71 Certification of requests for equitable adjustment.

(a) A request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold may not be paid unless the contract certifies the request in accordance with the clause at 252.243-7002.

(b) To determine if the dollar threshold for requiring certification is met, add together the absolute value of each cost increase and each cost decrease. See PGI 243.204-71(b) for an example.

(c) The certification required by 10 U.S.C. 3862(a), as implemented in the clause at 252.243-7002, is different from the certification required by 41 U.S.C. 7103, Disputes. If the contractor has certified a request for equitable adjustment in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3862(a), and desires to convert the request to a claim under the Contract Disputes statute, the contractor shall certify the claim in accordance with FAR subpart 33.2.
