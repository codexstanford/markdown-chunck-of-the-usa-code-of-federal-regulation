## Chapter 16 - Office of Personnel Management Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation
### Subchapter C - Contracting Methods and Contract Types
#### PART 1615 - CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION
##### Subpart 1615.1 - Source Selection Processes and Techniques
###### 1615.170 Applicability.

FAR subpart 15.1 has no practical application to the FEHB Program because prospective contractors (carriers) are considered for inclusion in the FEHB Program according to criteria in 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 CFR part 890 rather than by competition between prospective carriers.
