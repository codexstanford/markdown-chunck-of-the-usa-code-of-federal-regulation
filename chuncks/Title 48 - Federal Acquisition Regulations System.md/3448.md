(i) Apply such exclusion only to the determination of final indirect cost rates (42.705); and

(ii) Adjust the exclusion to reflect the Government participation rate for flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts. For example, if there are aggregate increased costs to the Government of $100,000, and the indirect cost pool where the adjustment is to be effected has a Government participation rate of 50 percent for flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts, the contractor shall exclude $200,000 from the indirect cost pool ($100,000/50% = $200,000).
