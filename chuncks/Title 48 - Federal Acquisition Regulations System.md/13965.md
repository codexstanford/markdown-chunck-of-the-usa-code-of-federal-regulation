####### Interim billings based on costs incurred.

(a)(1) The contractor may include FCCOM in cost reimbursement and progress payment invoices. To determine the amount that qualifies as cost incurred, multiply the incurred portions of the overhead pool allocation bases by the latest available cost of money factors. These FCCOM calculations are interim estimates subject to adjustment.

(2) As actual cost of money factors are finalized, use the new factors to calculate FCCOM for the next accounting period.
