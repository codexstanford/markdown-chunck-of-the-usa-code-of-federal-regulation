###### 37.301 Labor standards.

Contracts for dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements are subject to either 41 U.S.C. chapter 67, Service Contract Labor Standards, or 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements (Construction). If the contract is solely for dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements, the Service Contract Labor Standards statute applies unless further work which will result in the construction, alteration, or repair of a public building or public work at that location is contemplated. If such further construction work is intended, even though by separate contract, then the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute applies to the contract for dismantling, demolition, or removal.
