####### Solicitation requirements.

(b)When using the price list method, in the solicitation:

(1) Include the price list.

(2) Include an estimate of requirements.

(3) Require the bidder to express its price as "net" or as a percentage added to or subtracted from the list prices for each group. Require the bidder to quote only one percentage factor for each group. This means that the bidder provides one percentage factor that applies to every item in a group; not a separate percentage for each item. "Net" indicates the bidder chooses to submit the list prices as its bid.

(4) Identify the percentage factor in paragraph (b)(3) of this section as a price related evaluation factor.
