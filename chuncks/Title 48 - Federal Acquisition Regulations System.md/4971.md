Under the termination clause, after partial termination, a contractor may request an equitable adjustment in the price or prices of the continued portion of a fixed-price contract. The TCO shall forward the proposal to the contracting officer except when negotiation authority is delegated to the TCO. The contractor shall submit the proposal in the format of Table 15-2 of 15.408.

(a) When the contracting officer retains responsibility for negotiating the equitable adjustment and executing a supplemental agreement, the contracting officer shall ensure that no portion of an increase in price is included in a termination settlement made or in process.

(b) The TCO shall also ensure that no portion of the costs included in the equitable adjustment are included in the termination settlement.
