Persons or firms found to be in violation of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute will have an active exclusion record contained in the System for Award Management (see 9.404). No Government contract may be awarded to any violator so listed because of a violation of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, or to any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which the violator has a substantial interest, without the approval of the Secretary of Labor. This prohibition against award to an ineligible contractor applies to both prime and subcontracts.
