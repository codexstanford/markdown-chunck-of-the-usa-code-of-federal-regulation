###### Actuarial Value of Assets:

(v)The valuation of the actuarial value of assets used for CAS 412 and 413 is based on a recognized smoothing technique that "provides equivalent recognition of appreciation and depreciation of the market value of the assets of the pension plan." The disclosed method also constrains the asset value to a corridor bounded by 80% to 120% of the market value of assets. This method for measuring the actuarial value of assets satisfies the provisions of 9904.413-50(b)(2).
