###### 715.602 Policy.

(a) USAID encourages the submission of unsolicited proposals which contribute new ideas consistent with and contributing to the accomplishment of the Agency's objectives. However, the requirements for contractor resources are normally quite program specific, and thus widely varied, and must be responsive to host country needs. Further, USAID's projects are usually designed in collaboration with the cooperating country. These factors can limit both the need for, and USAID's ability to use unsolicited proposals. Therefore, prospective offerors are encouraged to contact USAID to determine the Agency's technical and geographical requirements as related to the offeror's interests before preparing and submitting a formal unsolicited proposal.

(b) USAID's basic policies and procedures regarding unsolicited proposals are those established in FAR subpart 15.6 and this subpart.

(c) For detailed information on unsolicited proposals including point of contact information see (48 CFR) AIDAR 715.604.
