####### Work on a Government installation.

(b)(1) When the clause at 52.228-5, Insurance-Work on a Government Installation, is required to be included in a fixed-price contract by 28.310, the coverage specified in 28.307 is the minimum insurance required and shall be included in the contract Schedule or elsewhere in the contract. The contracting officer may require additional coverage and higher limits.

(2) When the clause at 52.228-5, Insurance-Work on a Government Installation, is not required by 28.310 but is included because the contracting officer considers it to be in the Government's interest to do so, any of the types of insurance specified in 28.307 may be omitted or the limits may be lowered, if appropriate.
