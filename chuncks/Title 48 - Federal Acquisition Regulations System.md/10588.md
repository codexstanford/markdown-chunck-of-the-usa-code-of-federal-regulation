(2) In considering consulting income as a factor when determining allowable salary for service under a contract:

(i) For faculty members working under annual appointments, salary for service under the contract may include the employee's on-campus salary plus "consulting income" (that is, income from employment other than the employee's regular on-campus appointment, excluding business or other activities not connected with the employee's profession) earned during the year preceding employment under the contract.

(ii) For faculty members working under academic year appointments, salary for service under the contract may include the employee's on-campus academic year salary plus "consulting income" as defined above earned during the year proceeding employment under the contract, or salary for service under the contract may be derived by annualizing the academic year salary (in which case "consulting income" may not be included).
