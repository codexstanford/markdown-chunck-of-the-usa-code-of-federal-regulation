###### 19.301-2 Rerepresentation by a contractor that represented itself as a small business concern.
####### Long-term contract

means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

(b) A contractor that represented itself as any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3) before contract award is required to rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status-

(1) For the NAICS code(s) in the contract-

(i) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include the clause at 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract;

(ii) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition (whether the contractor acquires or is acquired by another company) of the contractor that does not require novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include the clause at 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract;

(iii) For long-term contracts-

(A) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(B) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter; or

(2) For the NAICS code assigned to an order under a multiple-award contract, if the contracting officer requires contractors to rerepresent their size and socioeconomic status for that order.

(c) A contractor is required to rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of its rerepresentation that corresponds to the NAICS code that was initially assigned to the contract. For multiple-award contracts where there is more than one NAICS code assigned, the contractor is required to rerepresent its size status for each NAICS code assigned to the contract.
