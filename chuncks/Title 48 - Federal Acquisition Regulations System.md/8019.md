(a) Common carriers are not required to submit certified cost or pricing data before award of contracts for tariffed services. Rates or preliminary estimates quoted by a common carrier for tariffed telecommunications services are considered to be prices set by regulation within the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 3703. This is true even if the tariff is set after execution of the contract.

(b) Rates or preliminary estimates quoted by a common carrier for nontariffed telecommunications services or by a noncommon carrier for any telecommunications service are not considered prices set by law or regulation.
