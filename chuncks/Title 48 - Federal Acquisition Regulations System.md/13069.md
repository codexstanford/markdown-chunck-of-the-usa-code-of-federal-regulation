####### Administrative Agreements.

(d)Matters may be resolved through administrative agreement at any stage of proceedings of a debarment action where a contractor agrees to appropriate terms. The specific effect of administrative agreements that incorporate terms regarding eligibility for DOI contracting will vary with the terms of the agreements. In general, such agreements resolve debarment concerns and thereby terminate any imposed or pending award ineligibility. In the event of an agreement, PAM will notify COs of the agreement and its terms.
