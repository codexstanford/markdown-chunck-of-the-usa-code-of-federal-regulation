####### Decision-making process.

(b)(1) Procedures shall afford the contractor, and any named affiliates, an opportunity to submit information and argument in opposition to the proposed suspension. This may be done in person, in writing or through a representative.

(2) In actions not based upon an indictment, where the contractor's submission raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed suspension and if no determination has been made, on the basis of Department of Justice advice, that substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced, the following procedures will be followed:

(i) Provide the contractor an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any person the agency presents;

(ii) A transcribed record of the proceeding will be made, unless the agency and contractor mutually agree to waive the requirement for a transcript. This transcribed record is available to the contractor at cost.
