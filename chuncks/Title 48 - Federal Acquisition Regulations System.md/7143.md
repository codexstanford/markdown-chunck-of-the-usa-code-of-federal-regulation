###### 225.770-4 Identifying items covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL.
####### e.g.,

(b) The USML includes defense articles and defense services that fall into 21 categories. The CCL includes ten categories and five product groups in each category, many of which contain 600 series items. Since not all items covered by the USML or 600 series of the CCL are themselves munitions (protective personnel equipment, military training equipment), the requiring activity should consult the USML and the 600 series of the CCL before concluding that an item is or is not covered. See PGI 225.770-4.
