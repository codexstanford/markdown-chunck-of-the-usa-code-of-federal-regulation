###### 719.273-4 Eligibility of Mentor and Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms.

Eligible business entities approved as Mentors may enter into agreements (hereafter referred to as "Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Agreement" or "Agreement" and explained in section 719.273-6) with eligible Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s to perform as contractors and/or subcontractors. Eligible small business entities capable of providing developmental assistance may be approved as Mentors. Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s may participate in the Program in pursuit of a prime contract or as subcontractors under the Mentor's prime contract with the USAID, but are not required to be a subcontractor to a USAID prime contractor or be a USAID prime contractor. Notwithstanding eligibility requirements in this section, USAID reserves the right to limit the number of participants in the Program in order to insure its effective management of the Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program.
