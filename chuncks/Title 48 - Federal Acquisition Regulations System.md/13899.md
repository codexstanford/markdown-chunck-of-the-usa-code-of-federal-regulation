(3) Foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s and mentors.

(b) Under the Program, eligible entities approved as mentors will enter into mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreements with eligible prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. NASA may provide the mentor award fee incentives.
