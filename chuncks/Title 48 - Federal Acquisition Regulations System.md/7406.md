###### 225.7704-2 Applicability of Balance of Payments Program.

The Deputy Secretary of Defense has determined, because of importance to national security, that it would be inconsistent with the public interest to apply the provisions of the Balance of Payments Program (see subpart 225.75) to offers of end products other than arms, ammunition, and war materials (i.e., end products listed in 225.401-70) and construction materials from the SC/CASA states that are being acquired by or on behalf of DoD in direct support of operations in Afghanistan.
