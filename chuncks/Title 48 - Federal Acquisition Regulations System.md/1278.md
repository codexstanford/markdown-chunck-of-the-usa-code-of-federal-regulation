####### Notice of suspension.

(c)When a contractor and any specifically named affiliates are suspended, they shall be immediately advised by certified mail, return receipt requested-

(1) That they have been suspended and that the suspension is based on an indictment or other adequate evidence that the contractor has committed irregularities (i) of a serious nature in business dealings with the Government or (ii) seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Government dealings with the contractor-any such irregularities shall be described in terms sufficient to place the contractor on notice without disclosing the Government's evidence;

(2) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation and such legal proceedings as may ensue;

(3) Of the cause(s) relied upon under 9.407-2 for imposing suspension;

(4) Of the effect of the suspension;

(5) That, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the contractor may submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the suspension, including any additional specific information that raises a genuine dispute over the material facts; and

(6) That additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts will be conducted unless (i) the action is based on an indictment or (ii) a determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice advice, that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.
