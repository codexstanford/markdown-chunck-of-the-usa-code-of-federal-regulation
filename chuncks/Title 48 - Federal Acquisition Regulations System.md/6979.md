###### 219.7102 General.

The Program includes-

(a) Mentor firms and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms that meet the criteria in appendix I, section I-102;

(b) Mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; agreements that establish a developmental assistance program for a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firm;

The DoD Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)), provides this preliminary assessment, which is a benefit of program participation; and

(d) Incentives that DoD may provide to mentor firms, which include-

(1) Reimbursement for developmental assistance costs through-

(i) A separately priced contract line item on a DoD contract; or

(ii) A separate contract, upon written determination by the Director, OSBP, of the cognizant military department or defense agency that unusual circumstances justify reimbursement using a separate contract; or

(2) Credit toward applicable subcontracting goals, established under a subcontracting plan negotiated under FAR subpart 19.7 or under the DoD Comprehensive Subcontracting Test Program, for developmental assistance costs that are not reimbursed.
