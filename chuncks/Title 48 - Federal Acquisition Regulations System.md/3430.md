####### e.g.

(1) Negotiate and resolve the cost impact (see 30.606). If necessary, the CFAO may request the contractor submit a revised GDM proposal by a specified date, with specific additional data needed to resolve the cost impact (, an expanded sample of affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts or a revised method of computing the increase or decrease in contract and subcontract price and cost accumulations); or

(2) Request that the contractor submit a DCI proposal by a specified date if the CFAO determines that the GDM proposal is not sufficient to resolve the cost impact.
