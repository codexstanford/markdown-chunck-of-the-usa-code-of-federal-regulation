(a) DOE sites and facilities are managed and operated on behalf of the Department of Energy by a contractor, pursuant to management and operating contracts that are generally awarded for a five (5) year term, with the possibility for renewal. Special provisions relating to patent rights are appropriately incorporated into an M&O contract because of the unique circumstances and responsibilities of managing and operating a Government-owned facility, as compared to other federally funded research and development contracts.
