####### Notice and proposal preparation.

(c)(1) When a contractor makes a unilateral change, the clause at 52.230-6, Administration of Cost Accounting Standards, requires the contractor to-

(i) Submit a description of the change to the CFAO not less than 60 days (or other mutually agreeable date) before implementation of the change; and

(ii) Submit rationale to support any contractor written statement that the cost impact of the change is immaterial.

(2) If a contractor implements the change in cost accounting practice without submitting the notice as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this subsection, the CFAO may determine the change a failure to follow a cost accounting practice consistently and process it as a noncompliance in accordance with 30.605.
