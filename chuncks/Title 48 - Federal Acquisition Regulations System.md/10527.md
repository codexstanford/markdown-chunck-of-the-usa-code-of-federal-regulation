The USAID Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program is designed to assist small business, including veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small socially and economically disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business in enhancing their capabilities to perform contracts and sub-contracts for USAID and other Federal agencies. The Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program is also designed to improve the performance of USAID contractors and subcontractors by providing developmental assistance to Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; entities, fostering the establishment of long-term business relationships between small business and prime contractors, and increasing the overall number of small business that receive USAID contract and subcontract awards. A firm's status as a Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; under a USAID contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.
