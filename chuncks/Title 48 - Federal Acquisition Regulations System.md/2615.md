The contracting officer shall take the following steps to ensure that service employees are notified of minimum wages and fringe benefits.

(a) As soon as possible after contract award, inform the contractor of the labor standards requirements of the contract relating to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and of the contractor's responsibilities under these requirements, unless it is clear that the contractor is fully informed.

(c) Attach any applicable wage determination to Publication WH-1313.
