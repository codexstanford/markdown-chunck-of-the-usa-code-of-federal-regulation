##### 9904.413-40 Fundamental requirement.
###### Allocation of pension cost to segments.

(c)Contractors shall allocate pension costs to each segment having participants in a pension plan.

(1) A separate calculation of pension costs for a segment is required when the conditions set forth in 9904.413-50(c)(2) or (3) are present. When these conditions are not present, allocations may be made by calculating a composite pension cost for two or more segments and allocating this cost to these segments by means of an allocation base.

(2) When pension costs are separately computed for a segment or segments, the provisions of Cost Accounting Standard 9904.412 regarding the assignable cost limitation shall be based on the actuarial value of assets, actuarial accrued liability and normal cost for the segment or segments for purposes of such computations. In addition, for purposes of 9904.412-50(c)(2)(iii), the amount of pension cost assignable to a segment or segments shall not exceed the sum of:

(i) The maximum tax-deductible amount computed for the plan as a whole, and

(ii) The accumulated value of prepayment credits not already allocated to segments apportioned among the segment(s).
