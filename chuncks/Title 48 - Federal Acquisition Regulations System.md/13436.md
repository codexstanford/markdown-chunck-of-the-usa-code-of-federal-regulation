###### 1516.303-76 Fee on cost-sharing contracts by subcontractors.

(a) Subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts who do not have a significant direct interest in the contract or who are not in a position to gain long-term benefits from the contract may earn a fee.

(b) Contracting Officers should be alert to a potential vulnerability for the Government under cost-sharing contracts when evaluating proposed subcontractors or consenting to a subcontract during contract administration, where the subcontractor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the prime. The vulnerability consists of the subsidiary earning a large amount of fee, which could be returned to the prime through stock dividends or other intercompany transactions. This could circumvent the objective of a cost-sharing contract.
