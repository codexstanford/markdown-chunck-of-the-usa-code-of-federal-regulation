## Chapter 16 - Office of Personnel Management Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation
### Subchapter B - Acquisition Planning
#### PART 1605 - PUBLICIZING CONTRACT ACTIONS
##### 1605.000 Applicability.

FAR part 5 has no practical application to the FEHBP because OPM does not issue solicitations. Eligible contractors (i.e., qualified health benefits carriers) are identified in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8903. Offerors voluntarily come forth in accordance with procedures provided in 5 CFR part 890.
