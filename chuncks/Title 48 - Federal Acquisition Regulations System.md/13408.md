When a solicitation and all amendments are posted on the Internet with a synopsis providing information as to how to access the solicitation and all amendments, the CO will need to maintain a mailing list of only those individuals requesting paper copies from the contract service center/branch. When possible, the CO should also build an electronic "mailing list" of companies downloading the solicitation from the Internet.
