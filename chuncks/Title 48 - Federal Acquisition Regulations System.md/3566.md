####### Cooperative arrangements.

(e)(1) IR&D costs may be incurred by contractors working jointly with one or more non-Federal entities pursuant to a cooperative arrangement (for example, joint ventures, limited partnerships, teaming arrangements, and collaboration and consortium arrangements). IR&D costs also may include costs contributed by contractors in performing cooperative research and development agreements, or similar arrangements, entered into under-

(i) Section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Transfer Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710(a));

(ii) Sections 203(c) (5) and (6) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2473(c) (5) and (6));

(iii) 10 U.S.C. 4021for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; or

(iv) Other equivalent authority.

(2) IR&D costs incurred by a contractor pursuant to these types of cooperative arrangements should be considered as allowable IR&D costs if the work performed would have been allowed as contractor IR&D had there been no cooperative arrangement.

(3) Costs incurred in preparing, submitting, and supporting offers on potential cooperative arrangements are allowable to the extent they are allocable, reasonable, and not otherwise unallowable.
