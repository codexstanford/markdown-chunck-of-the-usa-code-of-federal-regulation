###### 1852.228-70 Aircraft ground and flight risk.

As prescribed in 1828.370(a), insert the following clause. The purpose of this clause is to have the Government assume risks that generally entail unusually high insurance premiums and are not covered by the contractor's contents, work-in-process, and similar insurance. Since the definitions in the clause may not cover every situation that should be covered to achieve this purpose, the clause may be modified as follows: If the contract covers helicopters, vertical take-off aircraft, lighter-than-air airships, or other nonconventional types of aircraft, the definition of "aircraft" should be modified to specify that the aircraft has reached a point of manufacture comparable to that specified in the standard definition, which is written for conventional winged aircraft. The definition of "in the open" may be modified to include "hush houses," test hangars, comparable structures, and other designated areas. In addition, clause paragraph (d)(3) may be modified to provide for Government assumption of risk of transportation by conveyance on streets or highways if the contracting officer determines that this transportation is limited to the vicinity of the contractor's premises and is merely incident to work being performed under the contract.
