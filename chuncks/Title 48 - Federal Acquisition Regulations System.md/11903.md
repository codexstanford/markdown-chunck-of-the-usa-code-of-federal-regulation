###### 970.2702-3 Patent indemnity.

(a) Contracting officers must use the clause at 970.5227-6, Patent Indemnity-Subcontracts to assure that subcontracts appropriately address patent indemnity.

(b) Normally, the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-3 would not be appropriate for an M&O contract; however, if there is a question, such as when the mission of the contractor involves production, the contracting officer must consult with local patent counsel and use the clause where appropriate.
