(b)(1) Under cost-reimbursement research and development contracts with universities, colleges, or other educational institutions (41 U.S.C. 4708), payment for reimbursable indirect costs may be made on the basis of predetermined final indirect cost rates. The cognizant agency is not required to establish predetermined rates, but if theyestablished, their use must be extended to all the institution's Government contracts.

(2) In deciding whether the use of predetermined rates would be appropriate for the educational institution concerned, the agency should consider both the stability of the institution's indirect costs and bases over a period of years and any anticipated changes in the amount of the direct and indirect costs.

(3) Unless their use is approved at a level in the agency (see subparagraph (a)(2) above) higher than the contracting officer, predetermined rates shall not be used when-

(i) There has been no recent audit of the indirect costs;

(ii) There have been frequent or wide fluctuations in the indirect cost rates and the bases over a period of years; or

(iii) The estimated reimbursable costs for any individual contract are expected to exceed $1 million annually.

(4)(i) If predetermined rates are to be used and no rates have been previously established for the institution's current fiscal year, the agency shall obtain from the institution a proposal for predetermined rates.
