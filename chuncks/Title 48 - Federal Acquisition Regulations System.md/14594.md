If the contracting officer orders the correction of a deficiency or a modification of the contractor's services and/or quality assurance program pursuant to this paragraph after the contract year has begun, the costs incurred in correcting the deficiency or making the modification will not be considered to the contractor's detriment in the cost control factor of the service charge [if applicable] for the following contract year. However, if there is a deficiency, the deficiency itself may be taken into consideration.
