##### 470.202 Acquisition of commodities for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) programs.
###### Use of other than lowest landed cost.

(3)In order to ensure that commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations and without damage, the Department may complete an acquisition without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if:

(i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or

(ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:

(A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;

(B) A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect commodities) and other similar factors will adversely affect the delivery of such commodities without damage or in a timely manner. Such similar factors include, but are not limited to: port congestion; overloaded facilities at the port; vessels would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay; labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and other supporting facilities;

(C) The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the ability of the Department to achieve timely delivery of the commodity; or

(D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured.

(4) If the contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer shall provide to the head of contracting activity designee and to USAID, a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis. The head of contracting authority designee, or one level above the contracting officer, with the concurrence of USAID, shall, on an expedited basis, either accept or reject this request and shall document this determination in writing and provide a copy to USAID.
