####### Use of noncommission-paying media.

(c)Some media do not grant advertising agencies a commission or discount, meaning the Government can obtain the same rate as the advertising agency. If the advertising agency agrees to place advertisements in noncommission-paying media as a no-cost service, the basic ordering agreement shall so provide. If the advertising agency will not agree to place advertisements at no cost, the agreement shall-

(1) Provide that the Government may place orders directly with the media; or

(2) Specify an amount that the Government will pay if the agency places the orders.
