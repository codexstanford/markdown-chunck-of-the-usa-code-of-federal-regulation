###### 649.101-70 Termination action decisions after debarment.
####### Termination for default.

(b)Termination for default under a contract's default clause is appropriate when the circumstances giving rise to the debarment or suspension also constitute a default in the contractor's performance of that contract. Debarment or suspension of the contractor for reasons unrelated to the performance of that contract may not support a termination for default.
