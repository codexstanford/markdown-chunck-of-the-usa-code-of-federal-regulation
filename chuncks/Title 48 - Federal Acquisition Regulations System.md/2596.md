###### 22.1008-2 Successorship with incumbent contractor collective bargaining agreement.

(a) Early in the acquisition cycle, the contracting officer shall determine whether 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) affects the new acquisition. The contracting officer shall determine whether there is a predecessor contract covered by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and, if so, whether the incumbent prime contractor or its subcontractors and any of their employees have a collective bargaining agreement.

(b) 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) provides that a successor contractor must pay wages and fringe benefits (including accrued wages and benefits and prospective increases) to service employees at least equal to those agreed upon by a predecessor contractor under the following conditions:

(1) The services to be furnished under the proposed contract will be substantially the same as services being furnished by an incumbent contractor whose contract the proposed contract will succeed.

(2) The services will be performed in the same locality.

(3) The incumbent prime contractor or subcontractor is furnishing such services through the use of service employees whose wages and fringe benefits are the subject of one or more collective bargaining agreements.

(c) The application of 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) is subject to the following limitations:

(1) 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) will not apply if the incumbent contractor enters into a collective bargaining agreement for the first time and the agreement does not become effective until after the expiration of the incumbent's contract.

(2) If the incumbent contractor enters into a new or revised collective bargaining agreement during the period of the incumbent's performance on the current contract, the terms of the new or revised agreement shall not be effective for the purposes of 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) under the following conditions:

(i)(A) In sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify bidders (see 22.1012-2(a)); or

(B) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement after award, provided that the start of performance is within 30 days of award (see 22.1012-2(b)); and

(ii) The contracting officer has given both the incumbent contractor and its employees' collective bargaining agent timely written notification of the applicable acquisition dates (see 22.1010).

(d)(1) If 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) applies, the contracting officer shall obtain a copy of any collective bargaining agreement between an incumbent contractor or subcontractor and its employees. Obtaining a copy of an incumbent contractor's collective bargaining agreement may involve coordination with the administrative contracting officer responsible for administering the predecessor contract. (Paragraph (m) of the clause at 52.222-41, Service Contract Labor Standards, requires the incumbent prime contractor to furnish the contracting officer a copy of each collective bargaining agreement.)
