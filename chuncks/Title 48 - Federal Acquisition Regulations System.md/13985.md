In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2465d, NASA shall not take title to launch vehicles under contracts for launch services unless one of the exceptions in the law applies. However, the law does not eliminate NASA's right to take title to other property acquired or produced by the contractor under a contract containing a title provision.
