## Chapter 16 - Office of Personnel Management Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation
### Subchapter C - Contracting Methods and Contract Types
#### PART 1615 - CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION
##### Subpart 1615.2 - Solicitations and Receipt of Proposals and Information
###### 1615.270 Applicability.

FAR subpart 15.2 has no practical application to the FEHB Program because OPM does not issue formal procurement solicitations to health benefits carriers. Eligible contractors (i.e., qualified health benefits carriers) are identified in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8903. Offerors voluntarily come forth in accordance with procedures provided in 5 CFR part 890.
