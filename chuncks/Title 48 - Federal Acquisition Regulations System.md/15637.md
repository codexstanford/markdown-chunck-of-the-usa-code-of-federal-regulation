(f)

(1) An award term is contingent upon a continuing need for the supplies or services and the availability of funds. Award terms may be cancelled prior to the start of the period of performance at no cost to the Federal government if there is not a continued need or available funding.

(2) The extension or reduction of the contract term is affected by a unilateral contract modification.

(3) Award-term periods occur after the period for which the award term was granted. Award-term periods effectively move option periods to later contract performance periods.

(4) Contractors have the right to decline the award of an award-term period. A contractor loses its ability to earn additional award terms if an earned Award-Term Period is declined.

(5) Changes to the contract award-term plan must be mutually agreed upon.
