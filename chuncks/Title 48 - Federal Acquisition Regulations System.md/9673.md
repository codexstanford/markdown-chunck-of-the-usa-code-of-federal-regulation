(a) Except for paragraph (b) of this section, GSAR provisions and clauses should be incorporated by reference to the maximum practical extent, rather than being incorporated in full text. Upon request, the contracting officer shall provide the full text of any GSAR provision or clause incorporated by reference.

(b) A GSAR provision or clause should be incorporated in full text if-

(1) It requires modification or completion by the Government (e.g., completion of blanks in provisions or clauses) (see FAR 52.104 and 552.104);

(2) It requires completion by the offeror or contractor;

(3) It is identified as a deviation that has not been incorporated into the GSAM or FAR, as applicable (e.g., acquisition letter) (see 501.370(a)); or

(4) It is used with one or more alternates.
