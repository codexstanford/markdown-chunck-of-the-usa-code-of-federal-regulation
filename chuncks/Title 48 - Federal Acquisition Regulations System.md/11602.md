###### 927.404 Rights in technical data in subcontracts. (DOE coverage - paragraphs (g), (k), (l), and (m))

(g)(4) Contractors are required by paragraph (d)(3) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, as modified pursuant to 48 CFR 927.409(a)(1), to acquire permission from DOE to assert copyright in any computer software first produced in the performance of the contract. This requirement reflects DOE's established software distribution program, recognized at FAR 27.404(g)(2), and the Department's statutory dissemination obligations. When a contractor requests permission to assert copyright in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of the Rights in Data-General clause as prescribed for use at 48 CFR 927.409(a)(1), Patent Counsel shall predicate its decision on the considerations reflected in paragraph (e) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2 Rights in Data-Technology Transfer.
