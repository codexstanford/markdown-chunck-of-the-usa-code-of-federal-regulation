####### Investigation and referral.

(a)(1) Refer to the Suspension and Debarment Official matters involving serious contract improprieties or performance deficiencies. Performance deficiencies that continue over a period of time or apply to more than one contract may warrant debarment consideration.

(2) Refer possible criminal or fraudulent activities to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). See 5 CFR 6701.107, Reporting Waste, Fraud, Abuse, and Corruption. If, after investigation, the OIG believes a cause for debarment exists, it will refer the matter to the Suspension and Debarment Official for consideration of debarment action.
