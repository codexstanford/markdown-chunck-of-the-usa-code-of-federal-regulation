##### 32.004 Contract performance in foreign countries.

The enforceability of contract provisions for security of Government financing in a foreign jurisdiction is dependent upon local law and procedure. Prior to providing contract financing where foreign jurisdictions may become involved, the contracting officer shall ensure the Government's security is enforceable. This may require the provision of additional or different security than that normally provided for in the standard contract clauses.
