###### 1632.770 Contingency reserve payments.

(a) Payments from the contingency reserve shall be made in accordance with 5 CFR 890.503.

(b) A carrier for an FEHB plan may apply to OPM at any time for a payment from the contingency reserve that is in addition to those amounts, if any, paid under 5 CFR 890.503(c)(1) through (c)(4), if the carrier can show good cause, such as, unexpected adverse claims experience. OPM will decide whether to allow the request in whole or in part and will advise the carrier of its decision. However, OPM shall not unreasonably withhold approval for amounts requested that exceed the plan's preferred minimum balance for the contingency reserve.
