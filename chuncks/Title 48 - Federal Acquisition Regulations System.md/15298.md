## Chapter 30 - Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR)
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 3001 - FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS SYSTEM
##### Subpart 3001.3 - Agency Acquisition Regulations
###### 3001.303 Publication and codification.

(a) The HSAR is issued as chapter 30 of Title 48 of the CFR.

(1) The FAR numbering illustrations at (FAR) 48 CFR 1.105-2 apply to the HSAR.

(2) Coverage within HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30 is identified by the prefix "30" followed by the complete FAR cite which may extend downward to the subparagraph level (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3001.101).

(3) Coverage in HSAR chapter 30 that supplements the FAR will use part, subpart, section, and subsection numbers ending in "70" through "89". A series of numbers beginning with "70" is used for provisions and clauses (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3001.301-70).

(4) Coverage in HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30, other than that identified with a "70" or higher number, which implements the FAR uses the identical number sequence and caption of the FAR segment being implemented which may extend downward to the subparagraph level. Subparagraph numbers/letters may not be shown as sequential, but may be shown by the specific paragraph/subparagraph implemented from the FAR (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3003.301 contains subparagraphs (a) and (b) because only these subparagraphs, correlating to FAR, are being supplemented by (HSAR) 48 CFR chapter 30).
