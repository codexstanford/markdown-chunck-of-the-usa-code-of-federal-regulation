This section applies to reviews and protests of a small business concern's SDB status as a prime contractor or subcontractor.

(b) Requests for an SBA review of SDB status may be forwarded to the Small Business Administration, Assistant Administrator for SDBCE, 409 Third Street SW., Washington, DC 20416.

Protests of a concern's size as a prime contractor are processed under 19.302. Protests of a concern's size as a subcontractor are processed under 19.703(b).
