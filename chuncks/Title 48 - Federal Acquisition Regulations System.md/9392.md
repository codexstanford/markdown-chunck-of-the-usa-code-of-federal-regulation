###### Use of other than lowest landed cost.

(3)In order to ensure that commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations and without damage, the contracting officer may award an acquisition without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if:

(i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or

(ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:

(A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;

(B) A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect commodities) and other similar factors may adversely affect the delivery of such commodities through damage or untimely delivery. Such similar factors include, but are not limited to: port congestion; overloaded facilities at the port; vessels not being able to dock and load cargo without delay due to conditions at the port; labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and other supporting facilities;

(C) The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the timely delivery of the commodity;

(D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured; or

(E) The contracting officer determines that extenuating circumstances preclude awards on the basis of lowest-landed cost, or that efficiency and cost-savings justify use of types of ocean service that would not involve an analysis of freight. However, in all such cases, commodities would be transported in compliance with cargo preference requirements. Examples of extenuating circumstances are events such as internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatening the lives of persons at the foreign destination. Other types of services may include, but are not limited to, multi-trip voyage charters, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), delivery cost and freight (C & F), delivery cost insurance and freight (CIF), and indexed ocean freight costs.

(4) If a contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer will provide to the Head of Contracting Activity Designee a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis consistent with Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis. The Head of the Contracting Activity Designee, or the designee one level above the contracting officer, may either accept or reject this request and shall document this determination.
