###### 970.2703-2 Patent rights clause provisions for management and operating contractors.
####### Allocation of Principal Rights: Government title.

(b)(1) The patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-11 must be incorporated into the M&O contract if the contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the contract does not have a technology transfer mission or if, without regard to the type of contractor, the contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs. That clause provides for DOE's statutory obligation to take title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under an M&O contract, and does not contemplate an advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions, or participation by the contractor in technology transfer activities.

(2) While only in rare circumstances does a for-profit large business contractor whose contract contains no technology transfer mission receive rights in or title to inventions made under the contract, the contractor does have the right to request a license or foreign patent rights in inventions made under the contract, and may petition for a waiver of Government rights in identified inventions. The patent rights clause 970.5227-11 does not include many of the provisions of patent rights clauses 970.5227-10 and 970.5227-12, related to the filing of patent applications by the contractor, the granting of rights in inventions by the contractor to third parties (preference for United States industry), and conditions allowing the Government to grant licenses to third parties in inventions retained by the contractor (march-in rights). Any instrument granting rights in inventions made under a contract governed by patent rights clause 970.5227-11 must include these additional provisions within its terms and conditions.
