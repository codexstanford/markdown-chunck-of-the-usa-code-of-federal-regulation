(2)This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Since the acquisition value is less than $50,000 and the acquisition is set aside, none of the trade agreements apply. Perform the steps in 25.502(a). Offers B and C are initially evaluated as foreign end products, because they are the products of small businesses but are not domestic end products (25.502(c)(4)). Offer C is the low offer. After applying the 30 percent factor, the evaluated price of Offer C is $13,130. The resulting evaluated price of $13,130 remains lower than Offer A. The cost of Offer A is therefore unreasonable. Offer B is then treated as a domestic offer, because it is for a U.S.-made end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content (25.106(b)(2)). Offer B is determined reasonable because it is lower than the $13,130 evaluated price of Offer C. Award on Offer B at $12,500.
