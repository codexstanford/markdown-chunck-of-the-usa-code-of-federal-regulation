(a) The contracting officer shall insert the following clauses, appropriately modified with respect to payment due dates, in accordance with agency regulations-

(2) The clause at 52.232-2, Payment under Fixed-Price Research and Development Contracts, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price research and development contract is contemplated;

(3) The clause at 52.232-3, Payments under Personal Services Contracts, in solicitations and contracts for personal services;

(4) The clause at 52.232-4, Payments under Transportation Contracts and Transportation-Related Services Contracts, in solicitations and contracts for transportation or transportation-related services;

(5) The clause at 52.232-5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, in solicitations and contracts for construction when a fixed-price contract is contemplated;

The contracting officer shall ensure that the modification specifies the percentage and total amount of the withheld payment.
