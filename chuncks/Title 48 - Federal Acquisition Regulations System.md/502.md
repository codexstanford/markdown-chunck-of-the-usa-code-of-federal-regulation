####### e.g.,

(a) In order to be eligible for contract award, an offeror must represent that it will not require its employees or subcontractors to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse related to the performance of a Government contract to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information (agency Office of the Inspector General). Any offeror that does not so represent is ineligible for award of a contract.

(b) The contracting officer may rely on an offeror's representation unless the contracting officer has reason to question the representation.
