####### Application.

(b)This authority may be used for any acquisition when disclosure of the Government's needs would compromise the national security (e.g., would violate security requirements); it shall not be used merely because the acquisition is classified, or merely because access to classified matter will be necessary to submit a proposal or to perform the contract.
