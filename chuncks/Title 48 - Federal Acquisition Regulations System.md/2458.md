###### 22.404-9 Award of contract without required wage determination.

(a) If a contract is awarded without the required wage determination (i.e., incorporating no determination, containing a clearly inapplicable general wage determination, or containing a project determination which is inapplicable because of an inaccurate description of the project or its location), the contracting officer shall initiate action to incorporate the required determination in the contract immediately upon discovery of the error. If a required wage determination (valid determination in effect on the date of award) is not available, the contracting officer shall expeditiously request a wage determination from the Department of Labor, including a statement explaining the crcumstances and giving the date of the contract award.

(b) The contracting officer shall-

(1) Modify the contract to incorporate the required wage determination (retroactive to the date of award), and equitably adjust the contract price if appropriate; or

(2) Terminate the contract.
