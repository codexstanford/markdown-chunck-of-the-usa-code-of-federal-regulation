(3) The noncompetitive award of contracts, task orders or other NRC work assignments where the particular assignment is to be performed by designated former NRC employees, including principal investigators, key personnel, and others who will perform more than a nominal amount of the work in question.

(b) The following procurement actions are considered noncompetitive for the purposes of this policy:

(1) Contracts awarded noncompetitively under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program;

(2) Individual task orders if the former employee was not identified as "key personnel" in a proposal which was evaluated under competitive procedures;
