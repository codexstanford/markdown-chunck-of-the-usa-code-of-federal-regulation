####### Sole source award where the contracting officer nominates a specific 8(a) participant.

(1)SBA will determine whether an appropriate match exists where the contracting officer identifies a particular participant for a sole source award.

(i) Once SBA determines that a procurement is suitable to be accepted as an 8(a) sole source contract, SBA will normally accept it on behalf of the 8(a) participant recommended by the contracting officer, provided that the 8(a) participant complies with the requirements of 13 CFR 124.503(c)(1).

(ii) If an appropriate match does not exist, SBA will notify the 8(a) participant and the contracting officer, and may then nominate an alternate 8(a) participant.
