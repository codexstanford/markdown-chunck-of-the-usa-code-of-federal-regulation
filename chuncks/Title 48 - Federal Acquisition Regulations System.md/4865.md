###### 48.104-2 Sharing acquisition savings.
####### Construction contracts.

(b)Sharing on construction contracts applies only to savings on the instant contract and to collateral savings. The Government's share of savings is determined by subtracting Government costs from instant contract savings and multiplying the result by (1) 45 percent for fixed-price contracts; or (2) 75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts. Value engineering sharing does not apply to incentive construction contracts.
