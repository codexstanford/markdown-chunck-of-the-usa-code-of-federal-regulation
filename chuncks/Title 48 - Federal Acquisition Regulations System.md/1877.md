###### 16.306 Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.
####### Application.

(b)(1) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is suitable for use when the conditions of 16.301-2 are present and, for example-

(i) The contract is for the performance of research or preliminary exploration or study, and the level of effort required is unknown; or

(ii) The contract is for development and test, and using a cost-plus- incentive-fee contract is not practical.

(2) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract normally should not be used in development of major systems (see part 34) once preliminary exploration, studies, and risk reduction have indicated a high degree of probability that the development is achievable and the Government has established reasonably firm performance objectives and schedules.
