####### Failure to certify.

(c)(1) If the contractor has not certified its proposal for final indirect cost rates and a waiver is not appropriate, the contracting officer may unilaterally establish the rates.

(i) Based on audited historical data or other available data as long as unallowable costs are excluded; and

(ii) Set low enough to ensure that unallowable costs will not be reimbursed.
