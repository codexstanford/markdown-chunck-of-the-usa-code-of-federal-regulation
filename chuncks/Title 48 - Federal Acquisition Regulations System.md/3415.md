####### Procedures.

(b)Upon receipt of the contractor's notification and description of the change in cost accounting practice, the CFAO should review the proposed change concurrently for adequacy and compliance. The CFAO shall-

(1) If the description of the change is both adequate and compliant, notify the contractor in writing and-

(i) For required or unilateral changes (except those requested to be determined desirable changes), request the contractor submit a general dollar magnitude (GDM) proposal by a specified date, unless the CFAO determines the cost impact is immaterial; or

(ii) For unilateral changes that the contractor requests to be determined desirable changes, inform the contractor that the request shall include supporting rationale and-

(A) For any request based on the criteria in 30.603-2(b)(3)(ii), the data necessary to demonstrate the required cost savings; or

(B) For any request other than those based on the criteria in 30.603-2(b)(3)(ii), a GDM proposal and any other data necessary for the CFAO to determine if the change is a desirable change;

(2) If the description of the change is inadequate, request a revised description of the new cost accounting practice; and

(3) If the disclosed practice is noncompliant, notify the contractor in writing that, if implemented, the CFAO will determine the cost accounting practice to be noncompliant and process it accordingly.
