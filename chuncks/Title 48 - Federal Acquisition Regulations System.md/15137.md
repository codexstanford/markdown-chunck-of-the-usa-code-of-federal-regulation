Before awarding a contract, the contracting officer must make a written determination of the otherwise successful bidder's/offeror's responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.105. In addition to past performance information, the contracting officer must insure that the proposed contractor, and any subcontractor representing more than $25,000 in goods or services, does not appear in the "List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement" (available on the Internet at). In addition, contracting officers should base their determination of contractor responsibility on a review of the company's "Summary or Financial Report" from Dun & Bradstreet (available on the Internet for a fee at).
