###### 719.273-5 Selection of Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms.

(a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms. Mentors are encouraged to select from a broad base of small business including small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and HUBZone firms whose core competencies support USAID's mission.

(b) Mentors may have multiple Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s. However, to preserve the integrity of the Program and assure the quality of developmental assistance provided to Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s, USAID reserves the right to limit the total number of Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s participating under each Mentor firm for the Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program.

(c) The selection of Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; firms by Mentor firms may not be protested, except that any protest regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a Mentor shall be handled in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Small Business Administration regulations.
