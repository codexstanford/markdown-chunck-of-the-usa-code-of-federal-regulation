####### Correcting mistakes.

(b)(1) A contract may be amended or modified to correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake. The following are examples of mistakes that may make such action appropriate:

(i) A mistake or ambiguity consisting of the failure to express, or express clearly, in a written contract, the agreement as both parties understood it.

(ii) A contractor's mistake so obvious that it was or should have been apparent to the contracting officer.

(iii) A mutual mistake as to a material fact.

(2) Amending contracts to correct mistakes with the least possible delay normally will facilitate the national defense by expediting the contracting program and assuring contractors that mistakes will be corrected expeditiously and fairly.
