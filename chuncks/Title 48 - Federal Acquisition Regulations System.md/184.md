####### Forward pricing rate agreement

means a written agreement negotiated between a contractor and the Government to make certain rates available during a specified period for use in pricing contracts or modifications.

These projections may include rates for such things as labor, indirect costs, material obsolescence and usage, spare parts provisioning, and material handling.
