###### 19.301-2 Rerepresentation by a contractor that represented itself as a small business concern.
####### Contract rerepresentation.

(d)(1)After a contractor rerepresents for a contract that it no longer qualifies as a small business concern identified in 19.000(a)(3) in accordance with 52.219-28, the agency may no longer include the value of options exercised, modifications issued, orders issued, or purchases made under BPAs on that contract in its small business prime contracting goal achievements. When a contractor's rerepresentation for a contract qualifies it as a different small business concern identified in 19.000(a)(3) than what it represented for award, the agency may include the value of options exercised, modifications issued, orders issued, or purchases made under BPAs on that contract in its small business prime contracting goal achievements, consistent with the rerepresentation. Agencies should issue a modification to the contract capturing the rerepresentation and report it to FPDS within 30 days after notification of the rerepresentation.
