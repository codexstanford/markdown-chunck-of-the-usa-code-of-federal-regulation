(a) The clause at 252.227-7015, Technical Data-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, provides the Government specific license rights in technical data pertaining to commercial products, commercial services, or commercial processes. DoD may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose data only within the Government. The data may not be used to manufacture additional quantities of the commercial products and, except for emergency repair or overhaul and for covered Government support contractors, may not be released or disclosed to, or used by, third parties without the contractor's written permission. Those restrictions do not apply to the technical data described in 227.7102-1(a).
