(2) NAICS codes are updated by the Office of Management and Budget through its Economic Classification Policy Committee every five years. New NAICS codes are not available for use in Federal contracting until SBA publishes corresponding size standards. NAICS codes are available from the U.S. Census Bureau at.

(3) SBA determines the size status of a concern, including its affiliates, as of the date the concern represents that it is small to the contracting officer as part of its initial offer, which includes price.

(4) When an agency uses a solicitation for a multiple-award contract that does not require offers for the contract to include price, SBA determines size as of the date of initial offer for the multiple-award contract, whether or not the offer includes price or the price is evaluated. (See 13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(iv)).
