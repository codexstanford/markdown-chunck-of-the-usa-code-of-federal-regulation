## Chapter 16 - Office of Personnel Management Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation
### Subchapter B - Acquisition Planning
#### PART 1609 - CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS
##### Subpart 1609.4 - Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility
###### 1609.470 Notification of Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility.

(FAR) 48 CFR, part 9, subpart 9.4 is supplemented as set out in the certification required in 1609.471 by converting the FAR "offeror's" certification at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.209-5 into a carrier's certification. This change reflects the FEHBP's statutory exemption from competitive bidding (5 U.S.C. 8902), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.
