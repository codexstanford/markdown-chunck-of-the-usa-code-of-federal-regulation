####### Multiple-item acquisitions.

(5)(i) If at least 50 percent of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured, processed, or produced by small business concerns, then a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule is not required. There is no requirement that each item acquired in a multiple-item acquisition be manufactured, processed, or produced by a small business in the United States or its outlying areas.

(ii) If more than 50 percent of the estimated acquisition cost is composed of items manufactured, processed, or produced by other than small business concerns, then a waiver is required. SBA may grant an individual waiver for one or more items in an acquisition in order to ensure that at least 50 percent of the cost of the items to be supplied by the nonmanufacturer comes from small business manufacturers, processors, and producers in the United States or its outlying areas or are subject to a waiver.

(iii) If a small business offeror is both a manufacturer of item(s) and a nonmanufacturer of other item(s) for an acquisition, the contracting officer shall apply the manufacturer size standard.
