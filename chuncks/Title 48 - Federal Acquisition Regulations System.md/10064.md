(c)Nothing in this section waives the requirement to obtain competition as required by FAR part 6 and DOSAR (48 CFR) part 606. Competition, including the use of written solicitation, shall be obtained in all cases to the extent feasible. If there are known U.S. firms or firms with U.S. affiliations in local residence capable of supplying the required supplies or services, the contracting activity shall ensure that those firms are included in the source list for the acquisition.
