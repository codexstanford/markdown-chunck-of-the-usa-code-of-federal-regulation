##### Service of copy.

(b)All responses submitted to the Board shall indicate that a copy has been sent to the claimant and to the Audit Division or the agency, as appropriate. To expedite proceedings, if either the Audit Division or the agency will not file a response (e.g., it believes its reasons for denying the claim were sufficiently explained in the material filed by the claimant), it should notify the Board, the claimant, and the Audit Division or the agency, as appropriate, that it does not intend to file a response.
