###### 2937.103-70 Department of Labor checklist to aid analysis and review of requirements for service contracts.
####### General.

(a)Following is a checklist to aid analysis and review of requirements for service contracts.

(1) Is the statement of work complete, with a clear-cut division of responsibility between the contracting parties?

(2) Is the statement of work discussed in terms the market can satisfy?

(3) Does the statement of work encompass all commercially available services that can meet the actual functional need (eliminates any nonessential preferences that may thwart full and open competition)?

(4) Is the statement of work performance-based to the maximum extent possible (i.e., is the acquisition structured around the purpose of the work to be performed, as opposed to either the manner by which the work is to be performed or a broad and imprecise statement of work)?
