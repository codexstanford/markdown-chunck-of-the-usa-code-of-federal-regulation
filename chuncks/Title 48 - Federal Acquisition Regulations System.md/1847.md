####### Adjustment based on established prices-standard supplies.

(a)(1) The contracting officer shall, when contracting by negotiation, insert the clause at 52.216-2, Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies, or an agency-prescribed clause as authorized in subparagraph (2) below, in solicitations and contracts when all of the following conditions apply:

(i) A fixed-price contract is contemplated.

(ii) The requirement is for standard supplies that have an established catalog or market price.

(iii) The contracting officer has made the determination specified in 16.203-3.

(2) If all the conditions in subparagraph (a)(1) above apply and the contracting officer determines that the use of the clause at 52.216-2 is inappropriate, the contracting officer may use an agency-prescribed clause instead of the clause at 52.216-2.

(3) If the negotiated unit price reflects a net price after applying a trade discount from a catalog or list price, the contracting officer shall document in the contract file both the catalog or list price and the discount. (This does not apply to prompt payment or cash discounts.)

(4) The contracting officer may modify the clause by increasing the 10 percent limit on aggregate increases specified in 52.216-2(c)(1), upon approval by the chief of the contracting office.
