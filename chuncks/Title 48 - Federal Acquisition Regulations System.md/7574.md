####### Alternatives to delivery of source code and related software design details.

(ii)The assessment of life-cycle needs should consider alternatives to the delivery of source code and related software design details for privately developed computer software as necessary to meet the Government's needs, such as-

(A) Technical data and computer software sufficient to implement a modular open system approach or a similar approach (see PGI 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(A) for guidance on alternatives to source code and related software design details);

(B) Access to technical data or computer software, including access agreements for cloud-based or subscription-based software products or services; see PGI 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) for guidance on use of access agreements to contractor source code and related software design details;

(C) Software support and maintenance provided directly from the contractor; or

(D) Other contracting or licensing mechanisms including priced options, specially negotiated licenses, direct licensing between contractors for qualifying second sources, data escrow agreements, deferred delivery solutions, and subscription agreements. See PGI 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(D) for guidance on use of escrow agreements.

(3) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for computer software or computer software documentation, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's needs with prices offered.

(c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts-

(1) Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of computer programs and computer software documentation to be delivered, any requirements for multiple users at one site or multiple site licenses, and the format and media in which the software or documentation will be delivered;

(2) Establish each type of computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by an exhibit to the contract);

(3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable item of computer software or computer software documentation under a fixed-price type contract;

(4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable item;

(5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item; and

(6) Specify in the negotiated terms that any required other than commercial computer software, related recorded information, and associated license rights identified in the assessment of life-cycle needs in paragraph (b) of this section shall to the extent appropriate-

(i) Include computer software delivered in a digital format compatible with applicable computer programs on relevant system hardware;

(ii) Not rely on additional internal or external other than commercial or commercial technical data and software, unless such technical data or software is-

(A) Included in the items to be delivered with license rights sufficient to meet the Government's needs; or

(B) Commercially available with license rights sufficient to meet the Government's needs; and

(iii) Include sufficient information, with license rights sufficient to meet the Government's needs, to support maintenance and understanding of interfaces and software version history when the negotiated terms do not allow for the inclusion of the external or additional other than commercial or commercial technical data and software.
