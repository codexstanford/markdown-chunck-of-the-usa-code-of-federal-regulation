###### 719.273-10 Internal controls.

(a) OSDBU will oversee the Program and will work in concert with the Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program Manager and relevant contracting officers to achieve Program objectives. OSDBU will establish internal controls as checks and balances applicable to the Program. These controls will include:

(1) Reviewing and evaluating Mentor applications for validity of the provided information;

(2) Reviewing annual progress reports submitted by Mentors and Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s on Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; development to measure Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; progress against the plan submitted in the approved Agreement;

(3) Reviewing and evaluating financial reports and invoices submitted by the Mentor to verify that USAID is not charged by the Mentor for providing developmental assistance to the Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;; and

(4) Limiting the number of participants in the Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program within a reporting period, in order to insure the effective management of the Program.

(b) USAID may rescind approval of an existing Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Agreement if it determines that such action is in USAID's best interest. The rescission shall be in writing and sent to the Mentor and Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; after approval by the Director of OSDBU. Rescission of an Agreement does not change the terms of any subcontract between the Mentor and the Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;.
