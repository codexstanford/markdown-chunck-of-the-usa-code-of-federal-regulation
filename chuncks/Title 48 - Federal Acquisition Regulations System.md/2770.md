####### Remedies for discrimination.

(6)(i) When the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division determines that a contractor has discriminated against an employee in violation of 29 CFR 13.6(b), the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division will notify the contractor and the relevant contracting agency of the discrimination and request that the contractor remedy the violation.

(ii) If the contractor does not remedy the violation, the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division shall direct the contractor to provide appropriate relief to the affected employee(s) in the investigative findings letter issued pursuant to 29 CFR 13.51. Such relief may include, but is not limited to-

(A) Employment;

(B) Reinstatement;

(C) Promotion; and

(D) Restoration of leave, or lost pay and/or benefits.

(iii) Payment of liquidated damages in an amount equaling any monetary relief may also be directed unless such amount is reduced by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division because the violation was in good faith and the contractor had reasonable grounds for believing the contractor had not violated the E.O. or 29 CFR part 13.

(iv) The Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division may additionally direct that payments due on the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Federal Government be withheld as may be necessary to provide any appropriate monetary relief. Upon the final order of the Secretary of Labor that monetary relief is due, the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division may direct the relevant contracting agency to transfer the withheld funds to the Department of Labor for disbursement.
