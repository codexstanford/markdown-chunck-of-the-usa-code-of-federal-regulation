(b)(1) The USAID Metric Executive (as designated in ADS Chapter 323), the contracting officer, and the USAID official who approves the procurement requirement are authorized to waive the metric requirement for one of the above reasons. The USAID Metric Executive is authorized to overrule a decision to grant a waiver, or to nullify a blanket waiver made by another approving official so long as a contractor's rights under an executed contract are not infringed upon.

(2) A blanket waiver for a class of multiple transactions may be issued for a term not to exceed three years.

(3) When a waiver will be based upon the adverse impact on U.S. firms, clearance from the USAID Metric Executive and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) will be obtained prior to authorization.
