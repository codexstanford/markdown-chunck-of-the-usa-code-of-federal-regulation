####### Competitive negotiated solicitations.

(e)(1) If a solicitation requests offerors to propose performance-based payments, the solicitation shall specify-

(i) What, if any, terms shall be included in all offers; and

(ii) The extent to which and how offeror-proposed performance-based payment terms will be evaluated. Unless agencies prescribe other evaluation procedures, if the contracting officer anticipates that the cost of providing performance-based payments would have a significant impact on determining the best value offer, the solicitation should state that the evaluation of the offeror's proposed prices will include an adjustment to reflect the estimated cost to the Government of providing each offeror's proposed performance-based payments (see Alternate I to the provision at 52.232-28).

(2) The contracting officer shall-

(i) Review the proposed terms to ensure they comply with this section; and

(ii) Use the adjustment method at 32.205(c) if the price is to be adjusted for evaluation purposes in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
