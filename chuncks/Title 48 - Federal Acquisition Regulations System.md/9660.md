Insert the clause at 552.242-70, Status Report of Orders and Shipments, in solicitations and contracts when a requirements or indefinite-quantity contract for Stock or Special Order Program items is contemplated. The clause may be used in indefinite-delivery definite-quantity contracts for Stock or Special Order Program items when close monitoring is necessary because numerous shipments are involved.
