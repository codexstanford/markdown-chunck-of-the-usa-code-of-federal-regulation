###### 19.301-2 Rerepresentation by a contractor that represented itself as a small business concern.
####### Rerepresentation for a task or delivery order.

(2)(i) When a contractor rerepresents for an order that it no longer qualifies as a small business concern identified in 19.000(a)(3), the agency cannot include the value of the order in its small business prime contracting goal achievements. When a contractor's rerepresentation for an order qualifies it as a different small business concern identified in 19.000(a)(3) than what it represented for contract award, the agency can include the value of the order in its small business prime contracting goal achievement, consistent with the rerepresentation.

(ii) A rerepresentation for an order does not change the size or socioeconomic status representation for the contract.

(e) A change in size status does not change the terms and conditions of the contract. However, the contracting officer may require a subcontracting plan for a contract containing 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, if a prime contractor's size status changes from small to other than small as a result of a size rerepresentation (see 19.705-2(b)(3)).
