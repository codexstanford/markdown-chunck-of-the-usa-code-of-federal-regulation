(m)In contracts involving access to certain categories of DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related data and technology. Accordingly, in contracts where access to such restricted data is to be provided to contractors, Alternate VII shall be incorporated into the rights in technical data clause of the contract. In addition, in any other types of contracting situations in which the contractor may be given access to restricted data, appropriate limitations on the use of such data must be specified.
