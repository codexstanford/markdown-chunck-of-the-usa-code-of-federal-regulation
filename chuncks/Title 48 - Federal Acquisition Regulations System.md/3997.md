###### 33.104 Protests to GAO.
####### Protests before award.

(b)(1) When the agency has received notice from the GAO of a protest filed directly with the GAO, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized, in accordance with agency procedures, by the head of the contracting activity, on a nondelegable basis, upon a written finding that-

(i) Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the United States will not permit awaiting the decision of the GAO; and

(ii) Award is likely to occur within 30 days of the written finding.

(2) A contract award shall not be authorized until the agency has notified the GAO of the finding in subparagraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) When a protest against the making of an award is received and award will be withheld pending disposition of the protest, the contracting officer should inform the offerors whose offers might become eligible for award of the protest. If appropriate, those offerors should be requested, before expiration of the time for acceptance of their offer, to extend the time for acceptance to avoid the need for resolicitation. In the event of failure to obtain such extensions of offers, consideration should be given to proceeding under subparagraph (b)(1) of this section.
