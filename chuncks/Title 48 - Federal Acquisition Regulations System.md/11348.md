##### Subpart 904.4 - Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry
###### 904.404 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
####### Security, 952.204-2.

(1)This clause is required in contracts and subcontracts, the performance of which involves or is likely to involve classified information, access to special nuclear materials or the provision of protective services. DOE utilizes the National Industrial Security Program but DOE's security authority is derived from the Atomic Energy Act which contains specific language not found in other agencies' authorities. For this reason, DOE contracts must contain the clause at 952.204-2 rather than the clause at 48 CFR 52.204-2.
