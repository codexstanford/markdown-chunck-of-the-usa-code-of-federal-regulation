###### 2116.270 FEGLI Program contracts.

FEGLI Program contracts are fixed price with limited cost redetermination plus fixed fee. The premium paid to the Contractor is mutually agreed upon by OPM and the Contractor and is based on an estimate of benefits and administrative costs, plus the fixed service or risk charge, and is determined annually. Claims costs, including benefits and administrative expenses, in excess of premiums are paid up to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund. Payment for costs exceeding the amount in the Fund are the responsibility of the Contractor and reinsurers. The fee is fixed at the inception of each contract year. The fee does not vary with the actual costs but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract. The fee is in the form of either a risk charge or a service charge.
