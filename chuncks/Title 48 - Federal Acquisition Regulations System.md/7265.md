(a) In accordance with Section 8041 of the Fiscal Year 1991 DoD Appropriations Act (Public Law 101-511) and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts, do not acquire welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain, four inches or less in diameter, unless-

(2) The cost of the components manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the total cost of components.
