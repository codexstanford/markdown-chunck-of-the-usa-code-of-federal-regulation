(a)(i) NASA is committed to providing to small, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns, maximum practicable opportunities to participate in Agency acquisitions at the prime contract level. The participation of NASA prime contractors in providing subcontracting opportunities to such entities is also an essential part of the Agency's commitment. The participation of these entities is emphasized in high-technology areas where they have had low involvement level.

(ii) NASA biennially negotiates Agency small business prime and subcontracting goals with the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 15(g) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644). In addition, NASA has an annual goal of five percent for prime and subcontract awards to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs), and a three percent goal for HUBZone and service-disabled, veteran-owned small business concerns.
