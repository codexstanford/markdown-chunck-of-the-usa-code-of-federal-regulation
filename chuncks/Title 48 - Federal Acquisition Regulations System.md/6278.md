####### Price risk.

(b)(1) When procuring a service or an end product identified by a material identifier that is available as described at PGI 204.7603, the contracting officer shall consider price risk assessment in determining if a proposed price is consistent with historical prices paid for an item or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. Contracting officers shall not rely solely on the price risk assessment when determining prices to be fair and reasonable.

(2) The contracting officer shall consider strategies to mitigate price risk, such as the following:

(i) Not awarding to offerors or quoters with high risk price ratings unless there is a way to justify the price through additional price or cost analysis.

(ii) Utilizing appropriate price negotiation techniques and procedures.

(iii) Using price reasonableness or price realism techniques at FAR 13.106 or 15.4. See also 215.403-3 when making award decisions.
