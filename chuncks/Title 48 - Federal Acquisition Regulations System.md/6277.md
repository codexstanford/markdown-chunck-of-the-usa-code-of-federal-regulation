####### Item risk.

(a)(1) Consider item risk to determine whether the procurement of products represents a high performance risk to the Government. If an item has a high risk rating, then the SPRS item risk report will display the reason(s) an item is identified as high risk.

(2) Before issuing a solicitation for the procurement of an end product identified by a material identifier that is available as described at PGI 204.7603, the contracting officer shall ensure a SPRS item risk search has been performed and shall consider any item risk warnings provided. When evaluating quotations or offers for an end product identified by a material identifier, a SPRS item risk search is required for any end product that did not have an item risk search performed prior to solicitation. If there are item risk warnings, the contracting officer shall consider strategies to mitigate risk, such as the following:

(i) Consulting with the program office.

(ii) Including mitigating requirements in the statement of work, as provided by the requiring activity.

(iii) Including FAR and DFARS clauses identified in the SPRS application, as appropriate.
