###### 30.603-2 Unilateral and desirable changes.
####### Desirable changes.

(b)(1) Prior to taking action under the applicable paragraph(s) addressing a desirable change at 52.230-2, 52.230-3, or 52.230-5, the CFAO shall determine the change is a desirable change and not detrimental to the interests of the Government.

(2) Until the CFAO has determined a change to a cost accounting practice is a desirable change, the change is a unilateral change.

(3) Some factors to consider in determining if a change is desirable include, but are not limited to, whether-

(i) The contractor must change the cost accounting practices it uses for Government contract and subcontract costing purposes to remain in compliance with the provisions of Part 31;

(ii) The contractor is initiating management actions directly associated with the change that will result in cost savings for segments with CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts over a period for which forward pricing rates are developed or 5 years, whichever is shorter, and the cost savings are reflected in the forward pricing rates; and

(iii) Funds are available if the determination would necessitate an upward adjustment of contract cost or price.
