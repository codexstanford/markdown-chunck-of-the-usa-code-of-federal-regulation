### PART 6101 - RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE CIVILIAN BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS
#### 6101.54 Alternative dispute resolution [Rule 54].
##### Availability.

(a)The CDA requires boards of contract appeals to provide to the fullest extent practicable informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes. Resolution of a dispute at the earliest stage feasible, by the fastest and least expensive method possible, benefits both parties. The Board provides alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services for pre-claim and pre-final decision matters, as well as appeals pending before the Board. The Board may also conduct ADR proceedings for any Federal agency. The use of ADR proceedings does not toll any statutory time limits.
