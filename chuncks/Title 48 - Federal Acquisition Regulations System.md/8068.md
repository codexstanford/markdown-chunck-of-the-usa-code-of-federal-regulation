(a) Defense Contract Management Agency administrative contracting officers are authorized to negotiate the settlement of direct and indirect costs for a specific contract, task order, or delivery order to be closed in advance of the determination of final direct costs and indirect rates set forth in FAR 42.705, regardless of the dollar value or percentage of unsettled direct or indirect costs allocable to the contract, task order, or delivery order.
