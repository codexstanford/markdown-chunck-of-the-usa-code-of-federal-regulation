####### Time for submission of requests.

(c)(1) The time required by the Department of Labor for processing requests for project wage determinations varies according to the facts and circumstances in each case. An agency should expect the processing to take at least 30 days. Accordingly, agencies should submit requests for project wage determinations for the primary site of the work to the Department of Labor at least 45 days (60 days if possible) before issuing the solicitation or exercising an option to extend the term of a contract.

(2) Agencies should promptly submit to the Department of Labor an offeror's request for a project wage determination for a secondary site of the work.
