####### Contracting officer responsibilities.

(f)(1) The contracting officer, in consultation with the cognizant ACO, should consider including a repricing clause in noncompetitive fixed-price contracts that are negotiated during the period between-

(i) The time a business combination is announced; and

(ii) The time the contractor's forward pricing rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of restructuring.

(2) The decision to use a repricing clause will depend upon the particular circumstances involved, including-

(i) When the restructuring will take place;

(ii) When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;

(iii) The contract performance period;

(iv) Whether the contracting parties are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of restructuring on the contract; and

(v) The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the contract.

(3) If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, the clause must provide for a downward-only price adjustment to ensure that DoD receives its appropriate share of restructuring net savings.
