####### Risk charge.

(a)(1) Section 8711(d) of title 5, United States Code, provides for payment of a risk charge to FEGLI Program contractors as compensation for the risk assumed under the FEGLI Program. It is appropriate to pay such a charge when substantial risk is borne by the contractor; that is, when the balance in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund is no larger than five times annual claims.

(2) The risk charge is determined by agreement between the contractor and OPM. The amount of risk charge shall be specified in the contract.
