##### Subpart 217.73 - Identification of Sources of Supply
###### 217.7301 Policy.

Contractors shall identify their sources of supply in contracts for supplies. Contractor identification of sources of supply enables solicitation, in subsequent acquisitions, of actual manufacturers or other suppliers of items. This enhances competition and potentially avoids payment of additional costs for no significant added value.
