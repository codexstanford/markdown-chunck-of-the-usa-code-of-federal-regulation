###### Records and reporting.

(c)(1) The basis for each waiver and any plans to adapt similar requirements to metric specifications in future procurements should be documented in the contract file.

(2) Each procurement activity will maintain a log of the waivers from the metric requirements which are authorized for its procurements. The logs shall list the commodity/service being procured, total dollar value of the procured item(s), waiver date, authorizing official, basis for waiver, and USAID actions that can promote metrication and lessen the need for future waivers.

(3) Within 30 days of the closing of each fiscal year, each USAID/W procurement activity and each Mission will submit a copy of the metric waiver log for the year to the USAID Metric Executive. (Mission logs are to be consolidated in a Mission report for the procurement activity and for the nonprocurement activities maintaining such logs under the USAID Metric Transition Plan.) Repetitive purchases of commercially produced and marketed items and classes of items may be consolidated in reporting procurements that do not exceed $10,000 cumulatively during the reporting period.
