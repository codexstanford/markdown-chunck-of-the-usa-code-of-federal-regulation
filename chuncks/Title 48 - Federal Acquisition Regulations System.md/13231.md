(ii) Does the quality assurance plan provide for adequate monitoring of contractor performance?

(iii) Is the statement of work written so that it specifies a contract deliverable or requires progress reporting on contractor performance?

(iv) Is agency expertise adequate to independently evaluate the contractor's approach, methodology, results, options, conclusions or recommendations?

(v) Is the requirement for a function or service absent from the list in Appendix B of OFPP Policy Letter 92-1? If it is similar to a function or service on that list, greater management scrutiny may be required.
