(a)It is USAID policy that cooperating country nationals (CCNs) and third country nationals (TCNs), who are hired abroad for work in a cooperating country under USAID-direct contracts, generally be extended the same benefits, and be subject to the same restrictions as TCNs and CCNs employed by the USAID Mission. Exceptions to this policy may be granted either by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project. (TCN's and CCN's who are hired to work in the United States shall be extended benefits and subject to restrictions on the same basis as U.S. citizens who work in the United States.)
