####### Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR.

(2)(i) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR are-

(A) Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the agency as a whole;

(B) Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a suborganization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular suborganization; or

(C) Developed for use at a suborganizational level of an agency, not meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an individual acquisition and, thus, impractical to include in either an agency or suborganization acquisition regulation. (See 1.301(c).)

(ii) Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be in full text and the prescription for the use of each shall be included. Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be numbered in the same manner in which FAR provisions and clauses are numbered except that-

(A) If it is included in an agency acquisition regulation that is published in theand is codified in Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (48 CFR), the number shall be preceded by the chapter number within 48 CFR assigned by the CFR staff; and

(B) The sequential number shall be "70" or a higher number (see 1.303).

(iii) The sequential number at the end of the number of a provision or clause that supplements the FAR, like its counterpart at the end of any FAR provision or clause number, indicates the subsection location of the provision or clause in subpart 52.2 of the agency acquisition regulation that contains its full text. If, for example, an agency acquisition regulation contains only one provision followed by only one clause supplementing the FAR in its section 52.236 (Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts), then the sequential numbers would be "70" for the provision and "71" for the clause.
