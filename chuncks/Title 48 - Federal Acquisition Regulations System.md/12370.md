(2) A cyber incident that is reported by a contractor or subcontractor shall not, by itself, be interpreted as evidence that the contractor or subcontractor has failed to provide adequate security on their covered contractor information systems, or has otherwise failed to meet the requirements of the clause at 1252.239-74, Safeguarding DOT Sensitive Data and Cyber Incident Reporting. When a cyber incident is reported, the contracting officer shall consult with the DOT component Chief Information Officer/cyber security office prior to assessing contractor compliance (1239.7003). The contracting officer shall consider such cyber incidents in the context of an overall assessment of a contractor's compliance with the requirements of the clause at 1252.239-74, Safeguarding DOT Sensitive Data and Cyber Incident Reporting.
