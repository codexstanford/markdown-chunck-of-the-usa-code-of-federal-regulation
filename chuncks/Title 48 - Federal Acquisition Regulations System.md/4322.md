####### Secondary delegations of contract administration.

(e)(1) A CAO that has been delegated administration of a contract under paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, or a contracting office retaining contract administration, may request supporting contract administration from the CAO cognizant of the contractor location where performance of specific contract administration functions is required. The request shall-

(i) Be in writing;

(ii) Clearly state the specific functions to be performed; and

(iii) Be accompanied by a copy of pertinent contractual and other necessary documents.

(2) The prime contractor is responsible for managing its subcontracts. The CAO's review of subcontracts is normally limited to evaluating the prime contractor's management of the subcontracts (see Part 44). Therefore, supporting contract administration shall not be used for subcontracts unless-

(i) The Government otherwise would incur undue cost;

(ii) Successful completion of the prime contract is threatened; or

(iii) It is authorized under paragraph (f) of this section or elsewhere in this regulation.
