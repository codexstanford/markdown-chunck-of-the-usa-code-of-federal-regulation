Except as provided in 815.370-4, if only one offer is received when competitive procedures were used and the solicitation allowed fewer than 30 days for receipt of proposals, the contracting officer should-

(a) Consult with the requiring activity as to whether the requirements document should be revised in order to promote more competition (see FAR 6.502(b) and 11.002); and

(b) Consider re-soliciting, allowing an additional period of at least 30 days for receipt of proposals.
