(c)(1) Appeal files and supplements thereto may be filed on paper only by permission of the Board.

(2) Appeal file exhibits shall be complete, legible, arranged in chronological order, tabbed, and indexed. Parties shall avoid filing duplicative exhibits and shall number exhibits continuously and consecutively from one filing to the next, so a complete appeal file consists of one set of consecutively tabbed exhibits.

(3) Parties shall number the pages of each paper exhibit consecutively, unless an exhibit is already paginated in another logical manner.

(4) Parties shall file exhibits in 3-ring binders with spines no wider than 3 inches, labeled on the cover and spine with the name of the appeal, CBCA number, and tab numbers in each binder. Include in each binder the index of the entire filing.

(5) The appeal file index shall describe each exhibit by date and content.
