####### i.e.,

(c)(1) Exemptions from the withholding in the IRS regulations at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1(d)(1) through (4) are captured under the provision prescription at 29.402-3(a) (the contracting officer will not include the provision when one of the 29.402-3(a) exceptions applies).

(2) The exemptions at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1(d)(5) through (7) must be claimed by the offeror when it submits an IRS Form W-14 with the offer. If not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied to the contract.

(3) Any exemption claimed and self-certified on the IRS Form W-14 is subject to audit by the IRS. Any disputes regarding the imposition and collection of the section 5000C tax are adjudicated by the IRS as the section 5000C tax is a tax matter, not a contract issue.

(d) The exemptions in 29.201 through 29.302 do not apply to this section 5000C tax.
