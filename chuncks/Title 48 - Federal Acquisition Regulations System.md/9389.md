###### Commingled product.

(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a commingled product shall be considered to be a product of the United States if the offeror can establish that the offeror has in inventory at the time the contract for the commodity or product is awarded to the offeror, or obtains during the contract performance period specified in the solicitation, or a combination thereof, a sufficient quantity of the commodity or product that was produced in the United States to fulfill the contract being awarded, and all unfulfilled contracts that the offeror entered into to provide such commingled product to the United States.

(2) To the extent the Department has determined a commodity is one that is generally commingled, but is also one which can be readily stored on an identity preserved basis with respect to its country of origin, the Department may require that the commodity procured by the Department shall be of 100 percent United States origin.
