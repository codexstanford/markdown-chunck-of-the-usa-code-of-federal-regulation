###### 36.515 Schedules for construction contracts.

The contracting officer may insert the clause at 52.236-15, Schedules for Construction Contracts, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price construction contract is contemplated, the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, and the period of actual work performance exceeds 60 days. This clause may also be inserted in such solicitations and contracts when work performance is expected to last less than 60 days and an unusual situation exists that warrants imposition of the requirements. This clause should not be used in the same contract with clauses covering other management approaches for ensuring that a contractor makes adequate progress.
