(ii) In the case of a waiver granted in response to an emergency, the head of an agency granting the waiver must-

(A) Make a determination that the notice and consultation requirements are impracticable due to an emergency condition; and

(B) Within 30 days of award, notify the ODNI and the FASC of the waiver issued under emergency conditions in addition to the waiver notice to Congress under 4.2104(a)(4).
