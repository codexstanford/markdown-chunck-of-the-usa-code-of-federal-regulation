(a) In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as described in 225.7303-1 do not exist, except as provided in 225.7303-5, recognize the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a foreign government or international organization, even though such costs might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense contracts.

(i) Maintaining international sales and service organizations;

(iii) Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales to foreign governments. Section 126.8 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 126.8) may require Government approval for these costs to be allowable, in which case the appropriate Government approval shall be obtained; and

(iv) Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.

(2) Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as-

(i) Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, manuals, or other related data; and
