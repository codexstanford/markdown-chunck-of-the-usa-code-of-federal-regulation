(b)It is USAID policy that if an employee's base salary plus overseas recruitment incentive, if any (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 731.205-70) exceeds the USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST), as stated in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 302 USAID Direct Contracting (available at), it will be allowable only if approved in writing by the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall only provide such approval after internal Agency procedures for review/approval of salaries in excess of the USAID CST in ADS 302 have been followed. USAID policies on compensation of third country national or cooperating country national employees are set forth in (48 CFR) AIDAR 722.170.
