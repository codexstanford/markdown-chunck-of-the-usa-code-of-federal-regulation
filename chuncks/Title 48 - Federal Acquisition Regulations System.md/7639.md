(e)The clause at 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk, is intended to reduce acquisition costs by eliminating the costs of commercial insurance premiums. This clause also is intended to encourage the contractor to perform safe and effective operations through inclusion of a contractor's share of loss (a deductible). Additionally, the clause requires compliance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled "Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations" (Air Force Instruction 10-220, Army Regulation 95-20, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Instruction 3710.1 (Series), Coast Guard Instruction M13020.3 (Series), and Defense Contract Management Agency Instruction 8210-1 (Series)), which provides procedures to mitigate the risk of loss to the Government. For this reason, paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of the clause at 252.228-7001 specifies that insurance premium costs are unallowable. In addition, paragraph (d)(4) of the clause provides that the Government's assumption of risk does not apply where the loss or damage is covered by available insurance.
