####### e.g.,

(iii) Coverage in the TAR that supplements the FAR will use part, subpart, section, and subsection numbers ending in "70" through "89" (1201.301-70). A series of numbers beginning with "70" is used for provisions and clauses.

(iv) Coverage in the TAR, other than that identified with a "70" or higher number, that implements the FAR uses the identical number sequence and caption of the FAR segment being implemented, which may be to the paragraph level. Paragraph numbers and letters are not always shown sequentially, but may be shown by the specific FAR paragraph implemented. For example, TAR 1201.201-1 contains only paragraph (b) because only this paragraph, correlated with the FAR, is implemented in the TAR.
