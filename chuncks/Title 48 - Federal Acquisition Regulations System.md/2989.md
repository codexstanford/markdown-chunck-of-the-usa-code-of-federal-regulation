(2)This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Since the acquisition value is less than $50,000 and the acquisition is set aside, none of the trade agreements apply. Perform the steps in 25.502(a). Offer C is of 50 percent domestic content, therefore Offer C is evaluated as a foreign end product, because it is the product of a small business but is not a domestic end product (25.502(c)(4)). Since Offer B is a domestic offer, apply the 30 percent factor to Offer C (25.106(b)(2)). The resulting evaluated price of $13,130 remains lower than Offer B. The cost of Offer B is therefore unreasonable (25.106(b)(1)(ii)). The 25.106(b)(2) procedures do not apply. Award on Offer C at $10,100 (25.502(c)(4)(i)).
