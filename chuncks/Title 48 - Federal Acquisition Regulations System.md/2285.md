####### Reconsideration of a COC after issuance.

(c)(1) The SBA reserves the right to reconsider its issuance of a COC, prior to contract award, if-

(i) The COC applicant submitted false information or omitted materially adverse information; or

(ii) The COC has been issued for more than 60 days (in which case the SBA may investigate the firm's current circumstances).

(2) When the SBA reconsiders and reaffirms the COC, the procedures in subsection 19.602-2 do not apply.

(3) Denial of a COC by the SBA does not preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred concern, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other procurement.
