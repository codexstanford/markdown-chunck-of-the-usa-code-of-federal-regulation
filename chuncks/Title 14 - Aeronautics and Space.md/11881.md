##### Appendix A to Part 417 - Flight Safety Analysis Methodologies and Products for a Launch Vehicle Flown With a Flight Safety System
###### General.

(a)A flight safety analysis must include a straight-up time analysis that satisfies the requirements of ยง 417.215. This section applies to the computation of straight-up time as required by ยง 417.215 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by ยง 417.203(e). The analysis must establish a straight-up time as the latest time-after-liftoff, assuming a launch vehicle malfunctioned and flew in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point, at which activation of the launch vehicle's flight termination system or breakup of the launch vehicle would not cause hazardous debris or critical overpressure to affect any populated or other protected area.
