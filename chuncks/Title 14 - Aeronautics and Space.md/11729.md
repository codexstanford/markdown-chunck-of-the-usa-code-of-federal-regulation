###### ยง 417.303 Command control system requirements.
####### Command transmitter system.

(k)For each launch, a command transmitter system must:

(1) Transmit signals that are compatible with any command destruct system's radio frequency receiving system of section D417.25 and command receiver decoder of section D417.29 of appendix D of this part;

(2) Ensure that all arm and destruct commands transmitted to a flight termination system have priority over any other commands transmitted;

(3) Employ an authorized radio carrier frequency and bandwidth with a guard band that provides the radio frequency separation needed to ensure that the system does not interfere with any other flight safety system that is required to operate at the same time;

(4) Transmit an output bandwidth that is consistent with the signal spectrum power used in the link analysis of ยง 417.309(f); and

(5) Not transmit other frequencies that could degrade the airborne flight termination system's performance.
