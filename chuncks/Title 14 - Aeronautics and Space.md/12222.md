###### Charge-discharge cycles.

(n)This test only applies to a battery or cell that undergoes charging during normal operations. The test must satisfy all of the following:

(1) The test must subject the battery or cell sample to the maximum predicted number of charge-discharge cycles that the battery or cell will experience during normal operations;

(2) After activation, each battery or cell sample must undergo three thermal cycles at the end of the first cycle life and three thermal cycles at the end of each cycle life after each intermediate charge before the final charge;

(3) During each set of three thermal cycles for each charge-discharge cycle, the test must satisfy the thermal cycle test requirements of paragraphs (o)(2)-(o)(5) of this section;

(4) For a battery, after the three thermal cycles for each charge-discharge cycle, the battery must undergo a pin-to-case isolation test that satisfies paragraph (c)(4) of this section;

(5) Each battery or cell must undergo a discharge of its nameplate capacity before each charge; and

(6) The battery or cell must undergo any further operating environment tests only after the final charge.
