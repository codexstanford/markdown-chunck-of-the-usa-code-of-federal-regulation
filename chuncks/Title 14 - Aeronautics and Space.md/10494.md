###### Hearings.

(d)Public hearings will not normally be held for the purpose of implementing 42 U.S.C. 6362, particularly in connection with proposed actions which do not require notice and hearing as a prerequisite to decision under the Statute. Hearings may be ordered in exceptional circumstances where the proposed action is of great magnitude or widespread public interest and, in addition, presents complex issues peculiarly subject to resolution through evidentiary hearings and the process of cross-examination.
