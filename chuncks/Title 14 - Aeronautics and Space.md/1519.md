####### ยง 25.773 Pilot compartment view.
######## Nonprecipitation conditions.

(a)For nonprecipitation conditions, the following apply:

(1) Each pilot compartment must be arranged to give the pilots a sufficiently extensive, clear, and undistorted view, to enable them to safely perform any maneuvers within the operating limitations of the airplane, including taxiing takeoff, approach, and landing.

(2) Each pilot compartment must be free of glare and reflection that could interfere with the normal duties of the minimum flight crew (established under ยง 25.1523). This must be shown in day and night flight tests under nonprecipitation conditions.
