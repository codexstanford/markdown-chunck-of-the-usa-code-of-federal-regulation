######## Category A.

(a)For each category A rotorcraft, the Rotorcraft Flight Manual must contain a summary of the performance data, including data necessary for the application of any operating rule of this chapter, together with descriptions of the conditions, such as airspeeds, under which this data was determined, and must contain-

(1) The indicated airspeeds corresponding with those determined for takeoff, and the procedures to be followed if the critical engine fails during takeoff;

(2) The airspeed calibrations;

(3) The techniques, associated airspeeds, and rates of descent for autorotative landings;

(4) The rejected takeoff distance determined under § 29.62 and the takeoff distance determined under § 29.61;

(5) The landing data determined under § 29.81 and § 29.85;

(6) The steady gradient of climb for each weight, altitude, and temperature for which takeoff data are to be scheduled, along the takeoff path determined in the flight conditions required in § 29.67(a)(1) and (a)(2):

(i) In the flight conditions required in § 29.67(a)(1) between the end of the takeoff distance and the point at which the rotorcraft is 200 feet above the takeoff surface (or 200 feet above the lowest point of the takeoff profile for elevated heliports);

(ii) In the flight conditions required in § 29.67(a)(2) between the points at which the rotorcraft is 200 and 1000 feet above the takeoff surface (or 200 and 1000 feet above the lowest point of the takeoff profile for elevated heliports); and

(7) Out-of-ground effect hover performance determined under § 29.49 and the maximum weight for each altitude and temperature condition at which the rotorcraft can safely hover out-of-ground effect in winds of not less than 17 knots from all azimuths. These data must be clearly referenced to the appropriate hover charts.
