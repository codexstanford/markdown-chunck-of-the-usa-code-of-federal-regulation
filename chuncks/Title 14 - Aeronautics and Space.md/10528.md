#### PART 323 - TERMINATIONS, SUSPENSIONS, AND REDUCTIONS OF SERVICE
##### ยง 323.19 Withdrawal notice by exemption carriers in certain limited-entry markets.

As a condition on the exemption, an air carrier operating under exemption authority in an international market which is the subject of a carrier selection proceeding shall file a notice with the Department at least ninety days before it terminates service in that market. Once such a notice has been filed, the carrier may not terminate service in that market during the notice period unless the air carrier chosen in the selection proceeding enters the market and the Department grants the operating carrier permission to do so. The Department may allow earlier termination for good cause when in the public interest.
