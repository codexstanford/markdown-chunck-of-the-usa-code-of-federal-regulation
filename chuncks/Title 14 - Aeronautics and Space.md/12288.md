###### Circuit protection.

(h)A circuit protection test must demonstrate that any circuit protection allows a firing unit to satisfy all its performance specifications, when subjected to any improper launch processing, abnormal flight condition, or any failure of another launch vehicle component. The demonstration must include all of the following:

(1) Any circuit protection allows an exploding bridgewire firing unit to satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to the maximum input voltage of the open circuit voltage of the unit's power source and when subjected to the minimum input voltage of the loaded voltage of the power source;

(2) In the event of an input power dropout, any control or switching circuit that contributes to the reliable operation of an exploding bridgewire firing unit, including solid-state power transfer switches, does not change state for at least 50 milliseconds;

(3) Any watchdog circuit satisfies all its performance specifications;

(4) The firing unit satisfies all its performance specifications when any of its monitoring circuits' output ports are subjected to a short circuit or the highest positive or negative voltage capable of being supplied by the monitor batteries or other power supplies; and

(5) The firing unit satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to any reverse polarity voltage that could occur during launch processing.
