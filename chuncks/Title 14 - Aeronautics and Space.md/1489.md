####### ยง 25.729 Retracting mechanism.
######## General.

(a)For airplanes with retractable landing gear, the following apply:

(1) The landing gear retracting mechanism, wheel well doors, and supporting structure, must be designed for-

(i) The loads occurring in the flight conditions when the gear is in the retracted position,

(ii) The combination of friction loads, inertia loads, brake torque loads, air loads, and gyroscopic loads resulting from the wheels rotating at a peripheral speed equal to 1.23V(with the wing-flaps in take-off position at design take-off weight), occurring during retraction and extension at any airspeed up to 1.5 V(with the wing-flaps in the approach position at design landing weight), and

(iii) Any load factor up to those specified in ยง 25.345(a) for the wing-flaps extended condition.
