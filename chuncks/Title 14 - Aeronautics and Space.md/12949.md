###### ยง 450.137 Far-field overpressure blast effects analysis.
####### Application requirements.

(c)An applicant must submit a description of the far-field overpressure analysis, including all assumptions and justifications for the assumptions, analysis methods, input data, and results. At a minimum, the application must include:

(1) A description of the population centers, terrain, building types, and window characteristics used as input to the far-field overpressure analysis;

(2) A description of the methods used to compute the foreseeable explosive yield probability pairs, and the complete set of yield-probability pairs, used as input to the far-field overpressure analysis;

(3) A description of the methods used to compute peak incident overpressures as a function of distance from the explosion and prevailing meteorological conditions, including sample calculations for a representative range of the foreseeable meteorological conditions, yields, and population center locations;

(4) A description of the methods used to compute the probability of window breakage, including tabular data and graphs for the probability of breakage as a function of the peak incident overpressure for a representative range of window types, building types, and yields accounted for;

(5) A description of the methods used to compute the probability of casualty for a representative individual, including tabular data and graphs for the probability of casualty, as a function of location relative to the window and the peak incident overpressure for a representative range of window types, building types, and yields accounted for;

(6) Tabular data and graphs showing the hypothetical location of any member of the public that could be exposed to a probability of casualty of 1 x 10or greater for neighboring operations personnel, and 1 x 10or greater for other members of the public, given foreseeable conditions;

(7) The maximum expected casualties that could result from far-field overpressure hazards given foreseeable conditions; and

(8) A description of the meteorological measurements used as input to any real-time far-field overpressure analysis.
