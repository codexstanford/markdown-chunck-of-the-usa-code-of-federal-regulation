###### Decoder channel deviation.

(i)The test must demonstrate that the receiver decoder reliably processes the intended tone deviated signal at the minimum and maximum number of expected tones. The test must demonstrate that the receiver decoder satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to a nominal tone deviation plus twice the maximum and minus half the minimum of the total combined tolerances of all applicable radio frequency performance factors. The tone deviation must be no less than +/-3 KHz per tone.
