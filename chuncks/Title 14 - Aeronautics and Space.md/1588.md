####### ยง 25.832 Cabin ozone concentration.

(a) The airplane cabin ozone concentration during flight must be shown not to exceed-

(1) 0.25 parts per million by volume, sea level equivalent, at any time above flight level 320; and

(2) 0.1 parts per million by volume, sea level equivalent, time-weighted average during any 3-hour interval above flight level 270.

(b) For the purpose of this section, "sea level equivalent" refers to conditions of 25 &#xB0;C and 760 millimeters of mercury pressure.

(c) Compliance with this section must be shown by analysis or tests based on airplane operational procedures and performance limitations, that demonstrate that either-

(1) The airplane cannot be operated at an altitude which would result in cabin ozone concentrations exceeding the limits prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section; or

(2) The airplane ventilation system, including any ozone control equipment, will maintain cabin ozone concentrations at or below the limits prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section.
