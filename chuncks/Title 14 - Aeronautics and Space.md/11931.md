###### Land impact dispersion ellipses.

(f)A land impact hazard area must contain the land impact dispersion ellipse for each planned land impact. A launch operator must compute a land impact dispersion ellipse in the vicinity of each planned land impact location as follows:

(1) The analysis must calculate a one-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the one-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.

(2) Taking the one-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10nm longer than the major and minor axes of the one-sigma dispersion ellipse.
