###### Tensile load.

(j)A tensile load test must demonstrate that a component satisfies all its performance specifications after being exposed to tensile and compression loads of no less than twice the maximum predicted level during transportation and installation. In addition, the test load must satisfy one of the following where applicable:

(1) For an explosive transfer system and its associated fittings, a pull of no less than 100 pounds unless the launch operator establishes procedural controls or tests that prevent or detect mishandling;

(2) For a destruct charge and its associated fittings, a pull of no less than 50 pounds;

(3) For a flight radio frequency connector, a pull of no less than one-half the manufacturer specified limit;

(4) For an electro-explosive device wire, a pull of no less than 18 pounds; or

(5) For an electrical pin of an exploding bridgewire device, no less than an 18-pound force in axial and compression modes.
