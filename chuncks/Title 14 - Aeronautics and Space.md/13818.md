#### ยง 1250.104 Assurances.
##### Instrument effecting or recording transfers of real property.

(e)The instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by NASA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible NASA official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee.
