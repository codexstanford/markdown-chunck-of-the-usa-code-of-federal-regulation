###### Qualification thermal cycle.

(p)A qualification thermal cycle test must demonstrate that a nickel-cadmium battery satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to pre-flight, acceptance test, and flight thermal cycle environments. This must include each of the following:

(1) The test must subject the fully charged battery to no less than three times the acceptance-number of thermal cycles of paragraph (o)(1) of this section.

(2) The qualification thermal cycle high temperature must be a 40 &#xB0;C workmanship screening level or the maximum predicted environment high temperature plus 10 &#xB0;C, whichever is higher. The qualification thermal cycle low temperature must be a -34 &#xB0;C workmanship screening temperature or the predicted environment low temperature minus 10 &#xB0;C, whichever is lower.

(3) When heating or cooling the battery during each cycle, the temperature must change at an average rate of 1 &#xB0;C per minute or the maximum predicted rate, whichever is greater. The dwell time at each high and low temperature must be long enough for the battery to achieve internal thermal equilibrium and must be no less than one hour.

(4) The test must measure the battery's critical status-of-health parameters at the thermal extremes on all cycles and during thermal transition to demonstrate that the battery satisfies all its performance specifications. The battery must undergo monitoring of its open circuit voltage throughout the test to demonstrate that it satisfies all it performance specifications. The sample rate must be once every 10 seconds or more often.

(5) The battery must undergo an electrical performance test that satisfies paragraph (n) of this section while the battery is at the high, ambient, and low temperatures, during the first, middle, and last thermal cycles.

(6) If either the workmanship high or low temperature exceeds the battery's maximum predicted operating temperature range and the battery is not capable of passing the electrical performance test at the workmanship temperature, the battery may undergo the discharge and pulse capacity test at an interim temperature during the cycle. This must include all of the following:

(i) Any interim high temperature must be no less than the maximum predicted high temperature plus 10 &#xB0;C;

(ii) Any interim low temperature must be no greater than the maximum predicted low temperature minus 10 &#xB0;C;

(iii) The dwell-time at any interim temperature must last long enough for the battery to reach thermal equilibrium; and

(iv) After any electrical performance test at an interim temperature, the thermal cycle must continue to the workmanship temperature.
