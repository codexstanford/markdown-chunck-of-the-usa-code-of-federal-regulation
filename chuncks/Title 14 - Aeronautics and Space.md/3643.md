###### Noise unit definition.

(b)(1) The value of sound exposure level (SEL, or as denoted by symbol, L), is defined as the level, in decibels, of the time integral of squared 'A'-weighted sound pressure (P) over a given time period or event, with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure (P) of 20 micropascals and a reference duration of one second.

(2) This unit is defined by the expression:

(3) The integral equation of paragraph (b)(2) of this section can also be expressed as:

(4) The integration time (t-t) in practice shall not be less than the time interval during which L(t) first rises to within 10 dB(A) of its maximum value (L) and last falls below 10 dB(A) of its maximum value.

(5) The SEL may be approximated by the following expression:
