20.The Sponsor agrees that it will operate the Airport for the use and benefit of the public, on fair and reasonable terms, and without unjust discrimination. In furtherance of the covenant (but without limiting its general applicability and effect), the Sponsor specifically covenants and agrees:

a. That in its operation and the operation of all facilities on the Airport, neither it nor any person or organization occupying space or facilities thereon will discriminate against any person or class of persons by reason of race, color, creed, or national origin in the use of any of the facilities provided for the public on the Airport.

b. That in any agreement, contract, lease or other arrangement under which a right or privilege at the Airport is granted to any person, firm, or corporation to conduct or engage in any aeronautical activity for furnishing services to the public at the Airport, the Sponsor will insert and enforce provisions requiring the contractor-

(1) To furnish said service on a fair, equal, and not unjustly discriminatory basis to all users thereof, and

(2) To charge fair, reasonable, and not unjustly discriminatory prices for each unit or service; Provided, That the contractor may be allowed to make reasonable and nondiscriminatory discounts, rebates, or other similar types of price reductions to volume purchasers.

c. That it will not exercise or grant any right or privilege which would operate to prevent any person, firm or corporation operating aircraft on the Airport from performing any services on its own aircraft with its own employees (including, but not limited to maintenance and repair) that it may choose to perform.

d. In the event the Sponsor itself exercises any of the rights and privileges referred to in subsection b, the services involved will be provided on the same conditions as would apply to the furnishing of such services by contractors or concessionaires of the Sponsor under the provisions of such subsection b.
