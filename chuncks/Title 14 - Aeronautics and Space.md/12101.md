###### Status-of-health tests.

(f)Each status-of-health test required by any table of this appendix must satisfy all of the following:

(1) Each test must measure one or more critical performance parameter to demonstrate that a component or system satisfies all its performance specifications;

(2) The critical performance parameters must include those parameters that act as an indicator of an internal anomaly that a functional performance test might not detect; and

(3) Each test must compare the results to any previous test results to identify any degradation in performance.
