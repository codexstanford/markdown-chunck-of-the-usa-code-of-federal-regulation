###### Status-of-health.

(c)A status-of-health test of a shock or vibration isolator must satisfy section E417.3(f). The test must include all of the following:

(1) The test must measure the isolator's natural frequency while the isolator is subjected to a random vibration or sinusoidal sweep vibration with amplitudes that are representative of the maximum predicted operating environment; and

(2) The test must measure the isolator's dynamic amplification value while the isolator is subjected to a random vibration or sinusoidal sweep vibration with amplitudes that are representative of the maximum predicted operating environment.
