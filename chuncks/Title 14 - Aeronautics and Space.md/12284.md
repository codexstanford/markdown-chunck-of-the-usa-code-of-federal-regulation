###### High voltage circuitry.

(d)This test must demonstrate that a firing unit's high voltage circuitry satisfies all its performance specifications for initiating the exploding bridgewire when subjected to any variation in input that the circuitry could experience during flight. The firing unit must undergo the test before the first and after the last environmental test to identify any degradation in performance due to any of the test environments. The test must demonstrate all of the following:

(1) The firing unit satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to the worst-case high and low arm voltages that it could experience during flight;

(2) The firing unit's charging and output circuitry has an output waveform, rise-time, and amplitude that delivers no less than a 50% voltage margin to the exploding bridgewire. The test must use the identical parameters, such as capacitor values and circuit and load impedance, as those used to provide the exploding bridgewire all-fire energy level;

(3) The firing unit does not experience any arcing or corona during high voltage discharge; and

(4) Each high-energy trigger circuit used to initiate the main firing capacitor has an output signal that delivers no less than a 50% voltage margin with an input to the circuit at the nominal trigger threshold level.
