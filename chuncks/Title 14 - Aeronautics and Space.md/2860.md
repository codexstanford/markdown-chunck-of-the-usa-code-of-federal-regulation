####### ยง 29.755 Hull buoyancy.
######## Water-based and amphibian rotorcraft.

The hull and auxiliary floats, if used, must have enough watertight compartments so that, with any single compartment of the hull or auxiliary floats flooded, the buoyancy of the hull and auxiliary floats, and wheel tires if used, provides a margin of positive water stability great enough to minimize the probability of capsizing the rotorcraft for the worst combination of wave heights and surface winds for which approval is desired.
