####### Maximum payload capacity

(h)means the maximum certificated takeoff weight of an aircraft less the empty weight as defined in section 03 of part 241 of this chapter, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum fuel load, oil, flight crew, steward's supplies, etc.). For purposes of this part, the allowance for weight of the crew, oil and fuel is as follows:

(1) Crew-200 pounds per crew member required under FAA regulations in 14 CFR chapter I, (2) oil-350 pounds, (3) fuel-the minimum weight of fuel required under FAA regulations in 14 CFR chapter I for a flight between domestic points 200 miles apart, assuming VFR weather conditions and flights not involving extended overwater operations. However, in the case of aircraft for which a maximum zero fuel weight is prescribed by the FAA, maximum payload capacity means the maximum zero fuel weight less the empty weight, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum flight crew, steward's supplies, etc., but not including disposable fuel or oil).

(2) [Reserved]
