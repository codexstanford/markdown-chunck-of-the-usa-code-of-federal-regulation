###### Input current monitor.

(g)An input current monitor test must continuously monitor command receiver decoder power input current during environmental stress conditions to detect any variation in amplitude. Any variation in input current indicates internal component damage and constitutes a test failure. Any fluctuation in nominal current draw when the command receiver decoder is in the steady state indicates internal component damage and constitutes a test failure.
