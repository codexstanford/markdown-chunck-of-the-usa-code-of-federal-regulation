###### No-fire energy level.

(m)This test must consist of a statistical firing series of electro-explosive device lot samples to determine the no-fire energy level for the remainder of the lot. The firing series must determine the highest electrical energy level at which the device will not fire with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level when subjected to a continuous current pulse. Any demonstrated no-fire energy level that is less than the no-fire energy level used in the flight termination system design and analysis constitutes a test failure.
