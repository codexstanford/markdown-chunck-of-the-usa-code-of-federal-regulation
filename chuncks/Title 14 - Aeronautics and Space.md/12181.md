###### Voltage standing wave ratio.

(viii)The test must demonstrate that any radio frequency losses within the receiver decoder interface to the antenna system satisfy the required 12 dB margin. The test must determine the radio frequency voltage standing wave ratio at the high, low, and assigned operating frequencies of the operating bandwidth and demonstrate that it satisfies its performance specifications and is in-family. The test must also demonstrate that the impedance of the radio frequency receiving system and the impedance of the receiver decoder are matched closely enough to ensure that the receiver decoder satisfies all its performance specifications.
