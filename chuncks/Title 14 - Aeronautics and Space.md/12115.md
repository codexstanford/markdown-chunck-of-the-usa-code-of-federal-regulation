###### Transportation vibration.

(f)A transportation vibration test or analysis must demonstrate that a component satisfies all its performance specifications after being subjected to a maximum predicted transportation-induced vibration level when transported in its transportation configuration as follows:

(1) Any transportation vibration test must subject a component to vibration in three mutually perpendicular axes for 60 minutes per axis. The test must subject each axis to the following vibration profile:

(i) 0.01500 g/Hz at 10 Hz to 40 Hz;

(ii) 0.01500 g/Hz at 40 Hz to 0.00015 g/Hz at 500 Hz; and

(iii) If the component is resonant below 10 Hz, the test vibration profile must extend to the lowest resonant frequency.

(2) Any analysis must demonstrate that the qualification operating vibration environment is more severe than the transportation vibration environment. The analysis must include vibration fatigue equivalence calculations that demonstrate that the high vibration levels with short duration experienced during flight creates a more severe environment than the relatively low-vibration levels with long duration that would be experienced during transportation.
