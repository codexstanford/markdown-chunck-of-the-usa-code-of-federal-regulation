###### Operating Limitations
####### ยง 25.1516 Other speed limitations.
############### ยง 25.1517 Rough air speed, V

(a) A rough air speed, Vfor use as the recommended turbulence penetration airspeed, and a rough air Mach number, M, for use as the recommended turbulence penetration Mach number, must be established. V/Mmust be sufficiently less than V/Mto ensure that likely speed variation during rough air encounters will not cause the overspeed warning to operate too frequently.

(b) At altitudes where Vis not limited by Mach number, in the absence of a rational investigation substantiating the use of other values, Vmust be less than Vminus 35 KTAS.

(c) At altitudes where Vis limited by Mach number, Mmay be chosen to provide an optimum margin between low and high speed buffet boundaries.
