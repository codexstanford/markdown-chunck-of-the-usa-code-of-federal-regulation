### PART 1206 - PROCEDURES FOR DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA)
#### Subpart D - Procedures and Time Limits for Responding to Requests
##### ยง 1206.401 Procedures and time limits for acknowledgement letters and initial determinations.

(a) Following receipt of a request submitted under the FOIA, the FOIA staff will send an acknowledgement letter providing the case tracking number and processing track within ten (10) working days from date of receipt to the requester.

(b) An initial determination is a decision by a NASA official, in response to a request by a member of the public for an Agency record, on whether the record described in the request can be identified and located after a reasonable search and, if so, whether the record (or portions thereof) will be made available under this part or will be withheld from disclosure under the FOIA.

(c) An initial determination on a request for an Agency record addressed in accordance with this regulation (to include one submitted in person at a FOIA office) shall be made (for example, to grant, partially grant or deny a request), and the requester shall be sent an initial determination letter within 20 working days after receipt of the request, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) (unless unusual circumstances exist as defined in ยง 1206.403).

(d) The basic time limit for a misdirected FOIA request (not a referral or consultation) begins on the date on which the request is first received by the appropriate FOIA office within the Agency, but in any event no later than ten (10) working days after the date the request is first received by a FOIA office designated to receive FOIA requests.

(e) Any notification of an initial determination that does not comply fully with the request for an Agency record, including those searches that produce no responsive documents, shall include a statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, include the name and title of the person making the initial determination, and notify the requester of the right to appeal to the Administrator or the Inspector General, as appropriate, pursuant to subpart G of this part, and the right to seek dispute resolution services from the NASA FOIA Public Liaison or Office of Government Information Services.
