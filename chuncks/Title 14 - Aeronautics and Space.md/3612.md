###### Approach profiles.

(d)(1) Figure H3 illustrates a typical approach profile, including reference conditions.

(2) The helicopter approaches position H along a 6&#xB0; (+/-0.5&#xB0;) average approach slope throughout the 10dB-down time interval. Deviation from the 6&#xB0; average approach slope must be approved by the FAA before testing.

(3) Figure H3 illustrates portions of the measured and reference approach flight paths including the significant geometrical relationships influencing sound propagation. The measured approach path is represented by segment EK with an approach allowable angle &#x3B8;. Reference positions, Eand K, define an idealized reference approach angle of 6&#xB0;. Position N represents the helicopter location on the measured approach flight path for which PNLTM is observed at measuring station A, and Nis the corresponding position on the reference approach flight path. The measured and reference noise propagation paths are AN and AN, respectively, both of which form the same angle, &#x3B8;, corresponding to PNLTM relative to their approach flight paths.
