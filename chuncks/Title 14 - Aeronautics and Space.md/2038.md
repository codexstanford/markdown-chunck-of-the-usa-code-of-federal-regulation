###### Report.

(h)The test report must include the following for each specimen tested:

(1) Description of the specimen.

(2) Radiant heat flux to the specimen, expressed in W/cm.

(3) Data giving release rates of heat (in kW/m) as a function of time, either graphically or tabulated at intervals no greater than 10 seconds. The calibration factor (k) must be recorded.

(4) If melting, sagging, delaminating, or other behavior that affects the exposed surface area or the mode of burning occurs, these behaviors must be reported, together with the time at which such behaviors were observed.

(5) The peak heat release and the 2-minute integrated heat release rate must be reported.
