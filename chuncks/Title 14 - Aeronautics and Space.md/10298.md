####### Appeals to the DOT decisionmaker from rulings of administrative law judges.

(h)Rulings of administrative law judges on motions may not be appealed to the DOT decisionmaker prior to his or her consideration of the entire proceeding except in extraordinary circumstances and with the consent of the administrative law judge. An appeal shall be disallowed unless the administrative law judge finds, either on the record or in writing, that the allowance of such an appeal is necessary to prevent substantial detriment to the public interest or undue prejudice to any party. If an appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the DOT decisionmaker within such period as the administrative law judge directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise. The rulings of the administrative law judge on a motion may be reviewed by the DOT decisionmaker in connection with his or her final action in the proceeding or at any other appropriate time irrespective of the filing of an appeal or any action taken on it.
