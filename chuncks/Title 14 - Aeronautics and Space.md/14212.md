### PART 1261 - PROCESSING OF MONETARY CLAIMS (GENERAL)
#### Subpart 1261.4 - Collection of Civil Claims of the United States Arising Out of the Activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
##### § 1261.414 Compromise of claims.

(a) Designated NASA officials (see §§ 1261.402 and 1261.403) may compromise claims for money or property arising out of the activities of the Agency where the claim, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000, prior to the referral of such claims to the Government Accountability Office, or to the Department of Justice for litigation. The Comptroller General may exercise such compromise authority with respect to claims referred to the Government Accountability Office prior to their further referral for litigation. Only the Comptroller General may effect the compromise of a claim that arises out of an exception made by the Government Accountability Office in the account of an accountable officer, including a claim against the payee, prior to its referral by the Government Accountability Office for litigation.

(b) When the claim, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000, the authority to accept the compromise rests solely with the Department of Justice. NASA should evaluate the offer, using the factors set forth in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, and may recommend compromise for reasons under one, or more than one, of those paragraphs. If NASA then wishes to accept the compromise, it must refer the matter to the Department of Justice, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report. See § 1261.417(e) or 31 CFR 904.2(c). Claims for which the gross amount is over $200,000 shall be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Claims for which the gross original amount is $200,000 or less shall be referred to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. The referral should specify the reasons for the Agency's recommendation. If NASA has a debtor's firm written offer of compromise which is substantial in amount and the Agency is uncertain as to whether the offer should be accepted, it may refer the offer, the supporting data, and particulars concerning the claim to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice. The Government Accountability Office or the Department of Justice may act upon such an offer or return it to the agency with instructions or advice. If NASA wishes to reject the compromise, Government Accountability Office or Department of Justice approval is not required.

(c) A claim may be compromised pursuant to this section if NASA cannot collect the full amount because of the debtor's inability to pay the full amount within a reasonable time, or the refusal of the debtor to pay the claim in full and the Government's inability to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings. In determining the debtor's inability or refusal to pay, the following factors, among others, may be considered:

(1) Age and health of the debtor;

(2) Present and potential income;

(3) Inheritance prospects;

(4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor;

(5) The availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings; and

(6) The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. Uncertainty as to the price which collateral or other property will bring at forced sale may properly be considered in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. The compromise should be for an amount which bears a reasonable relation to the amount which can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, having regard for the exemptions available to the debtor and the time which collection will take.

(d) A claim may be compromised if there is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases should fairly reflect the probability of prevailing on the legal question involved, the probabilities with respect to full or partial recovery of a judgment, paying due regard to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government claim, and related pragmatic considerations. In determining the litigative risks involved, proportionate weight should be given to the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act which may be assessed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation. See 28 U.S.C. 2412.

(e) A claim may be compromised if the cost of collecting the claim does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, paying heed to the time which it will take to effect collection. Costs of collecting may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small claims, but normally will not carry great weight in the settlement of large claims. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced collection of the full amount, it is legitimate to consider the positive effect that enforced collection of some claims may have on the collection of other claims. Since debtors are more likely to pay when first requested to do so if an agency has a policy of vigorous collection of all claims, the fact that the cost of collection of any one claim may exceed the amount of the claim does not necessarily mean that the claim should be compromised. The practical benefits of vigorous collection of a small claim may include a demonstration to other debtors that resistance to payment is not likely to succeed.
