###### Water Loads
####### ยง 25.529 Hull and main float landing conditions.
######## Symmetrical step, bow, and stern landing.

(a)For symmetrical step, bow, and stern landings, the limit water reaction load factors are those computed under ยง 25.527. In addition-

(1) For symmetrical step landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, through the center of gravity, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line;

(2) For symmetrical bow landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, one-fifth of the longitudinal distance from the bow to the step, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line; and

(3) For symmetrical stern landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, at a point 85 percent of the longitudinal distance from the step to the stern post, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line.
