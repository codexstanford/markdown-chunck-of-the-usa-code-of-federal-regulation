###### Flight Maneuver and Gust Conditions
####### ยง 25.345 High lift devices.
######## V

(1) Propeller slipstream corresponding to maximum continuous power at the design flap speedsand with takeoff power at not less than 1.4 times the stalling speed for the particular flap position and associated maximum weight; and

(2) A head-on gust of 25 feet per second velocity (EAS).

(c) If flaps or other high lift devices are to be used in en route conditions, and with flaps in the appropriate position at speeds up to the flap design speed chosen for these conditions, the airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers and gusts within the range determined by-

(1) Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor as prescribed in ยง 25.337(b); and

(2) The vertical gust and turbulence conditions prescribed in ยง 25.341(a) and (b).

(d) The airplane must be designed for a maneuvering load factor of 1.5 g at the maximum take-off weight with the wing-flaps and similar high lift devices in the landing configurations.
