###### Horizontal test.

(5)A minimum of three specimens must be tested and the results averaged. Each specimen must be supported horizontally. The exposed surface, when installed in the aircraft, must be face down for the test. The specimen must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal-inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of 1inches in height. The minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer in the center of the flame must be 1550 &#xB0;F. The specimen must be positioned so that the edge being tested is centered-inch above the top of the burner. The flame must be applied for 15 seconds and then removed. A minimum of 10 inches of specimen must be used for timing purposes, approximately 1inches must burn before the burning front reaches the timing zone, and the average burn rate must be recorded.
