###### ยง 417.309 Flight safety system analysis.
####### System reliability.

(b)Each flight termination system and command control system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates the system's predicted reliability. Each analysis must:

(1) Account for the probability of a flight safety system anomaly occurring and all of its effects as determined by the single failure point analysis and the sneak circuit analysis required by paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section;

(2) Demonstrate that each system satisfies the predicted reliability requirement of 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level;

(3) Use a reliability model that is statistically valid and accurately represents the system;

(4) Account for the actual or predicted reliability of all subsystems and components;

(5) Account for the effects of storage, transportation, handling, maintenance, and operating environments on component predicted reliability; and

(6) Account for the interface between the launch vehicle systems and the flight termination system.
