###### § 298.61 Reporting of traffic statistics.

(a) Each commuter air carrier and small certificated air carrier shall file Schedule T-100, U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market."

(b) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly as set forth in§ 298.60.

(1) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data from revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. The first grouping, the nonstop segment information, is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.
