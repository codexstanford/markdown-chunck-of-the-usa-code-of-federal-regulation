###### Passive components.

(3)For any passive component that does not contain any active electronic piece-part, such as any radio frequency antenna, coupler, or cable, an acceptance thermal cycle test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) Unless otherwise noted, the acceptance thermal cycle environment must range from the higher of the maximum predicted environment high temperature or a 61 &#xB0;C workmanship screening temperature, to the lower of the predicted lowest temperature or a -24 &#xB0;C workmanship screening temperature;

(ii) The test must subject a component to no fewer than the acceptance-number of thermal cycles. For each component, the acceptance-number of thermal cycles must satisfy this paragraph. For each cycle, the dwell-time at each high and low temperature must last long enough for the component to achieve internal thermal equilibrium and must last no less than one hour;

(iii) When heating or cooling the component, the temperature must change at an average rate of 1 &#xB0;C per minute or the maximum predicted rate, whichever is greater;

(iv) The test must measure all performance parameters when the component is at ambient temperature before beginning the first thermal cycle and after completing the last cycle;

(v) The test must measure all performance parameters when the component is at the high and low temperatures during the first, middle, and last thermal cycles; and

(vi) The test must continuously monitor and record all critical performance and status-of-health parameters throughout each thermal cycle with a resolution and sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation.
