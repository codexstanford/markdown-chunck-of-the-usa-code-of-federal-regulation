A Limited Area shall also have a clearly defined perimeter, but differs from a Controlled Area in that permanent physical barriers and access control devices, including walls and doors with locks or access devices, are emplaced to assist the occupants in keeping out unauthorized personnel. All facilities designated as NASA Critical Infrastructure or a key resource will be designated at a minimum as "Limited" areas.
