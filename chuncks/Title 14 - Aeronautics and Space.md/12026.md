###### Circuit protection.

(g)Any circuit protection provided within a flight termination system must satisfy all of the following:

(1) Electronic circuitry must not contain protection devices, such as fuses, except as allowed by paragraph (g)(2) of this section. A destruct circuit may employ current limiting resistors;

(2) Any electronic circuit designed to shut down or disable a launch vehicle engine and that interfaces with a launch vehicle function must use one or more devices, such as fuses, circuit breakers, or limiting resistors, to protect against over-current, including any direct short; and

(3) The design of a flight termination system output circuit that interfaces with another launch vehicle circuit must prevent any launch vehicle circuit failure from disabling or degrading the flight termination system's performance.
