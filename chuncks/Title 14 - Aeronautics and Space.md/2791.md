####### § 29.549 Fuselage and rotor pylon structures.

(a) Each fuselage and rotor pylon structure must be designed to withstand-

(1) The critical loads prescribed in §§ 29.337 through 29.341, and 29.351;

(2) The applicable ground loads prescribed in §§ 29.235, 29.471 through 29.485, 29.493, 29.497, 29.505, and 29.521; and

(3) The loads prescribed in § 29.547 (d)(1) and (e)(1)(i).

(b) Auxiliary rotor thrust, the torque reaction of each rotor drive system, and the balancing air and inertia loads occurring under accelerated flight conditions, must be considered.

(c) Each engine mount and adjacent fuselage structure must be designed to withstand the loads occurring under accelerated flight and landing conditions, including engine torque.

(d) [Reserved]

(e) If approval for the use of 2-minute OEI power is requested, each engine mount and adjacent structure must be designed to withstand the loads resulting from a limit torque equal to 1.25 times the mean torque for 2-minute OEI power combined with 1g flight loads.
