####### Other alcohol-related conduct.

(f)(1) No covered employee tested under this subpart who is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 shall perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions for an employer, nor shall an employer permit the employee to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions, until:

(i) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or

(ii) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 8 hours following administration of the test.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, no employer shall take any action under this rule against an employee based solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04.
