####### Application requirements.

(f)An applicant must submit:

(1) The identity of the toxic propellant, chemical, or combustion products or derivatives in the possible toxic release;

(2) The applicant's selected airborne toxic concentration and duration thresholds;

(3) The meteorological conditions for the atmospheric transport and buoyant cloud rise of any toxic release from its source to downwind receptor locations;

(4) Characterization of the terrain, as input for modeling the atmospheric transport of a toxic release from its source to downwind receptor locations;

(5) The identity of the toxic dispersion model used, and any other input data;

(6) Representative results of an applicant's toxic dispersion modeling to predict concentrations and durations at selected downwind receptor locations, to determine the toxic hazard area for a released quantity of the toxic substance;

(7) For toxic release hazard analysis in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section:

(i) A description of the failure modes and associated relative probabilities for potential toxic release scenarios used in the risk evaluation; and

(ii) The methodology and representative results of an applicant's determination of the worst-case or maximum-credible quantity of any toxic release that might occur during ground operations;

(8) For toxic containment in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, identify the evacuation plans or meteorological constraints and associated ground hazard controls needed to ensure that the public will not be within any toxic hazard area in the event of a worst-case release or maximum credible release scenario.

(9) For toxic risk assessment in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section:

(i) A demonstration that the risk criteria in ยง 450.185(c) will be met;

(ii) The population characteristics in receptor locations that are identified by toxic dispersion modeling as toxic hazard areas;

(iii) A description of any risk mitigation measures applied in the toxic risk assessment; and

(iv) A description of the population exposure input data used in accordance with ยง 450.123.
