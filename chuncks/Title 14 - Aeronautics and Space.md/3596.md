###### Approach reference profile.

(f)(1) Figure H3 illustrates approach profile, including reference conditions.

(i) The beginning of the approach profile is represented by helicopter position E. The position of the helicopter is recorded for a sufficient distance (EK) to ensure recording of the entire interval during which the measured helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of Maximum Tone Corrected Perceived Noise Level (PNLTM). The reference flight path, EKrepresents a stable flight condition in terms of torque, rpm, indicated airspeed, and rate of descent resulting in a 6&#xB0; approach angle.

(ii) The test approach profile is defined by the approach angle &#x3B7; passing directly over the station A at a height of AH, to position K, which terminates the approach noise certification profile. The test approach angle &#x3B7; must be between 5.5&#xB0; and 6.5&#xB0;.

(2) The helicopter approaches position H along a constant 6&#xB0; approach slope throughout the 10 dB down time period. The helicopter crosses position E and proceeds along the approach slope crossing over station A until it reaches position K.
