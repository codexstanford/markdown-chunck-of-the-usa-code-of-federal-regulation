###### General.

(a)A flight termination system, its subsystems, and components must undergo the pre-flight tests required by this section to demonstrate that the system will satisfy all its performance specifications during the countdown and launch vehicle flight. After successful completion of any pre-flight test, if the integrity of the system, subsystem, or component is compromised due to a configuration change or other event, such as a lightning strike or connector de-mate, the system, subsystem, or component must repeat the pre-flight test.
