######## Braked roll conditions in the level landing attitude.

(g)In the attitudes specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and with the shock absorbers in their static positions, the rotorcraft must be designed for braked roll loads as follows:

(1) The limit vertical load must be based on a limit vertical load factor of not less than-

(i) 1.0, for the attitude specified in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(ii) 1.33, for the attitude specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) For each wheel with brakes, a drag load must be applied, at the ground contact point, of not less than the lesser of-

(i) 0.8 times the vertical load; and

(ii) The maximum based on limiting brake torque.
