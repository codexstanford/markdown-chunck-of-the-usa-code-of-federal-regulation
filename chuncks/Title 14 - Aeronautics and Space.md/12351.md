###### Status-of-health.

(b)A status-of-health test of a harness or connector must satisfy section E417.3(f). The test must include all of the following:

(1) The test must measure the dielectric withstanding voltage between mutually insulated portions of the harness or connector to demonstrate that the harness or connector satisfies all its performance specifications at its rated voltage and withstands any momentary over-potential due to switching, surge, or any other similar phenomena;

(2) The test must demonstrate that the insulation resistance between mutually insulated points is sufficient to ensure that the harness or connector satisfies all its performance specifications at its rated voltage and the insulation material is not damaged after the harness or connector is subjected to the qualification environments;

(3) The test must demonstrate the ability of the insulation resistance between each wire shield and harness or conductor and the insulation between each harness or connector pin to every other pin to withstand a minimum workmanship voltage of 500 VDC or 150% of the rated output voltage, whichever is greater; and

(4) The test must measure the resistance of any wire and harness insulation to demonstrate that it satisfies all its performance specifications.
