###### Deflagration and pressure sensitive ordnance transfer systems.

(d)A qualification test of a deflagration or pressure sensitive ordnance transfer system composed of devices such as ordnance delays, electro-explosive system low energy end-tips, and percussion-activated device primers must demonstrate the system's reliability using one of the following:

(1) A statistical firing series that varies critical performance parameters, including gap interface, to ensure that ordnance initiation occurs across each flight configured interface;

(2) Firing 2994 flight units in a flight representative configuration to demonstrate that ordnance initiation occurs across each flight configured interface; or

(3) Firing all of the following units to demonstrate a significant gap margin:

(i) Five units using a 75% downloaded donor charge across the maximum gap; and

(ii) Five units using a 120% overloaded donor charge across the minimum gap.
