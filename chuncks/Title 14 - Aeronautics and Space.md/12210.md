###### Pin-to-case isolation.

(4)A pin-to-case isolation test must satisfy the status-of-health test requirements of section E417.3(f). The test must measure voltage isolation between each pin and the battery case to demonstrate that no current leakage path exists as a result of electrolyte leakage. This measurement must use a voltmeter with an internal resistance of no less than 100K ohms and have a resolution that detects any leakage current of 0.1 milliamps or greater.
