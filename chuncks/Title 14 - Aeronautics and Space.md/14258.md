##### ยง 1261.603 Procedures for salary offset.

If NASA determines that a Federal employee is indebted to the United States or is notified of such by the head of another agency (or delegee), the amount of indebtedness may be collected in monthly installments, or regularly established pay intervals, by deduction from the affected employee's pay account. The deductions may be made from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, from other authorized pay. The requirements in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section must be met before a deduction is made from the current pay account of an employee.
