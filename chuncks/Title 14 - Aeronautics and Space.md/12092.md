###### Test tolerances.

(f)Each test must apply to the nominal values specified by this appendix tolerances that satisfy the following:

(1) The tolerance of any measurement taken during a functional test must provide the accuracy needed to detect any out-of-family or out-of-specification anomaly.

(2) An environmental level, such as for vibration or temperature, used to satisfy a component test requirement of this appendix must include the environment design margin required by appendix D of this part. The environmental level must account for any test equipment tolerance to ensure that the component experiences the required margin.
