###### Capacity.

(a)A flight termination system battery must have a manufacturer-specified capacity of no less than the sum total amp-hour and pulse capacity needed for:

(1) Any self discharge;

(2) All load and activation checks;

(3) All launch countdown checks;

(4) Any potential hold time;

(5) Any potential number of preflight re-tests due to potential schedule delays including the number of potential launch attempts that the battery could experience before it would have to be replaced;

(6) Two arm and two destruct command loads at the end of the flight; and

(7) A flight capacity of no less than 150% of the capacity needed to support a normal flight from liftoff to the planned safe flight state. For a launch vehicle that uses solid propellant, the flight capacity must be no less than a 30-minute hang-fire hold time.
