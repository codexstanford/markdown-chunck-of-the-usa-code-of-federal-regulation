means to report ticket information as it appears on the ticket at the time the ticket was issued or reissued just prior to first known flown lift usage. For purposes of this part, any change to an existing ticket prior to the first segment being flown that results in a change to the ticket amount should be considered as requiring the ticket to be reissued. Any changes made to the ticket after the first segment is flown or that are incidental to the ticket value should not be considered as requiring the ticket to be reissued. For example, a last-minute schedule change by the carrier to an itinerary before first known flown lift usage that does not result in a change in the amount paid and does not change the intended trip destination should not be considered as a reissued ticket in this context. Partial reissued tickets shall not be included in the collection.
