(1) Violation of any safety-related requirement imposed by statute or by rule of a government agency.

(2) Liability assumed by the carrier under an agreement to raise the liability limitations of the Warsaw Convention by signing a counterpart to an agreement of carriers (such as the Montreal Agreement, 18900, signed May 13, 1966, agreeing to a limit on the carrier's liability for injury or death of passengers of $75,000 per passenger), or any amendment to such agreement that may be approved by the Department and to which the carrier becomes a party.
