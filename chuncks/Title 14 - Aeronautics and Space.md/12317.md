###### Firing tests.

(f)(1) General. A firing test of an ordnance interrupter, rotor lead, or booster charge must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must demonstrate that the initiation and output energy transfer of each ordnance charge satisfies all its performance specifications and that the component does not fragment;

(ii) The number of samples that the test must fire and the test conditions, including firing current and temperature, must satisfy each table of this section;

(iii) Before initiation, each component sample must experience the required temperature for enough time to achieve thermal equilibrium;

(iv) The test of an ordnance interrupter must simulate the flight configuration, including the explosive transfer system lines on the input and output;

(v) Each test of a rotor lead or booster charge must subject the component to an energy source that simulates the flight energy source;

(vi) Each test must measure each ordnance output using a measuring device, such as a swell cap or dent block, to demonstrate that the output satisfies all its performance specifications; and

(vii) For a single interrupter that contains more than one firing path, the test must demonstrate that the initiation of one firing path does not adversely affect the performance of any other path.
