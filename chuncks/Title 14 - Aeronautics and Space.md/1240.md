####### ยง 25.121 Climb: One-engine-inoperative.
######## Takeoff; landing gear extended.,V,V

(a)In the critical takeoff configuration existing along the flight path (between the points at which the airplane reachesand at which the landing gear is fully retracted) and in the configuration used in ยง 25.111 but without ground effect, the steady gradient of climb must be positive for two-engine airplanes, and not less than 0.3 percent for three-engine airplanes or 0.5 percent for four-engine airplanes, atand with-

(1) The critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at the power or thrust available when retraction of the landing gear is begun in accordance with ยง 25.111 unless there is a more critical power operating condition existing later along the flight path but before the point at which the landing gear is fully retracted; and

(2) The weight equal to the weight existing when retraction of the landing gear is begun, determined under ยง 25.111.
