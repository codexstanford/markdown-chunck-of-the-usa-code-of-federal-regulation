###### Safe-and-Arm Devices.

(3)For any electro-mechanical safe-and-arm device with an internal explosive, a qualification thermal cycle test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The qualification thermal cycle must range from 10 &#xB0;C above the acceptance test high temperature to 10 &#xB0;C below the acceptance test low temperature;

(ii) The test must subject the component to no less than three times the acceptance-number of thermal cycles. For each component, the acceptance-number of thermal cycles must satisfy section E417.13(d)(1). For each cycle, the dwell-time at each high and low temperature must last long enough for the component to achieve internal thermal equilibrium and must last no less than one hour;

(iii) When heating or cooling the component, the temperature must change at an average rate of 1 &#xB0;C per minute or the maximum predicted rate, whichever is greater;

(iv) The test must measure all performance parameters when the component is at ambient temperature before beginning the first thermal cycle. The test must measure all performance parameters when the component is at the high and low temperatures during the first, middle, and last thermal cycles. The test must measure all performance parameters when the component is at ambient temperature after completing the last cycle; and

(v) The test must continuously monitor and record all critical performance and status-of-health parameters during all temperature cycles and transitions using a resolution and sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation.
