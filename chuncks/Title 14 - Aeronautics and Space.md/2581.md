###### Lights
####### § 27.1389 Position light distribution and intensities.
######## Intensities in overlaps between adjacent signals.

(3)No intensity in any overlap between adjacent signals may exceed the values in § 27.1395, except that higher intensities in overlaps may be used with main beam intensities substantially greater than the minima specified in §§ 27.1391 and 27.1393, if the overlap intensities in relation to the main beam intensities do not adversely affect signal clarity. When the peak intensity of the forward position lights is greater than 100 candles, the maximum overlap intensities between them may exceed the values in § 27.1395 if the overlap intensity in Area A is not more than 10 percent of peak position light intensity and the overlap intensity in Area B is not more than 2.5 percent of peak position light intensity.
