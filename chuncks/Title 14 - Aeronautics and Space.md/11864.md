###### Ballistic coefficient.

(5)The mean ballistic coefficient (&#x3B2;) and plus and minus three-sigma values of the &#x3B2; for each fragment class. A launch operator must provide graphs of the coefficient of drag (C) as a function of Mach number for the nominal and three-sigma &#x3B2; variations for each fragment shape. The launch operator must label each graph with the shape represented by the curve and reference area used to develop the curve. A launch operator must provide a Cvs. Mach curve for any axial, transverse, and tumble orientations for any fragment that will not stabilize during free-fall conditions. For any fragment that may stabilize during free-fall, a launch operator must provide Cvs. Mach curves for the stability angle of attack. If the angle of attack where the fragment stabilizes is other than zero degrees, a launch operator must provide both the coefficient of lift (C) vs. Mach number and the Cvs. Mach number curves. The launch operator must provide the equations for each Cvs. Mach curve.
