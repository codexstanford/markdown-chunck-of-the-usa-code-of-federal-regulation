(2) Include a worst-case release scenario analysis or a maximum-credible release scenario analysis for each process that involves a toxic propellant or other chemical;

(3) Determine if toxic release can occur based on an evaluation of the chemical compositions and quantities of propellants, other chemicals, vehicle materials, and projected combustion products, and the possible toxic release scenarios;

(4) Account for both normal combustion products and any unreacted propellants and phase change or chemical derivatives of released substances; and

(5) Account for any operational constraints and emergency procedures that provide protection from toxic release.
