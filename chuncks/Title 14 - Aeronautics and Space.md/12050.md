(B) Doppler shifts of the carrier center frequency; and

(C) Shifts in flight hardware center frequency during flight at the manufacturer guaranteed receiver sensitivity.

(ii) The operational bandwidth must account for tone deviation and the receiver sensitivity must not vary by more than 3dB across the bandwidth.
