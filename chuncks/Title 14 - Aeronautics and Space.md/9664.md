means a list maintained and published by the Office of Airline Information (OAI). Carriers report O&D data consistent with these regulations, but a carrier is not required to report until OAI adds the carrier to the Reporting Carriers List. Carriers must also determine the responsible reporting carrier for Category Two tickets using the first reporting carrier rule and should use the Reporting Carriers List to determine the responsible reporting carrier.
