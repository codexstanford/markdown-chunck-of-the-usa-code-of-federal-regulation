###### Level flyover reference profile.

(d)The beginning of the level flyover reference profile is represented by helicopter position D(Figure H2). The helicopter approaches position Din level flight 492 feet above ground level as measured at Station A. Reference airspeed must be either 0.9V; 0.9V; 0.45V+ 65 kts (0.45V+ 120km/h); or 0.45V+ 65kts (0.45V+ 120 km/h), whichever of the four speeds is least. The helicopter crosses directly overhead station A in level flight and proceeds to position J.

(e) For noise certification purposes, Vis defined as the airspeed in level flight obtained using the minimum specified engine torque corresponding to maximum continuous power available for sea level pressure of 2,116 psf (1,013.25 hPa) at 77 &#xB0;F (25 &#xB0;C) ambient conditions at the relevant maximum certificated weight. The value of Vis the never-exceed airspeed. The values of Vand Vthat are used for noise certification must be listed in the approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual.
