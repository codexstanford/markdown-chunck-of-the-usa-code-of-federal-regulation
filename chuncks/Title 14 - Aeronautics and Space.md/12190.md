###### Out of band rejection.

(2)The test must demonstrate that the receiver decoder does not degrade in performance when subjected to any out-of-band vehicle or ground transmitter source that it could encounter from liftoff to the planned safe flight state. The test must ensure the receiver decoder does not respond to frequencies, from 10 MHz to 1000 MHz except at the receiver specified operational bandwidth. The test must demonstrate that the radio frequency rejection of out of band signals provides a minimum of 60 dB beyond eight times the maximum specified operational bandwidth. The test frequencies must include all expected interfering transmitting sources using a minimum bandwidth of 20% of each transmitter center frequency, receiver image frequencies and harmonics of the assigned center frequency.
