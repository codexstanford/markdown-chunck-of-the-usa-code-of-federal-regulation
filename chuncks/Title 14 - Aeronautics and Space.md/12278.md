###### Barrier alignment.

(o)A barrier alignment test must consist of a statistical firing series of safe-and-arm device samples. The test must demonstrate that the device's safe to arm transition motion provides for ordnance initiation with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level. The test must also demonstrate that the device's arm to safe transition motion provides for no ordnance initiation with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level. This test may employ a reusable safe-and-arm subassembly that simulates the flight configuration.
