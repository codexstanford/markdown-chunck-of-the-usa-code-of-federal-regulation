###### Sideline microphones.

(iv)For the sideline flight path, the correction term is calculated using the formula-

(2) The adjustment procedure described in this section shall apply to the sideline microphones in the take-off, overflight, and approach cases. Although the noise emission is strongly dependent on the directivity pattern, variable from one helicopter type to another, the propagation angle &#x3B8; shall be the same for test and reference flight paths. The elevation angle &#x3C8; shall not be constrained but must be determined and reported. The certification authority shall specify the acceptable limitations on &#x3C8;. Corrections to data obtained when these limits are exceeded shall be applied using FAA approved procedures.

Compliance with this part of this appendix must be shown with noise levels measured, evaluated, and calculated as prescribed under Parts B and C of this appendix.
