"Flame propagation" means the furthest distance of the propagation of visible flame towards the far end of the test specimen, measured from the midpoint of the ignition source flame. Measure this distance after initially applying the ignition source and before all flame on the test specimen is extinguished. The measurement is not a determination of burn length made after the test.

"Radiant heat source" means an electric or air propane panel.

"Thermal/acoustic insulation" means a material or system of materials used to provide thermal and/or acoustic protection. Examples include fiberglass or other batting material encapsulated by a film covering and foams.

"Zero point" means the point of application of the pilot burner to the test specimen.
