###### Activated stand time.

(l)An activated stand time test must demonstrate that a silver-zinc battery or cell satisfies all its performance specifications after it is activated and subjected to the environments that the battery or cell will experience from the time it is activated until flight. This must include all of the following:

(1) The test environment must simulate the pre-flight battery or cell conditioning environments, including the launch vehicle installation environment;

(2) The test environment must simulate the worst case temperature exposure and any thermal cycling, such as due to any freezer storage, and any diurnal cycling on the launch vehicle;

(3) The test must measure the battery or cell's open-circuit voltage at the beginning and again at the end of the activated stand time to demonstrate that it satisfies its performance specifications; and

(4) The test must apply an electrical load to the battery or cell at the end of the activated stand time to demonstrate whether the battery or cell is in a peroxide or monoxide chemical state that satisfies its performance specifications before undergoing any other operating environmental test.
