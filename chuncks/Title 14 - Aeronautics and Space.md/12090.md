###### Test failures.

(d)If a test of a component results in a failure, the component does not satisfy the test requirement. Each of the following is a test failure:

(1) Any component sample that does not satisfy a performance specification;

(2) Any failure to accomplish a test objective;

(3) Any component sample with a test result that indicates that the component is out-of-family when compared to other samples of the component, even if the component satisfies other test criteria;

(4) Any unexpected change in the performance of a component sample occurring at any time during testing;

(5) Any component sample that exhibits any sign that a part is stressed beyond its design limit, such as a cracked circuit board, bent clamps, worn part, or loose connector or screw, even if the component passes the final functional test;

(6) When component examination shows any defect that could adversely affect the component's performance;

(7) Any discontinuity or dropout in a measured performance parameter that could prevent the component from satisfying a performance specification;

(8) Any inadvertent output; or

(9) Any indication of internal component damage.
