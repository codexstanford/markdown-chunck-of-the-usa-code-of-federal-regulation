### PART 1204 - ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY AND POLICY
#### Subpart 14 - Use of NASA Airfield Facilities by Aircraft Not Operated for the Benefit of the Federal Government
##### ยง 1204.1407 Procedure in the event of an unauthorized use.

Any aircraft not operated for benefit of the Federal Government which lands at a NASA airfield facility without obtaining prior permission from the approving authority, except in a bona fide emergency, is in violation of this subpart. Such aircraft will experience delays while authorization for departure is obtained pursuant to this subpart and may, contrary to the other provisions of this subpart, be required, at the discretion of the approving authority, to pay a user fee of not less than $100. Before the aircraft is permitted to depart, the approving authority will require full compliance with this subpart 1204.14, including the filing of a complete report explaining the reasons for the unauthorized landing. Violators could also be subject to legal liability for unauthorized use. When it appears that the violation of this subpart was deliberate or is a repeated violation, the matter will be referred to the Aircraft Management Office, NASA Headquarters, which will then grant any departure authorization.
