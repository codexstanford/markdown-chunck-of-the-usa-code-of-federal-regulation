###### Power source thermal design.

(4)A flight termination system power source, including any battery, must satisfy all its performance specifications when exposed to preflight and flight thermal environments. The power source must satisfy the following:

(i) A silver zinc battery must satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to the acceptance-number of thermal cycles from 10 &#xB0;C lower than the lowest temperature of the battery's maximum predicted temperature range to 10 &#xB0;C higher than the highest temperature of the range. An exception is that each thermal cycle may range from 5.5 &#xB0;C lower than the lowest temperature of the battery's maximum predicted temperature range to 10 &#xB0;C higher than the highest temperature of the range if the launch operator monitors the battery's operating temperature on the launch vehicle with an accuracy of no less than +/-1.5 &#xB0;C.

(ii) A nickel cadmium battery must satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to three times the acceptance-number of thermal cycles from the lower of -20 &#xB0;C or the predicted lowest temperature minus 10 &#xB0;C, to the higher of 40 &#xB0;C or the predicted highest temperature plus 10 &#xB0;C.

(iii) Any other power source must satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to three times the acceptance-number of thermal cycles from 10 &#xB0;C lower than the lowest temperature of the maximum predicted temperature range to 10 &#xB0;C higher the highest temperature of the range.
