(3) Processes to ensure development personnel are trained, qualified, and capable of performing their role;

(4) Processes that trace requirements to verification and validation evidence;

(5) Processes for configuration management that specify the content of each released version of a computing system safety item;

(6) Processes for testing that verify and validate all safety requirements to the extent required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section;

(7) Reuse policies that verify and validate the safety requirements for reused computing system safety items; and

(8) Third-party product use policies that verify and validate the safety requirements for any third-party product.
