####### Command control system antennas.

(l)A command control system antenna or antenna system must satisfy all of the following:

(1) The antenna system must provide two or more command signals to any command destruct system throughout normal flight and in the event of a launch vehicle failure regardless of launch vehicle orientation;

(2) Each antenna beam-width must:

(i) Allow for complete transmission of the command destruct sequence of signal tones before a malfunctioning launch vehicle can exit the 3-dB point of the antenna pattern;

(ii) When the vehicle is centered in the antenna pattern at the beginning of the malfunction, account for the launch vehicle's malfunction turn capability determined by the analysis of ยง 417.209, the data loss flight times of ยง 417.219, and the time delay of ยง 417.221.

(iii) Encompass the boundaries of normal flight for the portion of flight that the antenna is scheduled to support; and

(iv) Account for any error associated with launch vehicle tracking and pointing of the antenna;

(3) The location of each antenna must provide for an unobstructed line of site between the antenna and the launch vehicle;

(4) The antenna system must provide a continuous omni-directional radio carrier pattern that covers the launch vehicle's flight from the launch point to no less than an altitude of 50,000 feet above sea level, unless the system uses a steerable antenna that satisfies paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section for the worst-case launch vehicle malfunction that could occur during that portion of flight;

(5) An antenna must radiate circularly polarized radio waves that are compatible with the flight termination system antennas on the launch vehicle; and

(6) Any steerable antenna must allow for control of the antenna manually at the antenna site or by remote slaving data from a launch vehicle tracking source. A steerable antenna's positioning lag, accuracy, and slew rates must allow for tracking a nominally performing launch vehicle within one half of the antenna's beam-width and for tracking a malfunctioning launch vehicle to satisfy paragraph (l)(2) of this section.
