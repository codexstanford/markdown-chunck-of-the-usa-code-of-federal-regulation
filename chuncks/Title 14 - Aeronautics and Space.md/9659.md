####### Origin

means an airport or terminus in the ticket sequence of travel where a passenger boards a flight stage. Qualifying airports or terminus will be specified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Office of Airline Information. Airport, or terminus, codes are most commonly assigned by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and occasionally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) depending on the jurisdiction of the airport. A common private industry source of these industry designator codes is 3rd party schedule products and OAI will use one of these products as a source where possible. Where none exists, OAI will furnish a code upon request.
