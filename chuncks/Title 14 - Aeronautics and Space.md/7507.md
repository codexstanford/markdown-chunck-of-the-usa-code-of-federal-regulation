###### Turbine engine bleed air systems.

49.Turbine engine bleed air systems of turbopropeller powered airplanes must be investigated to determine-

(a) That no hazard to the airplane will result if a duct rupture occurs. This condition must consider that a failure of the duct can occur anywhere between the engine port and the airplane bleed service; and

(b) That, if the bleed air system is used for direct cabin pressurization, it is not possible for hazardous contamination of the cabin air system to occur in event of lubrication system failure.
