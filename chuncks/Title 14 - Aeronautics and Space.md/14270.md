###### Employees who are separating or have separated,Employees who are in the process of separating.

(c)-(1)If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor agency must submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in 5 CFR 550.1104(1) of the OPM regulations (14 CFR 1261.603(f)) for "liquidation from final check." NASA must then certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If NASA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it should notify the creditor agency and forward the copy of the debt claim and certification to the agency responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. However, the creditor agency, not NASA, must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection can be made.
