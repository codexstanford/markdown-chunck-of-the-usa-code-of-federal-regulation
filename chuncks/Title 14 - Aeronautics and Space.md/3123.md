###### Operating Limitations
####### ยง 29.1521 Powerplant limitations.
######## Continuous operation.

(c)The continuous operation must be limited by-

(1) The maximum rotational speed, which may not be greater than-

(i) The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or

(ii) The maximum value shown during the type tests;

(2) The minimum rotational speed shown under the rotor speed requirements in ยง 29.1509(c).

(3) The maximum allowable manifold pressure (for reciprocating engines);

(4) The maximum allowable turbine inlet or turbine outlet gas temperature (for turbine engines);

(5) The maximum allowable power or torque for each engine, considering the power input limitations of the transmission with all engines operating;

(6) The maximum allowable power or torque for each engine, considering the power input limitations of the transmission with one engine inoperative; and

(7) The maximum allowable temperatures for-

(i) The cylinder head or coolant outlet (for reciprocating engines);

(ii) The engine oil; and

(iii) The transmission oil.
