###### Message timing.

(xi)For any secure receiver decoder, the test must demonstrate that the receiver decoder functions reliably during any errors in timing caused by any ground transmitter tolerances. The test must demonstrate that the receiver decoder can process commands at twice the maximum and one-half the minimum timing specification of the ground system. These tolerances must include character dead-time, character on-time and inter-message dead-time.
