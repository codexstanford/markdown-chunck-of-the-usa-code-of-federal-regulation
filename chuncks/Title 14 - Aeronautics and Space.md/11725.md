####### Command transmitter failover.

(g)A command control system must include independent, redundant transmitter systems that automatically switch, or "fail-over," from a primary transmitter to a secondary transmitter when a condition exists that indicates potential failure of the primary transmitter. The switch must be automatic and provide all the same command control system capabilities through the secondary transmitter system. The secondary transmitter system must respond to any transmitter system configuration and radio message orders established for the launch. The fail-over criteria that trigger automatic switching from the primary transmitter to the secondary transmitter must account for each of the following transmitter performance parameters and failure indicators:

(1) Low transmitter power;

(2) Center frequency shift;

(3) Out of tolerance tone frequency;

(4) Out of tolerance message timing;

(5) Loss of communication between central control and transmitter site;

(6) Central control commanded status and site status disagree;

(7) Transmitter site fails to respond to a configuration or radiation order within a specified period of time; and

(8) For a tone-based system, tone deviation and tone imbalance.
