###### General.

(a)This section applies to each service-life extension test of an ordnance component that is identified by any table of this appendix. A service-life extension test must demonstrate that an ordnance component will satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to non-operating and operating environments throughout its initial service-life and throughout any extension to the service-life. An ordnance component must undergo a service-life extension test to extend its service-life if its initial service-life and any previous extension will expire before the component is used for flight.
