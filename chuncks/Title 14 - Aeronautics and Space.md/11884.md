This section applies to determining a gate as required by ยง 417.217 and the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by ยง 417.203(e). The analysis must determine the portion, referred to as a gate, of a flight safety limit, through which a launch vehicle's tracking representation will be allowed to proceed without flight termination.
