###### Test equipment.

(g)All equipment used during environmental testing must provide for the test item to experience the required environmental test levels. Any test fixture used to simultaneously test multiple component samples must ensure that each component sample, at each mounting location on the fixture experiences each required environmental test level. Any difference in a qualification or acceptance test fixture or cable must undergo an evaluation to ensure that flight hardware is not subjected to stresses greater than that which the unit experiences during qualification.
