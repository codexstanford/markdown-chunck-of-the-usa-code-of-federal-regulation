###### Abbreviated closed-loop test of a secure high-alphabet command destruct system.

(6)Any flight termination system that uses a secure high-alphabet command receiver decoder must undergo an abbreviated closed-loop test if, due to a launch scrub or delay, more than 72 hours pass since the end-to-end test of paragraph (h)(5) of this section. The test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The flight termination system must undergo the test in its final flight configuration with all flight destruct initiators connected and in a safe condition;

(ii) The test must occur just before launch support tower rollback or other similar final countdown event that suspends access to the launch vehicle;

(iii) Each command receiver decoder must undergo the test powered by the flight batteries;

(iv) The test must exercise all command receiver decoder functions critical to flight termination system operation during flight except the destruct function, including the pilot or check tone, in a closed-loop test configuration using ground support testing equipment hardwired to the launch vehicle radio frequency receiving system; and

(v) The test must demonstrate that the launch vehicle command destruct system, including each command receiver decoder and all batteries, is functioning properly.
