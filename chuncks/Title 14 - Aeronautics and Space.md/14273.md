### PART 1261 - PROCESSING OF MONETARY CLAIMS (GENERAL)
#### Subpart 1261.6 - Collection by Offset From Indebted Government Employees
##### ยง 1261.606 Salary offset request by a creditor agency other than NASA (the current paying agency).
###### Official personnel folder insertion; new paying agency.

(ii)Information on the debt claim must be inserted in the employee's official personnel folder along with a copy of the certification of the amount which has been collected. Upon receiving the official personnel folder, the new paying agency must resume the collection from the employee's current pay account and notify the employee and the creditor agency of the resumption. It will not be necessary for the creditor agency to repeat the due process procedures described by 5 U.S.C. 5514 of this subpart in order to resume the collection. However, it will be the responsibility of the creditor agency to review the debt upon receiving NASA's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.
