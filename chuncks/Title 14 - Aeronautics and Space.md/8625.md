(a) A reduction in apportioned funds will not take effect until the first fiscal year following the year in which the collection of the PFC is begun and will be applied in each succeeding fiscal year in which the public agency imposes the PFC.

(b) The reduction in apportioned funds is calculated at the beginning of each fiscal year and shall be an amount equal to-

(1) In the case of a fee of $3 or less, 50 percent of the projected revenues from the fee in the fiscal year but not by more than 50 percent of the amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this section; and
