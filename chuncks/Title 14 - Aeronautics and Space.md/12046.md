###### Output functions and monitoring.

(k)An electronic component must provide for all of the following output functions and monitoring:

(1) Each series redundant branch in any firing circuit of an electronic component that prevents a single failure point from issuing a destruct output must include a monitoring circuit or test points that verify the integrity of each redundant branch after assembly;

(2) Any piece-part used in a firing circuit must have the capacity to output at least 1.5 times the maximum firing current for no less than 10 times the duration of the maximum firing pulse;

(3) An electronic component's destruct output circuit and all its parts must deliver the required output power to the intended output load while operating with any input voltage that is within the component's input power operational design limits;

(4) An electronic component must include monitoring circuits that provide for monitoring the health and performance of the component including the status of any command output; and

(5) The maximum leakage current through an electronic component's destruct output port must:

(i) Not degrade the performance of downstream circuitry;

(ii) Be 20 dB lower than the level that could degrade the performance of any downstream ordnance initiation system or component, such as any electro-explosive device; and

(iii) Be 20 dB lower than the level that could result in inadvertent initiation of any downstream ordnance.
