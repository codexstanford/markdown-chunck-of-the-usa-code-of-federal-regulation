###### ยง 417.219 Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analyses.
####### Planned safe flight state.

(c)For a launch vehicle that performs normally during all portions of flight, the planned safe flight state is the point during the nominal flight of a launch vehicle where:

(1) No launch vehicle component, debris, or hazard can impact or affect a populated or otherwise protected area for the remainder of the launch;

(2) The launch vehicle achieves orbital insertion; or

(3) The launch vehicle's state vector reaches a state where the absence of a flight safety system would not significantly increase the accumulated risk from debris impacts and maintains positive flight safety system control to the maximum extent feasible.
