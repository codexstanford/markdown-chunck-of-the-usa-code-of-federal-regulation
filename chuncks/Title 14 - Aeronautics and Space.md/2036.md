(f)(1) The calibration factor is calculated as follows:

(2) Heat release rates may be calculated from the reading of the thermopile output voltage at any instant of time as:

(3) The integral of the heat release rate is the total heat release as a function of time and is calculated by multiplying the rate by the data sampling frequency in minutes and summing the time from zero to two minutes.
