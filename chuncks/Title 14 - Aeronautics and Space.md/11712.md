###### ยง 417.229 Far-field overpressure blast effects analysis.
####### Analysis constraints.

(b)The analysis must account for:

(1) The potential for distant focus overpressure or overpressure enhancement given current meteorological conditions and terrain characteristics;

(2) The potential for broken windows due to peak incident overpressures below 1.0 psi and related casualties;

(3) The explosive capability of the launch vehicle at impact and at altitude and potential explosions resulting from debris impacts, including the potential for mixing of liquid propellants;

(4) Characteristics of the launch vehicle flight and the surroundings that would affect the population's susceptibility to injury, such as, shelter types and time of day of the proposed launch;

(5) Characteristics of the potentially affected windows, including their size, location, orientation, glazing material, and condition; and

(6) The hazard characteristics of the potential glass shards, such as falling from upper building stories or being propelled into or out of a shelter toward potentially occupied spaces.
