###### ยง 450.117 Trajectory analysis for normal flight.
####### Application requirements.

(d)An applicant must submit the following:

(1) A description of the methods used to characterize the vehicle's flight behavior throughout normal flight, in accordance with ยง 450.115(c).

(2) The quantitative input data, including uncertainties, used to model the vehicle's normal flight in six degrees of freedom.

(3) The worst atmospheric conditions under which flight might be attempted, and a description of how the operator will evaluate the atmospheric conditions and uncertainty in the atmospheric conditions prior to initiating the operation;

(4) Representative normal flight trajectory analysis outputs, including the position velocity, and orientation for each second of flight for-

(i) The nominal trajectory;

(ii) A set of trajectories that characterize variability in the intended trajectory based on conditions known prior to initiation of flight; and

(iii) A set of trajectories that characterize how the actual trajectory could differ from the intended trajectory due to random uncertainties.
