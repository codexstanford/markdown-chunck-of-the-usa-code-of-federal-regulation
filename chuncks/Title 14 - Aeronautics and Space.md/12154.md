###### Abbreviated status-of-health.

(e)An abbreviated status-of health test of a radio frequency receiving system component must determine any internal anomaly while the component is under environmental stress conditions. The test must include continuous monitoring of the voltage standing wave ratio and any other critical performance parameter that indicates an internal anomaly during environmental testing to detect any variations in amplitude. Any amplitude variation constitutes a test failure. The monitoring must have a sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation.
