###### Qualification humidity.

(g)A qualification humidity test or analysis must demonstrate that a component satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to the maximum predicted relative humidity environment that the component could experience when stored, transported, or installed as follows:

(1) The test or analysis must demonstrate the ability of all externally exposed surfaces to withstand the maximum predicted relative humidity environment.

(2) The test or analysis must demonstrate the ability of each internal part of a component to withstand the maximum predicted relative humidity environment unless the component is environmentally sealed and an acceptance test demonstrates that the seal works.

(3) Each test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must subject the component to no less than four thermal cycles while the component is exposed to a relative humidity of no less than 95%;

(ii) The test must measure each electrical performance parameter at the cold and hot temperatures during the first, middle and last thermal cycles; and

(iii) The test must continuously measure and record all performance and status-of-health parameters with a resolution and sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation throughout each thermal cycle.
