######## Intensities in overlaps between adjacent signals.

(3)No intensity in any overlap between adjacent signals may exceed the values in § 29.1395, except that higher intensities in overlaps may be used with the use of main beam intensities substantially greater than the minima specified in §§ 29.1391 and 29.1393 if the overlap intensities in relation to the main beam intensities do not adversely affect signal clarity.
