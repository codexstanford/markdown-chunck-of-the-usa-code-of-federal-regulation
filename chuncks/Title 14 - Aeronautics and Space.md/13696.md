##### Conditional Payment

means a NASA payment to a medical provider or eligible individual to pay for the cost of medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. Such conditional payments may be made prior to a formal determination that a psychological or medical condition is spaceflight-associated if payment has not been made or cannot reasonably be expected to be made promptly by the primary payer.
