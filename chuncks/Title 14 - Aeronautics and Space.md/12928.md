###### ยง 450.121 Debris analysis.
####### Propagation of debris.

(c)A debris analysis must compute statistically valid debris impact probability distributions. The propagation of debris from each predicted breakup location to impact must account for-

(1) All foreseeable forces that can influence any debris impact location; and

(2) All foreseeable sources of impact dispersion, including, at a minimum:

(i) The uncertainties in atmospheric conditions;

(ii) Debris aerodynamic parameters, including uncertainties;

(iii) Pre-breakup position and velocity, including uncertainties; and

(iv) Breakup-imparted velocities, including uncertainties.
