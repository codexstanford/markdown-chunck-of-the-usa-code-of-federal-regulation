###### Ordnance thermal design.

(6)An ordnance device and any associated hardware must satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to the acceptance-number of thermal cycles from the lower of -54 &#xB0;C or the predicted lowest temperature minus 10 &#xB0;C, to the higher of 71 &#xB0;C or the predicted highest temperature plus 10 &#xB0;C. Each cycle must include a two-hour dwell time at each temperature extreme and a thermal rate of change between the extremes must be no less than the maximum predicted thermal rate of change or 3 &#xB0;C per minute, whichever is greater.
