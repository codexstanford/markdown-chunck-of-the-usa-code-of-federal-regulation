A36.9.3.4

A36.9.3.4.1 To account for differences between the parameters affecting engine noise as measured in the certification flight tests, and those calculated or specified in the reference conditions, the source noise adjustment must be calculated and applied. The adjustment is determined from the manufacturer's data approved by the FAA. Typical data used for this adjustment are illustrated in Figure A36-8 that shows a curve of EPNL versus the engine control parameter &#x3BC;, with the EPNL data being corrected to all the other relevant reference conditions (airplane mass, speed and altitude, air temperature) and for the difference in noise between the test engine and the average engine (as defined in section B36.7(b)(7)). A sufficient number of data points over a range of values of &#x3BC;is required to calculate the source noise adjustments for lateral, flyover and approach noise measurements.

A36.9.3.4.2 Calculate adjustment term Δby subtracting the EPNL value corresponding to the parameter &#x3BC; from the EPNL value corresponding to the parameter &#x3BC;. Add Δarithmetically to the EPNL value calculated from the measured data.
