###### Safe-and-arm transition.

(c)This test must demonstrate that the safe-and-arm transition, such as rotational or sliding operation, satisfies all its performance specifications. This must include all of the following:

(1) The test must demonstrate that the safe-and-arm monitors accurately determine safe-and-arm transition and whether the safe-and-arm device is in the proper configuration;

(2) The test must demonstrate that a safe-and-arm device is not susceptible to inadvertent initiation or degradation in performance of the electro-explosive device during pre-flight processing; and

(3) The test must demonstrate the ability of a safe-and-arm device to satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to five times the maximum predicted number of safe-to-arm and arm-to-safe cycles.
