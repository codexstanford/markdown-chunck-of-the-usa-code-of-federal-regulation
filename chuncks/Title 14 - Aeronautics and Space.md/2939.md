######## Endurance tests; operating lubricants.

(p)To be approved for use in rotor drive and control systems, lubricants must meet the specifications of lubricants used during the tests prescribed by this section. Additional or alternate lubricants may be qualified by equivalent testing or by comparative analysis of lubricant specifications and rotor drive and control system characteristics. In addition-

(1) At least three 10-hour cycles required by this section must be conducted with transmission and gearbox lubricant temperatures, at the location prescribed for measurement, not lower than the maximum operating temperature for which approval is requested;

(2) For pressure lubricated systems, at least three 10-hour cycles required by this section must be conducted with the lubricant pressure, at the location prescribed for measurement, not higher than the minimum operating pressure for which approval is requested; and

(3) The test conditions of paragraphs (p)(1) and (p)(2) of this section must be applied simultaneously and must be extended to include operation at any one-engine-inoperative rating for which approval is requested.
