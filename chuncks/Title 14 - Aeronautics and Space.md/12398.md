#### PART 417 - LAUNCH SAFETY
##### Appendix I to Part 417 - Methodologies for Toxic Release Hazard Analysis and Operational Procedures

This appendix provides methodologies for performing toxic release hazard analysis for the flight of a launch vehicle as required by ยง 417.227 and for launch processing at a launch site in the United States as required by ยง 417.407(f). The requirements of this appendix apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety.
