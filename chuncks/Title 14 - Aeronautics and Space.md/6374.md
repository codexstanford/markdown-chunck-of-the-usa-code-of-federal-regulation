(i) Proper operation of the controls and systems;

(ii) Proper operation of environmental and fault panels;

(iii) Data and motion limitations of simulation; and

(iv) The minimum airplane simulator equipment required by this part or part 60 of this chapter, for each maneuver and procedure completed in an FFS or a flight training device.

(d) The transition ground training for flight instructors must include the following:

(1) The approved methods, procedures, and limitations for performing the required normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures applicable to the airplane to which the flight instructor is transitioning.

(i) Proper operation of the controls and systems;

(ii) Proper operation of environmental and fault panels;

(iii) Data and motion limitations of simulation; and

(iv) The minimum airplane simulator equipment required by this part or part 60 of this chapter, for each maneuver and procedure completed in an FFS or a flight training device.

(e) The initial and transition flight training for flight instructors (airplane) must include the following:

(2) Training in the operation of FFSs or flight training devices, or both, to ensure competence to conduct the flight instruction required by this part.

(h) Recurrent flight instructor ground training for flight instructors who conduct training in an FFS or a flight training device must be completed every 12 calendar months and must include the subjects required in paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
