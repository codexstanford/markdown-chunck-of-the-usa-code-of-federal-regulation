###### Abnormal voltage.

(1)Demonstrate that any circuit protection allows the receiver decoder to satisfy all its performance specifications when powered with the open circuit voltage of the receiver decoder's power source for no less than twice the expected duration of the open circuit voltage and then when powered with the minimum input voltage of the loaded voltage of the power source for no less than twice the expected duration of the loaded voltage. The test must also demonstrate that the receiver decoder satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to increasing voltage from zero volts to the nominal voltage and then decreasing voltage from nominal back to zero;
