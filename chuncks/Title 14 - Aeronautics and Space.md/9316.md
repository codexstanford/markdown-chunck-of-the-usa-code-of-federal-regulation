### Subchapter A - Economic Regulations
#### PART 218 - LEASE BY FOREIGN AIR CARRIER OR OTHER FOREIGN PERSON OF AIRCRAFT WITH CREW
##### ยง 218.6 Issuance of order disclaiming jurisdiction.
###### i.e.

If the Department finds that true operational control and safety responsibility will be vested in the lessee and not in the lessor (, that the lease transaction is in substance a true lease of aircraft rather than a charter or series of charters), and that the performance of the operations provided for in such lease will not result in the lessor's being engaged in foreign air transportation, it will issue an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter. Otherwise the application for disclaimer of jurisdiction will be denied.
