###### Link performance.

(c)A link performance test of a radio frequency component or subsystem must demonstrate that the component or subsystem satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to performance degradation caused by ground transmitter variations and non-nominal vehicle flight. This must include demonstrating all of the following:

(1) The radio frequency receiving system provides command signals to each command destruct receiver at an electromagnetic field intensity of 12 dB above the level required for reliable receiver operation over 95% of the antenna radiation sphere surrounding the launch vehicle;

(2) The radio frequency coupler insertion loss and voltage standing wave ratio at the assigned operating frequency and at the high and low frequencies of the operating bandwidth satisfy all their performance specifications; and

(3) The cable insertion loss at the assigned operating frequency and at the high and low frequencies of the operating bandwidth satisfies all its performance specifications.
