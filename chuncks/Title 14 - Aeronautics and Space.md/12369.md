###### End-to-end test of a secure high-alphabet command destruct system.

(5)Any flight termination system that uses a secure high-alphabet command receiver decoder must undergo an end-to-end test of all flight termination system subsystems, including command destruct systems and inadvertent separation destruct systems. The test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The system must undergo the test no earlier than 72 hours before the first flight attempt. After the test, if the flight is delayed more than 14 calendar days or the flight termination system configuration is broken or modified for any reason, such as to replace batteries, the system must undergo the end-to-end tests again no earlier than 72 hours before the next flight attempt;

(ii) The system must undergo the test in a closed-loop configuration using the secure flight code;

(iii) The flight termination system, except for the ordnance initiation devices, must undergo the test in its final onboard launch vehicle configuration;

(iv) The test must use a destruct initiator simulator that satisfies ยง 417.307(h) in place of each flight initiator to demonstrate that the command destruct and inadvertent separation destruct systems deliver the energy required to initiate the flight termination system ordnance;

(v) The flight termination system must undergo the test while powered by the batteries that the launch vehicle will use for flight. A flight termination system battery must not undergo recharging at any time during or after the end-to-end test. If the battery is recharged at any time before flight the system must undergo the end-to-end test again;

(vi) The test must exercise all command receiver decoder functions critical to flight termination system operation during flight, including the pilot or check tone, in a closed-loop test configuration using ground support testing equipment hardwired to the launch vehicle radio frequency receiving system;

(vii) The test must demonstrate that all primary and redundant launch vehicle flight termination system components and circuits are operational; and

(viii) The test must exercise the triggering mechanism of all electrically initiated inadvertent separation destruct systems to demonstrate that they are operational.
