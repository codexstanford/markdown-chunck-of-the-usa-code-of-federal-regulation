###### Test specimen mounting frame.

(4)Make the mounting frame for the test specimens of-inch (3.2 mm) thick steel as shown in figure 1, except for the center vertical former, which should be-inch (6.4 mm) thick to minimize warpage. The specimen mounting frame stringers (horizontal) should be bolted to the test frame formers (vertical) such that the expansion of the stringers will not cause the entire structure to warp. Use the mounting frame for mounting the two insulation blanket test specimens as shown in figure 2.
