###### No-fire energy level.

(p)A no-fire energy level test must consist of a statistical firing series of exploding bridgewire lot samples to determine the highest electrical energy level at which the exploding bridgewire will not fire with a reliability of 0.999 with a 95% confidence level when subjected to a continuous current pulse. The test must demonstrate that the no-fire energy level is no less than the no-fire energy level used in the flight termination system design and analysis.
