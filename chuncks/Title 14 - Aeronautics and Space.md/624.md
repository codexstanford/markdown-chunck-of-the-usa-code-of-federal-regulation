####### Decision on motion for disqualification.

(iii)The administrative law judge must render a decision on the motion for disqualification not later than 15 days after the motion has been filed.

If the administrative law judge finds that disqualification is not warranted, the administrative law judge must deny the motion and state the grounds for the denial on the record. If the administrative law judge fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 15 days after the motion has been filed, the motion is deemed granted.
