###### Firing tests,General.

(m)-(1)Each firing test of an exploding bridgewire must satisfy all of the following:

(i) Each test must demonstrate that the exploding bridgewire satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to qualification stress conditions;

(ii) The number of exploding bridgewire samples that each test must fire and the test conditions, including firing voltage and temperature, must satisfy each table of this section;

(iii) Before initiation, each component sample must experience the required temperature for enough time to achieve thermal equilibrium;

(iv) Each test must subject each exploding bridgewire sample to a high voltage initiation source that duplicates the exploding bridgewire firing unit output waveform and impedance, including high voltage cabling; and

(v) Each test must measure ordnance output using a measuring device, such as a swell cap or dent block, to demonstrate that the ordnance output satisfies all its performance specifications.
