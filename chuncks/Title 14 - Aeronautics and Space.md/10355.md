(d)Applications under section 40109(g) of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII shall, in addition to the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, contain evidence showing that:

(1) Because of an emergency created by unusual circumstances not arising in the normal course of business, traffic in the markets requested cannot be accommodated by air carriers holding certificates under section 41102 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII;

(2) All possible efforts have been made to accommodate the traffic by using the resources of such air carriers (including, for example, the use of foreign aircraft, or sections of foreign aircraft, under lease or charter to such air carriers, and the use of such air carriers' reservation systems to the extent practicable);

(3) The authority requested is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship for the traffic in the market that cannot be accommodated by air carriers; and

(4) In any case where an inability to accommodate traffic in a market results from a labor dispute, the grant of the requested exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in the dispute.
