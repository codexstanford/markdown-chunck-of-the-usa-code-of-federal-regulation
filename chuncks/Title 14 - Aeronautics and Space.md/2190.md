(4)is the more critical of the holding ice as defined by part II, paragraph (b)(2), of this Appendix, or the ice calculated in the applicable paragraphs (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of part II of this Appendix:

(i) For an airplane certified in accordance with ยง 25.1420(a)(2), the ice accretion defined by part II, paragraph (c)(5)(i), of this Appendix, plus a descent from 2,000 feet above the landing surface to a height of 200 feet above the landing surface with a transition to the landing configuration in the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix, plus:

(A) Pre-detection ice, as defined in part II, paragraph (b)(5), of this Appendix; and

(B) The ice accumulated during an exit maneuver, beginning with the minimum climb gradient required by ยง 25.119, from a height of 200 feet above the landing surface through one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the most critical of the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix and one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the continuous maximum icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part.

(ii) For an airplane certified in accordance with ยง 25.1420(a)(1), the ice accumulated in the maximum continuous icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part, during a descent from the maximum vertical extent of the icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part, to 2,000 feet above the landing surface in the cruise configuration, plus transition to the approach configuration and flying for 15 minutes at 2,000 feet above the landing surface, plus a descent from 2,000 feet above the landing surface to a height of 200 feet above the landing surface with a transition to the landing configuration, plus:

(A) Pre-detection ice, as described by part II, paragraph (b)(5), of this Appendix; and

(B) The ice accumulated during an exit maneuver, beginning with the minimum climb gradient required by ยง 25.119, from a height of 200 feet above the landing surface through one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the most critical of the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix and one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the continuous maximum icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part.
