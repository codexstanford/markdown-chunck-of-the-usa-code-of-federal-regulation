(b) Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles.

(d) Warning shots are not permitted outside of the prison context.

(e) Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects which must be used when the use of deadly force is not authorized by this policy.
