###### Nickel-cadmium batteries.

(d)Any nickel-cadmium flight termination system battery must undergo pre-flight processing and testing before installation on the launch vehicle and the processing and testing must satisfy all of the following:

(1) Any pre-flight processing must be equivalent to that used during qualification testing to ensure the flight battery's performance is equivalent to that of the battery samples that passed the qualification tests;

(2) Each battery must undergo all of the following tests at ambient temperature no later than one year before the intended flight date and again no earlier than two weeks before the first flight attempt:

(i) A status-of-health test that satisfies section E417.22(j);

(ii) A charge retention test that satisfies section E417.22(f); and

(iii) An electrical performance test that satisfies section E417.22(n); and

(3) The test results from the battery acceptance tests of section E417.22 and the one-year and two-week pre-flight tests of paragraph (d)(2) of this section must undergo a comparison to demonstrate that the battery satisfies all its performance specifications. The flight battery test data must undergo an evaluation to identify any out-of-family performance and to ensure that there is no degradation in electrical performance that indicates an age-related problem.

(4) In the event of a launch schedule slip, after six weeks has elapsed from a preflight test, the battery must undergo the test again no earlier than two weeks before the next launch attempt.
