###### Isolation.

(d)An isolation test of a radio frequency receiving system must demonstrate that each of the system's radio frequency couplers isolate the redundant antennas and receiver decoders from one another. The test must demonstrate that an open or short-circuit in one string of the redundant system, antenna or receiver decoder, will not prevent functioning of the other side of the redundant system. The test must demonstrate that the system satisfies all its performance specifications for isolation and is in-family.
