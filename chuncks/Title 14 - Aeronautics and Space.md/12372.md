#### PART 417 - LAUNCH SAFETY
##### Appendix G to Part 417 - Natural and Triggered Lightning Flight Commit Criteria

This appendix provides flight commit criteria for mitigating against natural lightning strikes and lightning triggered by the flight of a launch vehicle through or near an electrified environment. A launch operator may not initiate flight unless the weather conditions at the time of launch satisfy all lightning flight commit criteria of this appendix.

(a) In order to meet the lightning flight commit criteria, a launch operator must employ any:

(1) Weather monitoring and measuring equipment needed, and

(2) Procedures needed to verify compliance.

(b) When equipment or procedures, such as a field mill or calculation of the volume-averaged, height-integrated radar reflectivity (VAHIRR) of clouds, are used with the lightning flight commit criteria to increase launch opportunities, a launch operator must evaluate all applicable measurements to determine whether the measurements satisfy the criteria. A launch operator may not turn off available instrumentation to create the appearance of meeting a requirement and must use all radar reflectivity measurements within a specified volume for a VAHIRR calculation.

(c) If a launch operator proposes any alternative lightning flight commit criteria, the launch operator must clearly and convincingly demonstrate that the alternative provides an equivalent level of safety to that required by this appendix.

For the purpose of this appendix:
