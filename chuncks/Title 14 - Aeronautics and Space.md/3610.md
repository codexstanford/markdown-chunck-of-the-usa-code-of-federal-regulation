###### Takeoff profiles.

(b)(1) Figure H1 illustrates a typical takeoff profile, including reference conditions.

(i) The reference takeoff flight path is described in section H36.3(c).

(ii) The test parameters are functions of the helicopter's performance and weight and the atmospheric conditions of temperature, pressure, wind velocity and direction.

(2) For the actual takeoff, the helicopter approaches position C in level flight at 65 feet (20 meters) above ground level at the flight track noise measuring station and at either V+/-5 knots or the lowest approved speed for the climb after takeoff, whichever speed is greater.

(3) Figure H1 illustrates the significant geometrical relationships influencing sound propagation. Position L represents the helicopter location on the measured takeoff path from which PNLTM is observed at station A, and Lis the corresponding position on the reference sound propagation path. Propagation paths AL and ALboth form the same angle &#x3B8; (theta) relative to their respective flight paths.
