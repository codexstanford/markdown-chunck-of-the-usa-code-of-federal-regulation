####### Stage development.

(d)In any case in which airport development can be accomplished more economically under stage construction, federal funds may be programmed in advance for the development over two or more years under two or more grant agreements. In such a case, the FAA makes a tentative allocation of funds for both the current and future fiscal years, rather than allocating the entire federal share in one fiscal year. A grant agreement is made only during the fiscal year in which funds are authorized to be obligated. Advance planning and engineering grants are not made under this paragraph.
