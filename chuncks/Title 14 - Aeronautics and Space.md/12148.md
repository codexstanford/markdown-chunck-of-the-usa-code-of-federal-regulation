###### Service-life.

(b)An ordnance component must undergo any service-life extension test before the component's initial service-life expires and again before each service-life extension expires. The initial service-life of an ordnance component, including any component that contains ordnance or is used to directly initiate ordnance, must start upon completion of the initial production lot sample acceptance tests and must include both storage time and time after installation until completion of flight. The test tables of this appendix identify the options for the length of any service-life extension for each type of ordnance component.
