######## Time for filing.

(a)Within such period after the date of service of any tentative decision by the DOT decisionmaker as may be fixed therein, any party may file a brief addressed to the DOT decisionmaker in support of his or her exceptions to such decision or in opposition to the exceptions filed by any other party. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker on initial or recommended decisions of administrative law judges shall be filed only in those cases where the DOT decisionmaker grants discretionary review and orders further proceedings, pursuant to ยง 302.32(d)(2), and only upon those issues specified in the order. Such briefs shall be filed within thirty (30) days after date of service of the order granting discretionary review unless otherwise specified in the order. In cases where, because of the limited number of parties and the nature of the issues, the filing of opening, answering, and reply briefs will not unduly delay the proceeding and will assist in its proper disposition, the DOT decisionmaker may direct that the parties file briefs at different times rather than at the same time.
