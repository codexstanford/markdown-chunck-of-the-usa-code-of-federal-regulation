###### PNLT Correction.

A36.9.3.2.1.1

(a) Convert the corrected values, SPL(i), to PNLT;

(b) Calculate the correction term Δusing the following equation:

A36.9.3.2.1.2 Add Δarithmetically to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.

A36.9.3.2.2 If, during a test flight, several peak values of PNLT that are within 2 dB of PNLTM are observed, the procedure defined in section A36.9.3.2.1 must be applied at each peak, and the adjustment term, calculated according to section A36.9.3.2.1, must be added to each peak to give corresponding adjusted peak values of PNLT. If these peak values exceed the value at the moment of PNLTM, the maximum value of such exceedance must be added as a further adjustment to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.
