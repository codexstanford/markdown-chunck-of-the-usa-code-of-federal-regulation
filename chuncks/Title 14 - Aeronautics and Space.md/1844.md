The maximum operating limit speed (/airspeed or Mach Number, whichever is critical at a particular altitude) is a speed that may not be deliberately exceeded in any regime of flight (climb, cruise, or descent), unless a higher speed is authorized for flight test or pilot training operations./must be established so that it is not greater than the design cruising speedand so that it is sufficiently below/or/to make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in operations. The speed margin between/and/ormay not be less than that determined under ยง 25.335(b) or found necessary during the flight tests conducted under ยง 25.253.
