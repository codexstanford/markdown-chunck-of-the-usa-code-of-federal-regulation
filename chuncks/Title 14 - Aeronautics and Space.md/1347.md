###### Flight Maneuver and Gust Conditions
####### ยง 25.349 Rolling conditions.
######## Unsymmetrical gusts.

(b)The airplane is assumed to be subjected to unsymmetrical vertical gusts in level flight. The resulting limit loads must be determined from either the wing maximum airload derived directly from ยง 25.341(a), or the wing maximum airload derived indirectly from the vertical load factor calculated from ยง 25.341(a). It must be assumed that 100 percent of the wing air load acts on one side of the airplane and 80 percent of the wing air load acts on the other side.
