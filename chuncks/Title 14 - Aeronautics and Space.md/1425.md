####### ยง 25.529 Hull and main float landing conditions.
######## Unsymmetrical landing for hull and single float seaplanes.

(b)Unsymmetrical step, bow, and stern landing conditions must be investigated. In addition-

(1) The loading for each condition consists of an upward component and a side component equal, respectively, to 0.75 and 0.25 tan &#x3B2; times the resultant load in the corresponding symmetrical landing condition; and

(2) The point of application and direction of the upward component of the load is the same as that in the symmetrical condition, and the point of application of the side component is at the same longitudinal station as the upward component but is directed inward perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry at a point midway between the keel and chine lines.
