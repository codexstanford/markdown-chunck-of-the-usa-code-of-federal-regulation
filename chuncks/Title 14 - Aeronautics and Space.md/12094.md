###### Rework and repair of components.

(h)Components that fail a test may undergo rework and repair and must then complete the failed test and each remaining test. If a repair requires disassembly of the component or soldering operations, the component must repeat any test necessary to demonstrate that the repair corrected the original anomaly and did not cause other damage. The total number of acceptance tests experienced by a repaired component must not exceed the environments for which the component is qualified.
