Whether to review a decision is solely a matter within the discretion of the NASA Administrator. A 15-day notice of such review will be given the applicant and agency counsel, and a determination made not later than 45 days from the date of notice. The Administrator may make a final determination concerning the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings.
