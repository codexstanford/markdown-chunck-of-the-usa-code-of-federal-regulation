###### Radio frequency monitor.

(v)The test must demonstrate that the receiver decoder's monitoring circuit accurately monitors and outputs the strength of the radio frequency input signal and must satisfy all of the following:

(A) The test must show that the output of the monitor circuit is directly related and proportional to the strength of the radio frequency input signal from the threshold level to saturation.

(B) The dynamic range of the radio frequency input from the threshold level to saturation must be no less than 50 dB. The monitor circuit output from threshold to saturation must have a corresponding range that is greater than 18 dB.

(C) The test must perform periodic samples sufficient to demonstrate that the monitor satisfies all its performance specifications.

(D) The test must include the following radio frequency input levels: Quiescent; threshold; manufacturer guaranteed; beginning of saturation; and 13 dBm.

(E) The test must demonstrate that the slope of the monitor circuit output does not change polarity.
