(6)The name of the reference ellipsoid used by the trajectory analysis to approximate the average curvature of the Earth and the following information about the model:

(i) Length of semi-major axis;

(ii) Length of semi-minor axis;

(iii) Flattening parameter;

(iv) Eccentricity;

(v) Gravitational parameter;

(vi) Angular velocity of the Earth at the equator; and

(vii) If the reference ellipsoid is not a WGS-84 ellipsoidal Earth model, the equations that convert the filed ellipsoid information to the WGS-84 ellipsoid.
