###### Pre-flight testing of an exploding bridgewire.

(g)An exploding bridgewire must undergo a pre-flight test that satisfies all of the following:

(1) The test must take place no earlier than 10 calendar days before the first flight attempt. If the flight is delayed more than 14 calendar days or the flight termination system configuration is broken or modified for any reason, such as to replace batteries, the exploding bridgewire must undergo the test again no earlier than 10 calendar days before the next flight attempt. A launch operator may extend the time between the test and flight if the launch operator demonstrates that the exploding bridgewire will satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to the expected environments for the extended period of time.

(2) The test must verify the continuity of each bridgewire.

(3) Where applicable, the test must include a high voltage static test and a dynamic gap breakdown voltage test to demonstrate that any spark gap satisfies all its performance specifications.
