###### X-ray and N-ray examination.

(f)An X-ray or N-ray examination of a component must have a resolution that allows detailed inspection of the internal parts of the component and must identify any internal anomalous condition. The examination must include enough photographs, taken from different angles, to allow complete coverage of the component's internal parts. When utilized as a recurring inspection technique to accept production hardware, the examination must use the same set of angles for each sample of a component to allow for comparison. A certified technician must evaluate X-ray and N-ray photographs.
