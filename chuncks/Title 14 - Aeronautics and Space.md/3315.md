###### ยง 33.78 Rain and hail ingestion.
####### Engines for rotorcraft.

(b)As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for rotorcraft turbine engines only, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable operation during and after the ingestion of rain with an overall ratio of water droplet flow to airflow, by weight, with a uniform distribution at the inlet plane, of at least four percent. Acceptable engine operation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power loss, or other adverse engine anomalies. The rain ingestion must occur under the following static ground level conditions:

(1) A normal stabilization period at take-off power without rain ingestion, followed immediately by the suddenly commencing ingestion of rain for three minutes at takeoff power, then

(2) Continuation of the rain ingestion during subsequent rapid deceleration to minimum idle, then

(3) Continuation of the rain ingestion during three minutes at minimum idle power to be certified for flight operation, then

(4) Continuation of the rain ingestion during subsequent rapid acceleration to takeoff power.
