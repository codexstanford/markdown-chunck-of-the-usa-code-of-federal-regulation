###### ยง 171.313 Azimuth performance requirements.
####### Antenna far field patterns in the plane of scan.

(4)On boresight, the azimuth antenna mainlobe pattern must conform to Figure 10, and the beamwidth must be such that, in the installed environment, no significant lateral reflections of the mainlobe exist along the approach course. In any case the beamwidth must not exceed three degrees. Anywhere within coverage the -3 dB width of the antenna mainlobe, while scanning normally, must not be less than 25 microseconds (0.5 degree) or greater than 250 microseconds (5 degrees). The antenna mainlobe may be allowed to broaden from the value at boresight by a factor of 1/cos&#x3B8;, where &#x3B8; is the angle off boresight. The sidelobe levels must be as follows:
