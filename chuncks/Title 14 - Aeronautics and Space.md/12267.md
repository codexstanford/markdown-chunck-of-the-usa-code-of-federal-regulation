###### Firing tests.,General.

(j)(1)Each firing test of a safe-and-arm device, electro-explosive device, rotor lead, or booster charge must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must demonstrate the initiation and transfer of all ordnance charges and that the component does not fragment. For a safe-and-arm device that has more than one internal electro-explosive device, each firing test must also demonstrate that the initiation of one internal electro-explosive device does not adversely affect the performance of any other internal electro-explosive device;

(ii) The number of component samples that the test must fire and the test conditions, including firing current and temperature must satisfy each table of this section;

(iii) Before initiation, each component sample must experience the required temperature for enough time to achieve thermal equilibrium;

(iv) Each test must measure ordnance output using a measuring device, such as a swell cap or dent block, to demonstrate that the output satisfies all its performance specifications; and

(v) Each test of a safe-and-arm device or electro-explosive device must subject each sample device to a current source that duplicates the operating output waveform and impedance of the flight current source. Each test of a rotor lead or booster charge must subject the component to an energy source that simulates the flight energy source.
