###### Leak test 1:

(1)

(i) The test must measure each cell's weight to 0.001 grams to create a baseline for comparison.

(ii) The test must subject each cell, fully charged, to a vacuum of less than 10torr for no less than 20 hours. While under vacuum, the cell must undergo charging at a C/20 rate. The test must control each cell's temperature to ensure that its does not exceed the cell's maximum predicted thermal environment.

(iii) The test must measure each cell's weight after the 20-hour vacuum and demonstrate that the cell does not experience a weight loss greater than three-sigma from the average weight loss for each cell in the lot.

(iv) Any cell that fails the weight-loss test of paragraph (h)(3) of this section must undergo cleaning and discharge. The cell must then undergo a full charge and then inspection with a chemical indicator. If the chemical indicator shows that the cell has a leak, a launch operator may not use the cell in any further test or flight.
