(1) The term 0.001[&#x3B1;()-&#x3B1;()]QK is the adjustment for the effect of the change in sound attenuation coefficient, and &#x3B1;(i) and &#x3B1;(i)are the coefficients for the test and reference atmospheric conditions respectively, determined under section A36.7 of this appendix;

(2) The term 0.001&#x3B1;(i)(QK - QK) is the adjustment for the effect of the change in the noise path length on the sound attenuation;

(3) The term 20 log(QK/QK) is the adjustment for the effect of the change in the noise path length due to the "inverse square" law;

(4) QK and QKare measured in feet and &#x3B1;(i) and &#x3B1;(i)are expressed in dB/1000 ft.

A36.9.3.2.1(b) For calculations using the International System of Units:

(1) The term 0.01[&#x3B1;(i) - &#x3B1;(i)]QK is the adjustment for the effect of the change in sound attenuation coefficient, and &#x3B1;(i) and &#x3B1;(i)are the coefficients for the test and reference atmospheric conditions respectively, determined under section A36.7 of this appendix;

(2) The term 0.01&#x3B1;(i)(QK - QK) is the adjustment for the effect of the change in the noise path length on the sound attenuation;

(3) The term 20 log(QK/QK) is the adjustment for the effect of the change in the noise path length due to the inverse square law;

(4) QK and QKare measured in meters and &#x3B1;(i) and &#x3B1;(i)are expressed in dB/100 m.
