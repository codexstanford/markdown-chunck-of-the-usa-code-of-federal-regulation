(3)is the more critical of the holding ice defined by part II, paragraph (b)(2), of this Appendix, or the ice calculated in the applicable paragraphs (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of part II, of this Appendix:

(i) For an airplane certified in accordance with ยง 25.1420(a)(2), the ice accumulated during descent from the maximum vertical extent of the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix to 2,000 feet above the landing surface in the cruise configuration, plus transition to the approach configuration, plus:

(A) Pre-detection ice, as defined by part II, paragraph (b)(5), of this Appendix; and

(B) The ice accumulated during the transit at 2,000 feet above the landing surface of one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the most critical of the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix and one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the continuous maximum icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part.

(ii) For an airplane certified in accordance with ยง 25.1420(a)(1), the ice accumulated during descent from the maximum vertical extent of the maximum continuous icing conditions defined in part I of Appendix C to 2,000 feet above the landing surface in the cruise configuration, plus transition to the approach configuration, plus:

(A) Pre-detection ice, as defined by part II, paragraph (b)(5), of this Appendix; and

(B) The ice accumulated during the transit at 2,000 feet above the landing surface of one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the most critical of the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix and one cloud with a horizontal extent of 17.4 nautical miles in the continuous maximum icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part.
