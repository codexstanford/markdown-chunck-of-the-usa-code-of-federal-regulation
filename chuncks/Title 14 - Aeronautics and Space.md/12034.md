The performance factors must include frequency modulation deviation, command control transmitter inaccuracies, and variations in hardware performance during thermal and dynamic environments;

(2) A launch operator must treat any thermal protection used on a flight termination system antenna as part of the antenna; and

(3) A flight termination system antenna must be compatible with the command control system transmitting equipment.
