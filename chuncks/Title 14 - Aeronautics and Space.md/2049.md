The length of the burner tube must be 2inches (71 mm). The propane flow must be adjusted via gas pressure through an in-line regulator to produce a blue inner cone length ofinch (19 mm). Ainch (19 mm) guide (such as a thin strip of metal) may be soldered to the top of the burner to aid in setting the flame height. The overall flame length must be approximately 5 inches long (127 mm). Provide a way to move the burner out of the ignition position so that the flame is horizontal and at least 2 inches (50 mm) above the specimen plane. See figure 6.
