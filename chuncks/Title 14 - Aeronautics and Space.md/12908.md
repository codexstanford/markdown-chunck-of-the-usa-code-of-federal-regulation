####### Containment.

(b)To use physical containment as a hazard control strategy, an operator must-

(1) Develop the flight hazard area in accordance with ยง 450.133;

(2) Ensure that the launch vehicle does not have sufficient energy for any hazards associated with its flight to reach outside the flight hazard area;

(3) Ensure the hazard area is clear of the public and critical assets; and

(4) Apply other mitigation measures necessary to ensure no public or critical asset exposure to hazards, such as control of public access or wind placards.
