###### Charge retention.

(f)A charge retention test must demonstrate that a nickel-cadmium battery or cell consistently retains its charge and provides its required capacity, including the required capacity margin, from the final charge used prior to flight to the end of flight. The test must satisfy the status-of-heath test requirements of ยง E417.3(f) and satisfy all of the following steps in the following order:

(1) The test must begin with the battery or cell fully charged. The battery or cell must undergo an immediate capacity discharge to develop a baseline capacity for comparison to its charge retention performance;

(2) The battery or cell must undergo complete charging and then storage at 20 &#xB0;C +/-2 &#xB0;C for 72 hours;

(3) The battery or cell must undergo discharging to determine its capacity; and

(4) The test must demonstrate that each cell or battery's capacity is greater than 90% of the baseline capacity of paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the test must demonstrate that the capacity retention is in-family.
