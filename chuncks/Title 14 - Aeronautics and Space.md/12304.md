(1) The test environment must be no less than 30 &#xB0;C higher than the highest non-operating or operating temperature that the device could experience;

(2) The test duration must be the maximum predicted high-temperature duration or one hour, whichever is greater; and

(3) After exposure to the test environment, each exploding bridgewire sample must undergo external and internal examination, including any dissection needed to identify any auto-ignition, sublimation, or melting.
