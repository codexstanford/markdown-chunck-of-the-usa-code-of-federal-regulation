###### Pre-flight component tests.

(b)A component must undergo one or more pre-flight tests at the launch site to detect any change in performance due to any shipping, storage, or other environments that may have affected performance after the component passed the acceptance tests. Each test must measure all the component's performance parameters and compare the measurements to the acceptance test performance baseline to identify any performance variations, including any out-of-family results, which may indicate potential defects that could result in an in-flight failure.
