VI.(a) For single-pilot approval-

(1) Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp toamplitude in not more than one cycle.

(2) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less than 10 seconds must damp toamplitude in not more than two cycles.

(3) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more but less than 20 seconds must be damped.

(4) Any oscillation having a period of 20 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 20 seconds.

(5) Any aperiodic response may not achieve double amplitude in less than 6 seconds.

(b) For helicopters approved with a minimum crew of two pilots-

(1) Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp toamplitude in not more than two cycles.

(2) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less than 10 seconds must be damped.

(3) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 10 seconds.
