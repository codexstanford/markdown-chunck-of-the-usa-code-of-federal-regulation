A36.9.3.3

A36.9.3.3.1 Whenever the measured flight paths and/or the ground velocities of the test conditions differ from the reference flight paths and/or the ground velocities of the reference conditions, duration adjustments must be applied to the EPNL values calculated from the measured data. The adjustments must be calculated as described below.

A36.9.3.3.2 For the flight path shown in Figure A36-6, the adjustment term is calculated as follows:

(a) Add Δarithmetically to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.
