###### Worst-case alternative release scenario analysis.

(f)A launch operator's worst-case alternative release scenario analysis must account for the following:

(1) The worst-case release scenario for each toxic propellant and for each toxic propellant handling process;

(2) Each release event that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario that is determined in paragraph (e) of this section;

(3) Each release scenario that exceeds a toxic concentration threshold at a distance that reaches the general public;

(4) Each potential transfer hose release due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling;

(5) Each potential process piping release from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves, valve seals, and drain bleeds;

(6) Each potential process vessel or pump release due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure;

(7) Each vessel overfilling and spill, or over pressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks;

(8) Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill;

(9) Mishandling or dropping flight or ground hardware that contains toxic commodities;

(10) Each active and passive mitigation system provided they are capable of withstanding the event that triggered the release and would still be functional;

(11) History of each accident experienced by the launch operator involving the release of a toxic propellant; and

(12) Each failure scenario.
