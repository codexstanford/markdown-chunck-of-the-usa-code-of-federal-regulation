###### Capacity and overcharge at 0 &#xB0;C.

(g)A 0 &#xB0;C test of a nickel-cadmium cell must validate the cell's chemistry status-of-health and determine the cell's capacity when subjected to a high charge efficiency temperature. The test must include all of the following:

(1) Each cell must undergo repeated charge and discharge cycles at 0 &#xB0;C +/-2 &#xB0;C until all the capacities for three consecutive cycles agree to within 1% of each other; and

(2) After the charge and discharge cycles of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, each cell must undergo an inspection to demonstrate that it is not cracked.
