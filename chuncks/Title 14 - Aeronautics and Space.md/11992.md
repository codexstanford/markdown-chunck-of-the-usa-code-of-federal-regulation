###### System independence.

(d)A flight termination system must operate independently of any other launch vehicle system. The failure of another launch vehicle system must not inhibit the functioning of a flight termination system. A flight termination system may share a component with another launch vehicle system, only if the launch operator demonstrates that sharing the component will not degrade the flight termination system's reliability. A flight termination system may share a connection with another system if the connection must exist to satisfy a flight termination system requirement, such as any connection needed to:

(1) Accomplish flight termination system arming and safing;

(2) Provide data to the telemetry system; or

(3) Accomplish any engine shut-down.
