###### Electrical performance.

(k)An electrical performance test must demonstrate that a battery or cell satisfies all its performance specifications and is in-family while the battery is subjected to the electrical load profile described in paragraph (k)(7) of this section and include all of the following:

(1) The test must demonstrate that the battery or cell supplies the required current while maintaining the required voltage regulation that satisfies the manufacturer's specifications and is in family with previous test results;

(2) The test must monitor each of the battery or cell's critical electrical performance parameters; including voltage, current, and temperature, with a resolution and sample rate that detects any failure to satisfy a performance specification. For a battery, the test must monitor the battery's performance parameters and the voltage of each cell within the battery. During the current pulse portion of the load profile, the voltage monitoring must have a sample rate of once every 0.1 millisecond or better;

(3) The test must measure a battery or cell's no-load voltage before and after the application of any load to the battery or cell;

(4) A silver-zinc battery or cell must undergo this test after the battery or cell is activated and after the manufacturer's specified soak period;

(5) The test must demonstrate that the battery or cell voltage does not fall below the voltage needed to provide the minimum acceptance voltage of each electronic component that the battery powers while the battery or cell is subjected to the steady state portion of the load profile;

(6) The test must demonstrate that the battery or cell voltage does not fall below the voltage needed to provide the minimum qualification voltage of each electronic component that the battery powers while the battery or cell is subjected to the pulse portion of the load profile; and

(7) The test load profile must satisfy one of the following:

(i) For acceptance testing, the load profile must begin with a steady-state flight load that lasts for no less than 180 seconds followed without interruption by a current pulse. The pulse width must be no less than 1.5 times the ordnance initiator qualification pulse width or a minimum workmanship screening pulse width of 100 milliseconds, whichever is greater. The pulse amplitude must be no less than 1.5 times the ordnance initiator qualification pulse amplitude. After the pulse, the acceptance load profile must end with the application of a steady-state flight load that lasts for no less than 15 seconds; or

(ii) For qualification testing or any storage life testing, the load profile must begin with a steady-state flight load that lasts for no less than 180 seconds followed by a current pulse. The pulse width must be no less than three times the ordnance initiator qualification pulse width or a minimum workmanship screening pulse width of 200 milliseconds, whichever is greater. The pulse amplitude must be no less than 1.5 times the ordnance initiator qualification pulse amplitude. After the pulse, the qualification load profile must end with a steady-state flight load that lasts for no less than 15 seconds.
