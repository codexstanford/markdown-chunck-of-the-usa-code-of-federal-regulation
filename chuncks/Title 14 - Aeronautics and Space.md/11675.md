####### Alternate analysis method.

(c)The FAA will approve an alternate flight safety analysis method if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with ยง 406.3(b), that its proposed analysis method provides an equivalent level of fidelity to that required by this subpart. A launch operator must demonstrate that an alternate flight safety analysis method is based on accurate data and scientific principles and is statistically valid. The FAA will not find a launch operator's application for a license or license modification sufficiently complete to begin review under ยง 413.11 of this chapter until the FAA approves the alternate flight safety analysis method.
