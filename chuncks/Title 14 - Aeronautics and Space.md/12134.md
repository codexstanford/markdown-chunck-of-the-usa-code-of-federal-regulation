###### Qualification thermal vacuum.

(i)A qualification thermal vacuum test or analysis must demonstrate that a component satisfies all its performance specifications, including structural integrity, when subjected to the qualification thermal vacuum environment as follows:

(1) The qualification thermal vacuum environment must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The thermal vacuum pressure gradient must equal or exceed the maximum predicted rate of altitude change that the component will experience during flight;

(ii) The final vacuum dwell-time must last long enough for the component to achieve pressure equilibrium and equal or exceed the greater of the maximum predicted dwell-time or 12 hours;

(iii) During the final vacuum dwell-time, the environment must include no less than three times the maximum predicted number of thermal cycles; and

(iv) Each thermal cycle must range from 10 &#xB0;C above the acceptance thermal vacuum range, to 10 &#xB0;C below the acceptance thermal vacuum range. The acceptance thermal vacuum temperature range is described in section E417.13(e);

(2) Any test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must measure all performance parameters with the component powered at its low and high operating voltages when the component is at ambient temperature before beginning the first thermal cycle and after completing the last cycle;

(ii) The test must measure all performance parameters while the component is powered at its low and high operating voltages when the component is at the high and low temperatures during the first, middle and last thermal cycles;

(iii) The test must continuously monitor and record all critical performance and status-of-health parameters during chamber pressure reduction and the final vacuum dwell-time, with the component at its high operating voltage and using a resolution and sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation; and

(3) Any analysis must satisfy all of the following:

(i) For any low voltage component of less than 50 volts, the analysis must demonstrate that the component is not susceptible to corona, arcing, or structural failure; and

(ii) For any high voltage component of 50 volts or greater, the component must undergo a thermal vacuum test unless the component is environmentally sealed and the analysis demonstrates that any low voltage externally exposed part is not susceptible to corona, arcing, or structural failure. A component with any high voltage externally exposed part of 50 volts or greater must undergo a thermal vacuum test.
