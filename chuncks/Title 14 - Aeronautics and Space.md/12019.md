###### In-flight safing.

(d)Any safing of flight termination system ordnance during flight must satisfy all of the following:

(1) Any onboard launch vehicle hardware or software used to automatically safe flight termination system ordnance must be single fault tolerant against inadvertent safing. Any automatic safing must satisfy all of the following:

(i) Any automatic safing must occur only when the flight of the launch vehicle satisfies the safing criteria for no less than two different safing parameters or conditions, such as time of flight, propellant depletion, acceleration, or altitude. The safing criteria for each different safing parameter or condition must ensure that the flight termination system on a stage or strap-on-motor can only be safed once the stage or strap-on motor attains orbit or can no longer reach a populated or other protected area;

(ii) Any automatic safing must ensure that all flight termination system ordnance initiation devices and arming devices remain armed and all electronic flight termination system components remain powered during flight until the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section are satisfied and the system is safed; and

(iii) If operation of the launch vehicle could result in satisfaction of the safing criteria for one of the two safing parameters or conditions before normal thrust termination of the stage or strap-on motor to which the parameter or condition applies, the launch operator must demonstrate that the greatest remaining thrust, assuming a three-sigma maximum engine performance, cannot result in the stage or strap-on motor reaching a populated or other protected area;

(2) If a radio command safes a flight termination system, the command control system used for in-flight safing must be single fault tolerant against inadvertent transmission of a safing command under ยง 417.303(d).

(a) A launch operator must establish and implement written procedures to ensure that all flight termination system components are installed on a launch vehicle according to the qualified flight termination system design. The procedures must ensure that:

(1) The installation of all flight termination system mechanical interfaces is complete;

(2) Installation personnel use calibrated tools to install ordnance when a specific standoff distance is necessary to ensure that the ordnance has the desired effect on the material it is designed to cut or otherwise destroy; and

(3) Each person involved is qualified for each task that person is to perform.

(b) Flight termination system installation procedures must include:

(1) A description of each task to be performed, each facility to be used, and each hazard involved;

(2) A checklist of tools and equipment required;

(3) A list of personnel required for performing each task;

(4) Step-by-step directions written with sufficient detail for a qualified person to perform each task;

(5) Identification of any tolerances that must be met during the installation; and

(6) Steps for inspection of installed flight termination system components, including quality assurance oversight procedures.

(c) The personnel performing a flight termination system installation procedure must signify that the procedure is accomplished, and record the outcome and any data verifying successful installation.

(a) A flight termination system must interface with the launch vehicle's telemetry system to provide the data that the flight safety system crew needs to evaluate the health and status of the flight termination system prior to and during flight.

(b) The telemetry data must include:

(1) Signal strength for each command destruct receiver;

(2) Whether the power to each electronic flight termination system component is on or off;

(3) Status of output commands for each command destruct receiver and each automatic or inadvertent separation destruct system;

(4) Safe or arm status of each safe-and-arm device of sections D417.35 and D417.39;

(5) Voltage for each flight termination system battery;

(6) Current for each flight termination system battery;

(7) Status of any electrical inhibit at the system level that is critical to the operation of a flight termination system and is not otherwise identified by this appendix;

(8) Status of any exploding bridgewire firing unit, including arm input, power level, firing capacitor charge level, and trigger capacitor charge level;

(9) Temperature of each flight termination system battery, whether monitored at each battery or in the immediate vicinity of each battery so that each battery's temperature can be derived; and

(10) Status of each switch used to provide power to a flight termination system, including any switch used to change from an external power source to an internal power source.
