###### Helicopter testing procedures.

(d)(1) The helicopter testing procedures and noise measurements must be conducted and processed in a manner which yields the noise evaluation measure designated Sound Exposure Level (SEL) as defined in section J36.109(b) of this appendix.

(2) The helicopter height relative to the noise measurement point sufficient to make corrections required under section J36.205 of this appendix must be determined by an FAA-approved method that is independent of normal flight instrumentation, such as radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, laser trajectography, or photographic scaling techniques.

(3) If an applicant demonstrates that the design characteristics of the helicopter would prevent flight from being conducted in accordance with the reference test conditions prescribed under section J36.3 of this appendix, then with FAA approval, the reference test conditions used under this appendix may vary from the standard reference test conditions, but only to the extent demanded by those design characteristics which make compliance with the reference test conditions impossible.

(a) This section prescribes the flight test conditions and allowable random deviations for flyover noise tests conducted under this appendix.

(b) A test series must consist of at least six flights. The number of level flights made with a headwind component must be equal to the number of level flights made with a tailwind component over the noise measurement station:

(1) In level flight and in cruise configuration;

(2) At a height of 492 feet +/-50 feet (150 +/-15 meters) above the ground level at the noise measuring station; and

(3) Within +/-10 degrees from the zenith.

(c) Each flyover noise test must be conducted:

(1) At the reference airspeed specified in section J36.3(c) of this appendix, with such airspeed adjusted as necessary to produce the same advancing blade tip Mach number as associated with the reference conditions;

(i) Advancing blade tip Mach number (M) is defined as the ratio of the arithmetic sum of blade tip rotational speed (V) and the helicopter true air speed (V) over the speed of sound (c) at 77 degrees Fahrenheit (1135.6 ft/sec or 346.13 m/sec) such that M= (V+ V)/c; and

(ii) The airspeed shall not vary from the adjusted reference airspeed by more than +/-3 knots (+/-5 km/hr) or an equivalent FAA-approved variation from the reference advancing blade tip Mach number. The adjusted reference airspeed shall be maintained throughout the measured portion of the flyover.

(2) At rotor speed stabilized at the power on maximum normal operating rotor RPM (+/-1 percent); and

(3) With the power stabilized during the period when the measured helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of the maximum A-weighted sound level (L).

(d) The helicopter test weight for each flyover test must be within plus 5 percent or minus 10 percent of the maximum takeoff weight for which certification under this part is requested.

(e) The requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section notwithstanding, flyovers at an FAA-approved lower height may be used and the results adjusted to the reference measurement point by an FAA-approved method if the ambient noise in the test area, measured in accordance with the requirements prescribed in section J36.109 of this appendix, is found to be within 15 dB(A) of the maximum A-weighted helicopter noise level (L) measured at the noise measurement station in accordance with section J36.109 of this appendix.
