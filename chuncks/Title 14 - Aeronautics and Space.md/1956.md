###### Takeoff maximum icing.

(c)The maximum intensity of atmospheric icing conditions for takeoff (takeoff maximum icing) is defined by the cloud liquid water content of 0.35 g/m3, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets of 20 microns, and the ambient air temperature at ground level of minus 9 degrees Celsius (-9 &#xB0;C). The takeoff maximum icing conditions extend from ground level to a height of 1,500 feet above the level of the takeoff surface.
