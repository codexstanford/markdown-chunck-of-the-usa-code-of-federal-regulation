###### Load deflection.

(b)A load deflection test must demonstrate the ability of a shock or vibration isolator to withstand the full-scale deflection expected during flight while satisfying all its performance specifications and that the isolator is in-family. This must include subjecting each isolator to varying deflection increments from the null position to the full-scale flight deflection and measuring the isolator's spring constant at each deflection increment.
