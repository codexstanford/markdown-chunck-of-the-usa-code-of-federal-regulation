###### Abbreviated performance verification tests.

(e)Each abbreviated performance verification test required by any table of this appendix must satisfy all of the following:

(1) Each test must exercise all of a component's functions that are critical to a flight termination system's performance during flight

(i) while the component is subjected to each test environment; or,

(ii) for short duration environments such as shock, before and after each test;

(2) Each test must measure a sampling of the component's critical performance parameters while the component is subjected to each test environment to demonstrate that the component satisfies all its performance specifications; and

(3) Any electronic component must undergo each abbreviated performance verification test at the component's nominal operating voltage.
