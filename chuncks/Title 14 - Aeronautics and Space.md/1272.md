(1) With the landing gear retracted at high speed, the stick force curve must have a stable slope at all speeds within a range which is the greater of 15 percent of the trim speed plus the resulting free return speed range, or 50 knots plus the resulting free return speed range, above and below the trim speed (except that the speed range need not include speeds less than 1.3, nor speeds greater thannor speeds that require a stick force of more than 50 pounds), with-

(i) The wing flaps retracted;

(ii) The center of gravity in the most adverse position (see ยง 25.27);

(iii) The most critical weight between the maximum takeoff and maximum landing weights;
