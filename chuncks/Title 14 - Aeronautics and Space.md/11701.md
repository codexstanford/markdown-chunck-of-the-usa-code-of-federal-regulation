###### ยง 417.219 Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analyses.
####### Data loss flight times.

(b)A flight safety analysis must establish the shortest elapsed thrusting time during which a launch vehicle can move from normal flight to a condition where the launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion extends to any protected area as a data loss flight time. The analysis must establish a data loss flight time for all times along the nominal trajectory from liftoff through that point during nominal flight when the minimum elapsed thrusting time is no greater than the time it would take for a normal vehicle to reach the overflight gate, or the planned safe flight state established under paragraph (c) of this section, whichever occurs earlier.
