###### Radio frequency sensitivity.

(l)This test must consist of a statistical firing series of electro-explosive device lot samples to determine the radio frequency no-fire energy level for the remainder of the lot. The firing series must determine the highest continuous radio frequency energy level to which the device can be subjected and not fire with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level. Any demonstrated radio frequency no-fire energy level that is less than the level used in the flight termination system design and analysis constitutes a test failure.
