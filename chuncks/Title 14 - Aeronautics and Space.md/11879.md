###### Risk management.

(c)The requirements for public risk management of ยง 417.205(a) apply to a flight safety limits analysis. When employing risk assessment, the analysis must establish flight safety limits that satisfy paragraph (b) of this section, account for the products of the debris risk analysis performed as required by section A417.25, and ensure that any risk to the public satisfies the public risk criteria of ยง 417.107(b). When employing hazard isolation, the analysis must establish flight safety limits in accordance with the following:

(1) The flight safety limits must account for the maximum deviation impact locations for the most wind sensitive debris fragment with a minimum of 11 ft-lbs of kinetic energy at impact.

(2) The maximum deviation impact location of the debris identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each trajectory time must account for the three-sigma impact location for the maximum deviation flight, and the launch day wind conditions that produce the maximum ballistic wind for that debris.

(3) The maximum deviation flight must account for the instantaneous impact point, of the debris identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section at breakup, that is closest to a protected area and the maximum ballistic wind directed from the breakup point toward that protected area.
