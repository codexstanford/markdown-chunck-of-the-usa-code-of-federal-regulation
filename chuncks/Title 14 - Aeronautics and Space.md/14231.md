(ii) An agency investigative report showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses;

(iii) The individual debtor's own financial statement executed under penalty of perjury reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses; or

(iv) An audited balance sheet of a corporate debtor.

(4) Reasons for credit data omissions. The credit data may be omitted if:

(i) A surety bond is available in an amount sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;

(ii) The forced sale value of the security available for application to the Government's claim is sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;

(iii) NASA wishes to liquidate loan collateral through judicial foreclosure but does not desire a deficiency judgment;

(iv) The debtor is in bankruptcy or receivership;

(v) The debtor's liability to the Government is fully covered by insurance, in which case NASA will furnish such information as it can develop concerning the identity and address of the insurer and the type and amount of insurance coverage; or

(vi) The status of the debtor is such that credit data is not normally available or cannot reasonably be obtained, for example, a unit of State or local government.
