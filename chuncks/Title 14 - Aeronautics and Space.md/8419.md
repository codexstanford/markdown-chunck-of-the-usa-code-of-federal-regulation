##### Appendix A to Part 152 - Contract and Labor Provisions
###### Contract termination.

(9)A breach of paragraphs [insert designation of 3 paragraphs corresponding to paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) of this paragraph] may be grounds for termination of the contract.

A contractor or subcontractor who has become liable for liquidated damages under the provision set out in paragraph I.G of this appendix and who claims that the amount administratively determined as liquidated damages under section 104(a) of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act is incorrect or that he violated inadvertently the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, notwithstanding the exercise of due care, may-

(1) If the amount determined is more than $100, apply to the Administrator for a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor that an appropriate adjustment be made or that he be relieved of liability for the liquidated damages; or

(2) If the amount determined is $100 or less, apply to the Administrator for an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages or for release from liability for the liquidated damages.

The Secretary of Labor corrects any wage determination included in any contract under this appendix whenever the wage determination contains clerical errors. A correction may be made at the Administrator's request or on the initiative of the Secretary of Labor.

When applicable by their terms, the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.20-5.32) interpreting the "fringe benefit provisions" of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to the contract provisions in this appendix.

A sponsor who is required to include in a construction contract the labor provisions required by this appendix shall require the contractor to comply with those provisions and shall cooperate with the FAA in effecting that compliance. For this purpose the sponsor shall-

(1) Keep, and preserve, the record described in paragraph IC for a 3-year period beginning on the date the contract is completed, each affidavit and payroll copy furnished by the contractor, and make those affidavits and copies available to the FAA, upon request, during that period;

(2) Have each of those affidavits and payrolls examined by its resident engineer (or any other of its employees or agents who is qualified to make the necessary determinations), as soon as possible after receiving it, to the extent necessary to determine whether the contractor is complying with the labor provisions required by this appendix and particularly with respect to whether the contractor's employees are correctly classified;

(3) Have investigations made during the performance of work under the contract, to the extent necessary to determine whether the contractor is complying with those labor provisions, including in the investigations, interviews with employees and examinations of payroll information at the work site by the sponsor's resident engineer (or any other of its employees or agents who is qualified to make the necessary determinations);

(4) Keep the appropriate FAA office fully advised of all examinations and investigations made under this appendix, all determinations made on the basis of those examinations and investigations, and all efforts made to obtain compliance with the labor provisions of the contract; and

(5) Give priority to complaints of alleged violations, and treat as confidential any written or oral statements made by any employee in connection with a complaint, and not disclose an employee's statement made in connection with a complaint to a contractor without the employee's consent.
