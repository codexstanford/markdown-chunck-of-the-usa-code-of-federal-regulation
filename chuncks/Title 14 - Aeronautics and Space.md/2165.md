M25.5

The effects of airplane component failures on FRM reliability must be assessed on an on-going basis. The applicant/holder must do the following:

(a) Demonstrate effective means to ensure collection of FRM reliability data. The means must provide data affecting FRM reliability, such as component failures.

(b) Unless alternative reporting procedures are approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office, as defined in part 26 of this subchapter, provide a report to the FAA every six months for the first five years after service introduction. After that period, continued reporting every six months may be replaced with other reliability tracking methods found acceptable to the FAA or eliminated if it is established that the reliability of the FRM meets, and will continue to meet, the exposure requirements of paragraph M25.1 of this appendix.

(c) Develop service instructions or revise the applicable airplane manual, according to a schedule approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office, as defined in part 26 of this subchapter, to correct any failures of the FRM that occur in service that could increase any fuel tank's Fleet Average Flammability Exposure to more than that required by paragraph M25.1 of this appendix.
