###### Effective date and duration.

17.These covenants shall become effective upon acceptance by the sponsor of an offer of Federal aid for the Project or any portion thereof, made by the FAA and shall constitute a part of the Grant Agreement thus formed. These covenants shall remain in full force and effect throughout the useful life of the facilities developed under this Project, but in any event not to exceed twenty (20) years from the date of said acceptance of an offer of Federal aid for the Project. However, these limitations on the duration of the covenants do not apply to the covenant against exclusive rights and real property acquired with Federal funds. Any breach of these covenants on the part of the sponsor may result in the suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant Federal assistance under, FAA administered programs, or such other action which may be necessary to enforce the rights of the United States under this agreement.
