####### ยง 29.923 Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.
######## Continuous OEI power run.

(2)For rotorcraft for which the use of continuous OEI power is requested, a run at continuous OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with continuous OEI torque must be conducted as follows: For each engine, in sequence, that engine must be inoperative and the remaining engines must be run for 1 hour.

(3) The number of periods prescribed in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this section may not be less than the number of engines, nor may it be less than two.

(l) [Reserved]

(m) Any components that are affected by maneuvering and gust loads must be investigated for the same flight conditions as are the main rotors, and their service lives must be determined by fatigue tests or by other acceptable methods. In addition, a level of safety equal to that of the main rotors must be provided for-

(1) Each component in the rotor drive system whose failure would cause an uncontrolled landing;

(2) Each component essential to the phasing of rotors on multirotor rotorcraft, or that furnishes a driving link for the essential control of rotors in autorotation; and

(3) Each component common to two or more engines on multiengine rotorcraft.
