###### Radio frequency system pre-flight test.

(1)All radio frequency systems must undergo a pre-flight test that satisfies all of the following:

(i) The test must demonstrate that the flight termination system antennas and associated radio frequency systems satisfy all their performance specifications once installed in their final flight configuration;

(ii) The test must measure the system's voltage standing wave ratio and demonstrate that any insertion losses are within the design limits;

(iii) The test must demonstrate that the radio frequency system, from each command control system transmitter antenna used for the first stage of flight to each command receiver satisfies all its performance specifications;

(iv) The test must occur no earlier than 90 days before flight; and

(v) The test must demonstrate the functions of each command receiver decoder and calibrate the automatic gain control signal strength curves, verify the threshold sensitivity for each command, and verify the operational bandwidth.
