#### Subpart F - Declassification and Downgrading
##### ยง 1203.604 Mandatory review for declassification.
###### Posted notice.

(2)If prompt remarking of large quantities would be unduly burdensome, the custodian may attach declassification, downgrading, or upgrading notices to the storage unit in lieu of the remarking action otherwise required. Each notice shall indicate the change, the authority for the action, the date of the action, and the storage units to which it applies. Items withdrawn from such storage units shall be promptly remarked. However, when information subject to a posted downgrading or declassification notice is withdrawn from one storage unit solely for transfer to another, or a storage unit containing such information is transferred from one place to another, the transfer may be made without remarking if the notice is attached to or remains with each shipment.
