The operating radio frequencies of all ground components must not vary by more than +/-10 KHz from the assigned frequency. Any one transmitter frequency must not vary more than +/-50 Hz in any one second period. The MLS angle/data and DME equipment must operate on one of the paired channels as shown in Table 1b.
