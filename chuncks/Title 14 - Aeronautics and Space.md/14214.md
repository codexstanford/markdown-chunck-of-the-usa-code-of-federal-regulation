#### Subpart 1261.4 - Collection of Civil Claims of the United States Arising Out of the Activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
##### ยง 1261.414 Compromise of claims.
###### Joint and several liability.

(i)When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, collection action will not be withheld against one such debtor until the other or others pay their proportionate shares. NASA will not attempt to allocate the burden of paying such claims as between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible. Care should be taken that a compromise agreement with one such debtor does not release the agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one such debtor shall not be considered a precedent or as morally binding in determining the amount which will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.
