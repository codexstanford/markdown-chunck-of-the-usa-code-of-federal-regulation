(c) When offering a ticket for purchase by a consumer, for passenger air transportation or for a tour (, a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, may not offer additional optional services in connection with air transportation, a tour, or tour component whereby the optional service is automatically added to the consumer's purchase if the consumer takes no other action, i.e., if the consumer does not opt out. The consumer must affirmatively "opt in" (, agree) to such a service and the fee for it before that fee is added to the total price for the air transportation-related purchase. The Department considers the use of "opt-out" provisions to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712.
