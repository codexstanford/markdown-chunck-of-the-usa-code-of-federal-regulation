###### Federal use of facilities.

26.All facilities of the Airport developed with Federal aid and all those usable for the landing and taking off of aircraft, will be available to the United States at all times, without charge, for use by government aircraft in common with other aircraft, except that if the use by government aircraft is substantial, a reasonable share, proportional to such use, of the cost of operating and maintaining facilities so used, may be charged. Unless otherwise determined by the FAA, or otherwise agreed to by the Sponsor and the using agency, substantial use of an airport by government aircraft will be considered to exist when operations of such aircraft are in excess of those which, in the opinion of the FAA, would unduly interfere with use of the landing area by other authorized aircraft, or during any calendar month that-

a. Five (5) or more government aircraft are regularly based at the airport or on land adjacent thereto; or

b. The total number of movements (counting each landing as a movement and each takeoff as a movement) of government aircraft is 300 or more, or the gross accumulative weight of government aircraft using the Airport (the total movements of government aircraft multiplied by gross certified weights of such aircraft) is in excess of five million pounds.
