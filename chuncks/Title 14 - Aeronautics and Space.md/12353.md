###### Interfaces.

(b)A qualification test of an ordnance interface must demonstrate the interface's reliability. This must include all of the following:

(1) The test must use a simulated flight configured interface and test hardware that duplicate the geometry and volume of the firing system used on the launch vehicle; and

(2) The test must account for performance variability due to manufacturing and workmanship tolerances such as minimum gap, maximum gap, and axial and angular offset.
