###### Airport Hazards.

23.Insofar as it is within its power and reasonable, the Sponsor will, either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations, prevent the construction, erection, alteration, or growth of any structure, tree, or other object in the approach areas of the runways of the Airport, which would constitute an airport hazard.

In addition, the Sponsor will not erect or permit the erection of any permanent structure or facility which would interfere materially with the use, operation, or future development of the Airport, in any portion of a runway approach area in which the Sponsor has acquired, or hereafter acquires, property interests permitting it to so control the use made of the surface of the land.
