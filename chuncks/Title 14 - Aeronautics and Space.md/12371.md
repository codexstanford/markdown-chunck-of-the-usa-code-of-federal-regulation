###### Final open-loop test of a secure high-alphabet command destruct system.

(7)Any flight termination system that uses a secure high-alphabet command receiver decoder must undergo a final open-loop radio frequency test no earlier than 60 minutes before flight, to validate the entire radio frequency command destruct link from the command control transmitting system to launch vehicle antenna. The test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The flight termination system must undergo the test in its final flight configuration with all flight destruct initiators connected and in a safe condition;

(ii) Flight batteries must power all receiver decoders and other electronic components. The test must account for any warm-up time needed for reliable operation of the electronic components;

(iii) The test must exercise each command receiver decoder's self-test function including pilot or check tone using the command control system transmitters in their flight configuration;

(iv) The test must demonstrate that each receiver decoder is operational and compatible with the command control transmitter system; and

(v) Following successful completion of the open-loop test, if any command receiver decoder is turned off or the transmitter system fails to continuously transmit the pilot or check tone, the flight termination system must undergo the final open-loop test again before flight.
