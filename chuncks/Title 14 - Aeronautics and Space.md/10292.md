####### Form and contents.

(b)Unless made during a hearing, motions shall be made in writing in conformity with §§ 302.3 and 302.4, shall state their grounds and the relief or order sought, and shall be accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence desired to be relied upon. Motions made during hearings, answers to them, and rulings on them, may be made orally on the record unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. Written motions shall be filed as separate documents, and shall not be incorporated in any other documents, except where incorporation of a motion in another document is specifically authorized by the Department, or where a document is filed that requests alternative forms of relief and one of these alternative requests is properly to be made by motion. In these instances the document filed shall be appropriately titled and identified to indicate that it incorporates a motion; otherwise, the motion will be disregarded.
