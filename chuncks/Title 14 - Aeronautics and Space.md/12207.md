###### Silver-zinc battery status-of-health tests.,500-volt insulation.

(c)(1)A 500-volt insulation test of a silver-zinc battery must satisfy the status-of-health test requirements of section E417.3(f). The test must measure insulation resistance between mutually insulated pin-to-pin and pin-to-case points using a minimum 500-volt workmanship voltage prior to connecting any battery harness to the cells. The test must measure the continuity of the battery harness after completion of all wiring, but before battery activation to demonstrate that the insulation and continuity resistances satisfy their performance specifications.
