(1) The radar wavelength is greater than or equal to 5 cm;

(2) A reflectivity measurement is due to a meteorological target;

(3) The spatial accuracy and resolution of a reflectivity measurement is 1 kilometer or better;

(4) Any attenuation caused by intervening precipitation or by an accumulation of water or ice on the radome is less than or equal to 1 dBZ; and

(5) A reflectivity measurement contains no portion of the cone of silence above the radar antenna, nor any portion of any sector that is blocked out for payload safety reasons.
