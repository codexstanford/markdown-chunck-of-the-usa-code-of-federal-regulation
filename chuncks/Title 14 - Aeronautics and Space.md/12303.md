###### All-fire energy level.

(q)An all-fire energy level test must consist of a statistical firing series of exploding bridgewire lot samples to determine the lowest electrical energy level at which the exploding bridgewire will fire with a reliability of 0.999 with a 95% confidence level when subjected to a current pulse simulating the firing unit output waveform and impedance characteristics. Each exploding bridgewire sample must be in its flight configuration, and must possess any internal safety devices, such as a spark gap, employed in the flight configuration. The test must demonstrate that the all-fire energy level does not exceed the all-fire energy level used in the flight termination system design and analysis.
