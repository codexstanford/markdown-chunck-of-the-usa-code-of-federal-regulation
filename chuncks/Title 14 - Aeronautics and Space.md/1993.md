###### Calorimeter.

(3)

(i) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a (0-15.0 BTU/ft-sec. 0-17.0 W/cm) calorimeter, accurate +/-3%, mounted in a 6-inch by 12-inch (152 by 305 mm) by-inch (19 mm) thick calcium silicate insulating board which is attached to a steel angle bracket for placement in the test stand during burner calibration, as shown in Figure 4.

(ii) Because crumbling of the insulating board with service can result in misalignment of the calorimeter, the calorimeter must be monitored and the mounting shimmed, as necessary, to ensure that the calorimeter face is flush with the exposed plane of the insulating board in a plane parallel to the exit of the test burner cone.
