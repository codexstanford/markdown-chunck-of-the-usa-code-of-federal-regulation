####### ยง 25.629 Aeroelastic stability requirements.
######## Aeroelastic stability envelopes.

(b)The airplane must be designed to be free from aeroelastic instability for all configurations and design conditions within the aeroelastic stability envelopes as follows:

(1) For normal conditions without failures, malfunctions, or adverse conditions, all combinations of altitudes and speeds encompassed by the V/Mversus altitude envelope enlarged at all points by an increase of 15 percent in equivalent airspeed at both constant Mach number and constant altitude. In addition, a proper margin of stability must exist at all speeds up to V/Mand, there must be no large and rapid reduction in stability as V/Mis approached. The enlarged envelope may be limited to Mach 1.0 when Mis less than 1.0 at all design altitudes, and

(2) For the conditions described in ยง 25.629(d) below, for all approved altitudes, any airspeed up to the greater airspeed defined by;

(i) The V/Menvelope determined by ยง 25.335(b); or,

(ii) An altitude-airspeed envelope defined by a 15 percent increase in equivalent airspeed above Vat constant altitude, from sea level to the altitude of the intersection of 1.15 Vwith the extension of the constant cruise Mach number line, M, then a linear variation in equivalent airspeed to M+ .05 at the altitude of the lowest V/Mintersection; then, at higher altitudes, up to the maximum flight altitude, the boundary defined by a .05 Mach increase in Mat constant altitude.
