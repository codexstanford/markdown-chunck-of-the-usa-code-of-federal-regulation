(ii) Exceeding//or the structural limitations; and

(iii) Buffeting that would impair the pilot's ability to read the instruments or control the airplane for recovery.

(3) With the airplane trimmed at any speed up to V/M, there must be no reversal of the response to control input about any axis at any speed up to V/M. Any tendency to pitch, roll, or yaw must be mild and readily controllable, using normal piloting techniques. When the airplane is trimmed at V/M, the slope of the elevator control force versus speed curve need not be stable at speeds greater than V/M, but there must be a push force at all speeds up to V/Mand there must be no sudden or excessive reduction of elevator control force as V/Mis reached.

(4) Adequate roll capability to assure a prompt recovery from a lateral upset condition must be available at any speed up to V/M.

(5) With the airplane trimmed at V/M, extension of the speedbrakes over the available range of movements of the pilot's control, at all speeds above V/M, but not so high that V/Mwould be exceeded during the maneuver, must not result in:

(i) An excessive positive load factor when the pilot does not take action to counteract the effects of extension;

(ii) Buffeting that would impair the pilot's ability to read the instruments or control the airplane for recovery; or

(iii) A nose down pitching moment, unless it is small.
