## Chapter V - National Aeronautics and Space Administration
### PART 1262 - EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT IN AGENCY PROCEEDINGS
#### Subpart 1262.1 - General Provisions
##### ยง 1262.103 Proceedings covered.
###### et seq.,

(3) Any hearing conducted under Chapter 38 of Title 31 (31 U.S.C. 3801,as amended); and

(4) Adjudications under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb).

(b) The Act does not apply to:

(1) Any proceeding in which this Agency may prescribe a lawful present or future rate;

(2) Proceedings to grant or renew licenses (note, however, that proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise adversary adjudications); and

(3) Proceedings which are covered by a compromise or settlement agreement, unless specifically consented to in such agreement.

(c) NASA may also designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The Agency's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filling of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.

(d) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
