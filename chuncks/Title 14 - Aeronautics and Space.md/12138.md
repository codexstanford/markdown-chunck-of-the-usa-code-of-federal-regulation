###### Acceptance random vibration.

(b)An acceptance random vibration test must demonstrate that a component satisfies all its performance specifications when exposed to the acceptance random vibration environment as follows:

(1) The acceptance random vibration environment must equal or exceed the greater of the maximum predicted random vibration level or the minimum workmanship acceptance test level of table E417.13-1, for all frequencies from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz, in each of three mutually perpendicular axes.

(2) For each axis, the vibration must last the greater of three times the maximum predicted duration or a minimum workmanship screening level of 60 seconds.

(3) For a component sample that undergoes qualification testing and must experience the acceptance environment before it experiences the qualification environment, such as a command receiver decoder, the test must use the same configuration and methods for the acceptance and qualification random vibration environments. An acceptance random vibration test of a flight component sample must use a configuration and method that is representative of the component's qualification tests to ensure that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied.

(4) For any component that is mounted on one or more vibration or shock isolators during flight, the component must undergo the acceptance random vibration test in the same isolator-mounted configuration or hard-mounted configuration as the component's qualification random vibration test as follows:

(i) Any hard-mounted acceptance random vibration test must subject the component to an acceptance random vibration environment that:

(A) Accounts for the isolator attenuation and amplification due to the maximum predicted operating random vibration environment, including any thermal effects and acceleration pre-load performance variability, and adds a 1.5 dB margin to account for any isolator attenuation variability; and

(B) Is no less than the minimum workmanship screening acceptance random vibration level of table E417.13-1.

(ii) Any isolator-mounted acceptance random vibration test must:

(A) Use an isolator or isolators that passed the tests required by section E417.35;

(B) Have an input to each isolator of no less than the required acceptance random vibration environment of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section; and

(C) Subject the component to no less than the minimum workmanship screening acceptance random vibration level of table E417.13-1. If the isolator or isolators prevent the component from experiencing the minimum workmanship level, the component must undergo a hard-mount test that subjects the component to the workmanship level.

(5) If the duration of the acceptance random vibration environment leaves insufficient time to complete any required performance verification test while the component is subjected to the full acceptance environment, the test must continue at no lower than 6 dB below the acceptance environment. The test need only continue for the additional time needed to complete the performance verification test.

(6) The test must continuously monitor all performance and status-of-health parameters with any electrical component at its nominal operating voltage. This monitoring must have a sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation.
