(i) The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or

(ii) The maximum value shown during the type tests;

(2) The maximum allowable manifold pressure (for reciprocating engines);

(3) The maximum allowable turbine inlet or turbine outlet gas temperature (for turbine engines);

(4) The maximum allowable power or torque for each engine, considering the power input limitations of the transmission with all engines operating;

(5) The maximum allowable power or torque for each engine considering the power input limitations of the transmission with one engine inoperative;

(6) The time limit for the use of the power corresponding to the limitations established in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section; and
