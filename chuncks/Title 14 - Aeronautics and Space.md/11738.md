###### ยง 417.305 Command control system testing.
####### Independent radio frequency open loop verification tests.

(4)A command control system must undergo an open loop end-to-end verification test for each launch as close to the planned flight as operationally feasible and after any modification to the system or break in the system configuration. The test must:

(i) Verify the performance of each element of the system from the flight safety system displays and controls to each command transmitter site;

(ii) Measure all system performance parameters received and transmitted using measuring equipment that does not physically interface with any elements of the operational command control system;

(iii) Verify the performance of each flight safety system display and control and remote command transmitter site combination by repeating all measurements for each combination, for all strings and all operational configurations of cross-strapped equipment; and

(iv) Verify that all critical command control system performance parameters satisfy all their performance specifications. These parameters must include:

(A) Transmitter power output;

(B) Center frequency stability;

(C) Tone deviation;

(D) Tone frequency;

(E) Message timing;

(F) Status of each communication circuit between the flight safety system display and controls and any supporting command transmitter sites;

(G) Status agreement between the flight safety system display and controls and each and any supporting command transmitter sites;

(H) Fail-over conditions;

(I) Tone balance; and

(J) Time delay from initiation of a command at each flight safety system control to transmitter output of the command signal.
