##### Appendix A to Part 417 - Flight Safety Analysis Methodologies and Products for a Launch Vehicle Flown With a Flight Safety System
###### General.

(a)A flight safety analysis must include a far field blast overpressure effects hazard analysis that satisfies the requirements of ยง 417.229. This section applies to the computation of far field blast overpressure effects from the proposed flight of a launch vehicle as required by ยง 417.229 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by ยง 417.203(e). The analysis must account for distant focus overpressure and any overpressure enhancement to establish the potential for broken windows due to peak incident overpressures below 1.0 psi and related casualties due to falling or projected glass shards. The analysis must employ either paragraph (b) of this section or the risk analysis of paragraph (c) of this section.
