###### Thermal performance.

(j)A thermal performance test must demonstrate that the receiver decoder satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to operating and workmanship thermal environments. The receiver decoder must undergo the thermal performance test during a thermal cycle test and during a thermal vacuum test. The receiver decoder must undergo the thermal performance test at its low and high operating voltage while the receiver decoder is at the high and low temperatures during the first, middle, and last thermal cycles. The thermal performance test at each high and low temperature must include each of the following sub-tests of this section:

(1) Response time, paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

(2) Input current, paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

(3) Output functions, paragraph (c)(4) of this section;

(4) Decoder channel deviation, paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section;

(5) Operational bandwidth, paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section;

(6) Radio frequency dynamic range, paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section;

(7) Capture ratio, paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section;

(8) Radio frequency monitor, paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section;

(9) Message timing, paragraph (e)(2)(xi) of this section;

(10) Check tone, paragraph (e)(2)(xii) of this section; and

(11) Self test, paragraph (e)(2)(xiii) of this section.
