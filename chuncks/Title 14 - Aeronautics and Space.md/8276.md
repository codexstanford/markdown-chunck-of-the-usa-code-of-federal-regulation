(ii) Interfere with the use of the airport for public airport purposes; or

(iii) Make it impossible for the sponsor to carry out the agreements and convenants in its grant application;

(3) In the case of an off-airport area, title or an agreement, easement, leasehold or other right or property interest that, in the Administrator's opinion, provides reasonable assurance that the sponsor will not be deprived of its right to use the land for the intended purpose during the period necessary to meet the requirements of the grant agreement; or

(4) In the case of a runway clear zone, an easement or a covenant running with the land, giving the airport operator or owner enough control to rid the clear zone of all airport hazards and prevent the creation of future airport hazards.
