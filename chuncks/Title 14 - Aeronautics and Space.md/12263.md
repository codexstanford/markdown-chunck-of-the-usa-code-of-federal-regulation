###### Thermal performance.

(f)A thermal performance test must demonstrate that a safe-and-arm device satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to operating and workmanship thermal environments. This demonstration must include all of the following:

(1) The safe-and-arm device must undergo the test while subjected to each required thermal environment;

(2) The test must continuously monitor the bridgewire continuity with the safe-and-arm device in its arm position to detect each and any variation in amplitude. Any variation in amplitude constitutes a test failure;

(3) The test must measure the bridgewire resistance for the first and last thermal cycle during the high and low temperature dwell times to demonstrate that the bridgewire resistance satisfies the manufacturer specification;

(4) The test must subject the safe-and-arm device to five safe-and-arm cycles and measure the bridgewire continuity during each cycle to demonstrate that the continuity is consistent; and

(5) The test must measure the safe-and-arm cycle time to demonstrate that it satisfies the manufacturer specification.
