###### Penetration margin.

(c)A penetration margin test must demonstrate a destruct charge's ability to accomplish its intended flight termination function, such as to destroy the pressure integrity of any solid propellant stage or motor or rupture any propellant tank. This must include penetrating no less than 150% of the thickness of the target material. Each test must also demonstrate that the charge is in-family by correlating equivalent penetration depth into a witness plate and comparing the results from each test.
