###### ยง 417.309 Flight safety system analysis.
####### Radio frequency link.

(f)(1) The flight safety system must undergo a radio frequency link analysis to demonstrate that it satisfies the required 12-dB margin for nominal system performance and 6-dB margin for worst-case system performance.

(2) When demonstrating the 12-dB margin, each link analysis must account for the following nominal system performance and attenuation factors:

(i) Path losses due to plume or flame attenuation;

(ii) Vehicle trajectory;

(iii) Ground system and airborne system radio frequency characteristics; and

(iv) The antenna gain value that ensures that the margin is satisfied over 95% of the antenna radiation sphere surrounding the launch vehicle.

(3) When demonstrating the 6-dB margin, each link analysis must account for the following worst-case system performance and attenuation factors:

(i) The system performance and attenuation factors of paragraph (f)(2) of this section;

(ii) The command transmitter failover criteria of ยง 417.303(g) including the lowest output power provided by the transmitter system;

(iii) Worst-case power loss due to antenna pointing inaccuracies; and

(iv) Any other attenuation factors.
