###### Open-loop test of a non-secure command destruct system.

(3)For each flight attempt, any flight termination system that uses a non-secure command receiver decoder must undergo an open-loop radio frequency test, no earlier than 60 minutes before the start of the launch window, to validate the entire radio frequency command destruct link. For each flight attempt, the flight safety system must undergo the test again after any break or change in the system configuration. The test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The system must undergo the test with all flight termination system ordnance initiation devices in a safe condition;

(ii) Flight batteries must power all receiver decoders and other electronic components. The test must account for any warm-up time needed to ensure the reliable operation of electronic components;

(iii) The test must exercise the command receiver decoder arm function, including the pilot or check tone, using a command control transmitter in its flight configuration;

(iv) The test must demonstrate that each receiver decoder is operational and is compatible with the command control transmitter system; and

(v) Following successful completion of the open-loop test, if any receiver decoder is turned off or the transmitter system fails to continuously transmit the pilot or check tone, the flight termination system must undergo the open-loop test again before flight.
