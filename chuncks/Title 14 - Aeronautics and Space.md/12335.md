###### Primer charge firing tests.,General.

(f)(1)Each firing test of a primer charge must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must demonstrate that the primer charge, including any booster charge or ordnance delay as an integral unit, satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to all qualification stress conditions;

(ii) The number of samples that the test must fire and the test conditions, including impact energy and temperature, must satisfy each table of this section;

(iii) Before initiation, each component sample must experience the required temperature for enough time to achieve thermal equilibrium;

(iv) The test must use a firing pin and configuration that is representative of the flight configuration; and

(v) The test must measure ordnance output using a measuring device, such as a swell cap or dent block, to demonstrate that the ordnance output satisfies all its performance specifications.
