###### High voltage output.

(d)An exploding bridgewire firing unit's high voltage discharge circuit must satisfy all of the following:

(1) An exploding bridgewire firing unit must include circuits for capacitor charging, bleeding, charge interruption, and triggering;

(2) An exploding bridgewire firing unit must have a single fault tolerant capacitor discharge capability;

(3) An exploding bridgewire firing unit must deliver a voltage to the exploding bridgewire that is no less than 50% greater than the exploding bridgewire's minimum all-fire voltage, not including transmission losses, at the unit's worst-case high and low arming voltages;

(4) The design of an exploding bridgewire firing unit must prevent corona and arcing on internal and external high voltage circuitry;

(5) An exploding bridgewire firing unit must satisfy all its performance specifications at the worst-case high and low arm voltages that could be delivered during flight; and

(6) Any high energy trigger circuit used to initiate exploding bridgewire firing unit's main firing capacitor must deliver an output signal of no less than a 50% voltage margin above the nominal voltage threshold level.
