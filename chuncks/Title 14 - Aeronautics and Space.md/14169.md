###### Demand on carrier, contractor, warehouse owner/operator, or insurer.

(b)When it appears that property has been damaged or lost under circumstances in which a carrier, warehouse owner/operator, contractor or insurer may be responsible, the claimant shall make a written demand on such party, either before or after submitting a claim against NASA. The Administrator or designee, if requested, will assist in making demand on the third party. No such demand need be made if, in the opinion of the Administrator or designee, it would be impracticable or any recovery would be insignificant, or if circumstances preclude the claimant from making timely demand.
