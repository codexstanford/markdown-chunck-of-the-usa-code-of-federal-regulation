###### Output monitoring.

(e)(1) An output monitoring test must measure the voltage of each high voltage capacitor and the arm power to a firing unit and demonstrate that it satisfies all its performance specifications.

(2) An output monitoring test conducted while the firing unit is subjected to an operating environment, must continuously monitor the voltage of each high voltage capacitor and the arm power to the firing unit to detect any variation in amplitude. Any amplitude variation constitutes a test failure. The monitoring must use a sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation.
