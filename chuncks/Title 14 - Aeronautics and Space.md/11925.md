###### Methodology for computing ship hazard areas in the vicinity of each planned water impact location.

(d)A launch operator must compute a ship hazard area in the vicinity of each planned impact location as required by the following:

(1) The analysis must calculate a three-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the three-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.

(2) Taking the three-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10 nm longer than the major and minor axes of the three-sigma dispersion ellipse.
