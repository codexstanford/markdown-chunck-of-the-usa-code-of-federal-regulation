####### ยง 27.621 Casting factors.
######## Critical castings.

(c)For each casting whose failure would preclude continued safe flight and landing of the rotorcraft or result in serious injury to any occupant, the following apply:

(1) Each critical casting must-

(i) Have a casting factor of not less than 1.25; and

(ii) Receive 100 percent inspection by visual, radiographic, and magnetic particle (for ferromagnetic materials) or penetrant (for nonferromagnetic materials) inspection methods or approved equivalent inspection methods.

(2) For each critical casting with a casting factor less than 1.50, three sample castings must be static tested and shown to meet-

(i) The strength requirements of ยง 27.305 at an ultimate load corresponding to a casting factor of 1.25; and

(ii) The deformation requirements of ยง 27.305 at a load of 1.15 times the limit load.
