###### D. Apprentices.

Apprentices will be permitted to work as such only when they are registered, individually, under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State apprenticeship agency which is recognized by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor; or, if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered as above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the [insert sponsor's name] written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as of the appropriate ratios and wage rates, for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work (29 CFR 5.5(a)(4)).
