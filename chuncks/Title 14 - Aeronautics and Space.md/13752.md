###### March-in rights.

(b)For any invention for which waiver of rights has been granted under this subpart, NASA has the same right as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210, with the procedures set forth in ยง 1245.117 and 37 CFR 401.6, to require the contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of the invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, NASA has the right to grant such a license itself if NASA determines that:

(1) Such action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in such field of use;

(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or their licensees;

(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees; or

(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by the "Preference for United States industry" has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
