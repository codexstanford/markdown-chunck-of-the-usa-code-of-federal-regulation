###### ยง 417.409 System hazard controls.
####### Pressure vessels and pressurized systems.

(c)A launch operator must apply the following hazard controls to a pressurized flight or ground pressure vessel, component, or systems:

(1) Qualified and certified personnel, as defined in ยง 417.105, must test each pressure vessel, component, or system upon installation and before being placed into service, and periodically inspect to ensure that no rejectable discontinuities exists;

(2) Safety factors applied in the design of a pressure vessel, component, or system must account for static and dynamic loads, environmental stresses, and expected wear;

(3) Pressurized system flow-paths, except for pressure relief and emergency venting, must be single fault tolerant to causing pressure ruptures and material releases during launch processing; and

(4) Provide pressure relief and emergency venting capability to protect against pressure ruptures. Pressure relief devices must provide the flow rate necessary to prevent a rupture in the event a pressure vessel is exposed to fire.
