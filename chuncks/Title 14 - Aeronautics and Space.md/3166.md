######## Category B.

(b)For each category B rotorcraft, the Rotorcraft Flight Manual must contain-

(1) The takeoff distance and the climbout speed together with the pertinent information defining the flight path with respect to autorotative landing if an engine fails, including the calculated effects of altitude and temperature;

(2) The steady rates of climb and in-ground-effect hovering ceiling, together with the corresponding airspeeds and other pertinent information, including the calculated effects of altitude and temperature;

(3) The landing distance, appropriate airspeed, and type of landing surface, together with all pertinent information that might affect this distance, including the effects of weight, altitude, and temperature;

(4) The maximum safe wind for operation near the ground;

(5) The airspeed calibrations;

(6) The height-velocity envelope except for rotorcraft incorporating this as an operating limitation;

(7) Glide distance as a function of altitude when autorotating at the speeds and conditions for minimum rate of descent and best glide angle, as determined in ยง 29.71;

(8) Out-of-ground effect hover performance determined under ยง 29.49 and the maximum safe wind demonstrated under the ambient conditions for data presented. In addition, the maximum weight for each altitude and temperature condition at which the rotorcraft can safely hover out-of-ground-effect in winds of not less than 17 knots from all azimuths. These data must be clearly referenced to the appropriate hover charts; and

(9) Any additional performance data necessary for the application of any operating rule in this chapter.
