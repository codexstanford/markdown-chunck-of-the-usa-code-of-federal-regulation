##### Appendix G to Part 121 - Doppler Radar and Inertial Navigation System (INS): Request for Evaluation; Equipment and Equipment Installation; Training Program; Equipment Accuracy and Reliability; Evaluation Program
###### Equipment accuracy and reliability.

6.(a) Each Inertial Navigation System must meet the following accuracy requirements, as appropriate:

(1) For flights up to 10 hours' duration, no greater than 2 nautical miles per hour of circular error on 95 percent of system flights completed is permitted.

(2) For flights over 10 hours' duration, a tolerance of +/-20 miles cross-track and +/-25 miles along-track on 95 percent of system flights completed is permitted.

(b) Compass heading information to the Doppler Radar must be maintained to an accuracy of +/-1&#xB0; and total system deviations must not exceed 2&#xB0;. When free gyro techniques are used, procedures shall be utilized to ensure that an equivalent level of heading accuracy and total system deviation is attained.

(c) Each Doppler Radar System must meet accuracy requirements of +/-20 miles cross-track and +/-25 miles along-track for 95 percent of the system flights completed. Updating is permitted.
