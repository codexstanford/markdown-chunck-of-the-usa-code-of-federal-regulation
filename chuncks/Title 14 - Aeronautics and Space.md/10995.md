####### Decision on petition for hearing.

(2)The petition shall be granted if the petitioner makes a clear and convincing showing that granting the petition is in the public interest. Factors in determining whether a petition is in the public interest include, but are not limited to:

(i) Whether the proposed rule depends on conclusions concerning one or more specific scientific, technical, economic, or other factual issues that are genuinely in dispute or that may not satisfy the requirements of the Information Quality Act;

(ii) Whether the ordinary public comment process is unlikely to provide an adequate examination of the issues to permit a fully informed judgment;

(iii) Whether the resolution of the disputed factual issues would likely have a material effect on the costs and benefits of the proposed rule;

(iv) Whether the requested hearing would advance the consideration of the proposed rule and the General Counsel's ability to make the rulemaking determinations required by this section; and

(v) Whether the hearing would unreasonably delay completion of the rulemaking.
