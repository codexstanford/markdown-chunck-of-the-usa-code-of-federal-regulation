###### ยง 171.313 Azimuth performance requirements.
####### Siting requirements.

(b)The approach azimuth antenna system must, except as allowed in paragraph (c) of this section:

(1) Be located on the extension of the centerline of the runway beyond the stop end;

(2) Be adjusted so that the zero degree azimuth plane will be a vertical plane which contains the centerline of the runway served;

(3) Have the minimum height necessary to comply with the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section;

(4) Be located at a distance from the stop end of the runway that is consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;

(5) Not obscure any light of an approach lighting system; and

(6) Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 300 meter (1,000 feet) light bar.

(c) On runways where limited terrain prevents the azimuth antenna from being positioned on the runway centerline extended, and the cost of the land fill or a tall tower antenna support is prohibitive, the azimuth antenna may be offset.
