###### ยง 417.309 Flight safety system analysis.
####### Single failure point.

(c)A command control system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates that the system satisfies the fault tolerance requirements of ยง 417.303(d). A flight termination system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates that the system satisfies the fault tolerance requirements of section D417.5(b). Each analysis must:

(1) Follow a standard industry methodology such as a fault tree analysis or a failure modes effects and criticality analysis;

(2) Identify all possible failure modes and undesired events, their probability of occurrence, and their effects on system performance;

(3) Identify single point failure modes;

(4) Identify areas of design where redundancy is required and account for any failure mode where a component and its backup could fail at the same time due to a single cause;

(5) Identify functions, including redundancy, which are not or cannot be tested;

(6) Account for any potential system failures due to hardware, software, test equipment, or procedural or human errors;

(7) Account for any single failure point on another system that could disable a command control system or flight termination system, such as any launch vehicle system that could trigger safing of a flight termination system; and

(8) Provide input to the reliability analysis of paragraph (b) of this section.
