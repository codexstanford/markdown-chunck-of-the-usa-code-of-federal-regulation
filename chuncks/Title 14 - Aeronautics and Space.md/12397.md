###### Electric field measurement.

(c)A launch operator who measures an electric field to comply with this appendix must-

(1) Employ a ground-based field mill,

(2) Use only the one-minute arithmetic average of the instantaneous readings from that field mill,

(3) Ensure that all field mills are calibrated so that the polarity of the electric field measurements is the same as the polarity of a voltage placed on a test plate above the sensor,

(4) Ensure that the altitude of the flight path of the launch vehicle is equal to or less than 20 kilometers (66 thousand feet) everywhere above a horizontal circle of 5 nautical miles centered on the field mill being used,

(5) Use only direct measurements from a field mill, and

(6) Not interpolate based on electric-field contours.
