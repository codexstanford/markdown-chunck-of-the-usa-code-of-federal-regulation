###### Toxic hazard areas for launch processing.

(h)A launch operator, having determined the toxic hazard distance for the toxic concentration threshold for each toxic propellant involved in a process using either a worst-case release scenario or a worst-case alternative release scenario, must determine the toxic hazard area for the process as a circle centered at the potential release point with a radius equal to the greatest toxic hazard distance for the toxic propellants involved in the process. A launch operator does not have to satisfy this section if:

(1) There are no populated areas contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area; and

(2) There is no member of the public present within the toxic hazard area during the process.
