(2)A party may object to a request for admission. The objection must be in writing and signed by the party or the party's attorney or representative of record, and must state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the truth of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or admit the truth of the matter, the party must show that the party has made reasonable inquiry into the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. If an administrative law judge determines that a response does not comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is insufficient, the matter is admitted.
