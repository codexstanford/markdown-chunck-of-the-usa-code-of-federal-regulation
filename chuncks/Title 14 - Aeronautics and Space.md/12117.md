###### Salt fog.

(h)For a component that will be exposed to salt fog, a salt fog test or analysis must demonstrate that the component satisfies all its performance specifications after being subjected to the effects of a moist, salt-laden atmosphere. The test or analysis must demonstrate the ability of all externally exposed surfaces to withstand a salt-fog environment. The test or analysis must demonstrate the ability of each internal part of a component to withstand a salt-fog environment unless the component is environmentally sealed, and acceptance testing verifies that the seal works.
