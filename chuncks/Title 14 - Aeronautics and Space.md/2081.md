###### Calorimeter mounting.

(iii)Mount the calorimeter in a 6- by 12- +/-0.125 inch (152- by 305- +/-3 mm) by 0.75 +/-0.125 inch (19 mm +/-3 mm) thick insulating block which is attached to the heat flux calibration rig during calibration (figure 4). Monitor the insulating block for deterioration and replace it when necessary. Adjust the mounting as necessary to ensure that the calorimeter face is parallel to the exit plane of the test burner cone.
