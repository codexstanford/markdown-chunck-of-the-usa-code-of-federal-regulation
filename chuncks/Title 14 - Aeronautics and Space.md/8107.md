### Subchapter I - Airports
#### PART 150 - AIRPORT NOISE COMPATIBILITY PLANNING
##### Appendix A to Part 150 - Noise Exposure Maps

(a) This appendix establishes a uniform methodology for the development and preparation of airport noise exposure maps. That methodology includes a single system of measuring noise at airports for which there is a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reactions of people to noise along with a separate single system for determining the exposure of individuals to noise. It also identifies land uses which, for the purpose of this part are considered to be compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise around airports.

(b) This appendix provides for the use of the FAA's Integrated Noise Model (INM) or an FAA approved equivalent, for developing standardized noise exposure maps and predicting noise impacts. Noise monitoring may be utilized by airport operators for data acquisition and data refinement, but is not required by this part for the development of noise exposure maps or airport noise compatibility programs. Whenever noise monitoring is used, under this part, it should be accomplished in accordance with Sec. A150.5 of this appendix.
