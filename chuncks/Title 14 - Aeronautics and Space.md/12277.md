###### All-fire energy level.

(n)This test must consist of a statistical firing series of electro-explosive device lot samples to determine the all-fire energy level for the remainder of the lot. This firing series must determine the lowest electrical energy level at which the device will fire with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level when subjected to a current pulse that simulates the launch vehicle flight termination system firing characteristics. Any demonstrated all-fire energy level that exceeds the all-fire energy level used in the flight termination system design and analysis constitutes a test failure.
