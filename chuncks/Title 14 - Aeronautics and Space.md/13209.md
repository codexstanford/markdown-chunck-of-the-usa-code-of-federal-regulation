### PART 1203b - SECURITY PROGRAMS; ARREST AUTHORITY AND USE OF FORCE BY NASA SECURITY FORCE PERSONNEL
#### ยง 1203b.105 Use of non-deadly physical force when making an arrest.

When a security force personnel has the right to make an arrest, as discussed in ยง 1203b.103, the officer may use only that non-deadly physical force which is reasonable and necessary to apprehend and arrest the offender; to prevent the escape of the offender; or to defend himself/herself or a third person from what the security force officer reasonably believes to be the use or threat of imminent use of non-deadly physical force by the offender. Verbal abuse alone by the offender cannot be the basis under any circumstances for use of non-deadly physical force by a security force officer.
