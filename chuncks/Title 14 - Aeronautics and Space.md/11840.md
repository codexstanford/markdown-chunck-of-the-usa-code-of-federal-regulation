###### Velocity turn angle graphs.

(i)A launch operator must file a velocity turn angle graph for each malfunction start time. For each velocity turn angle graph, the ordinate axis must represent the total angle turned by the velocity vector, and the abscissa axis must represent the time duration of the turn and must show increments not to exceed one second. The series of tumble turns must include the envelope of all tumble turn curves. The tumble turn envelope must represent the tumble turn capability for all possible constant thrust vector offset angles. Each tumble turn curve selected to define the envelope must appear on the same graph as the envelope. A launch operator must file a series of trim turn curves for representative values of thrust vector offset. The series of trim turn curves must include the maximum rate trim turn. Figure A417.9-1 depicts an example family of tumble turn curves and the tumble turn velocity vector envelope.
