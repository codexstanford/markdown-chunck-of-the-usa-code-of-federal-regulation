###### Detonation flier plate ordnance transfer systems.

(c)A qualification test of a detonation flier plate ordnance transfer system composed of any component that has a charge or initiates a charge such as; electro-explosive devices, exploding bridgewires, ordnance delays, explosive transfer systems, destruct charges, and percussion-activated devices; must demonstrate the system's reliability using one of the following:

(1) A statistical firing series that varies critical performance parameters, including gap and axial and angular alignment, to ensure that ordnance initiation occurs across each flight configured interface with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level;

(2) Firing 2994 flight units in a flight representative configuration to demonstrate that ordnance initiation occurs across each flight configured interface with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level; or

(3) Firing all of the following units to demonstrate a gap margin that ensures ordnance initiation:

(i) Five units at four times the combined maximum system gap;

(ii) Five units at four times the combined maximum system axial misalignment;

(iii) Five units at four times the combined maximum system angular misalignment; and

(iv) Five units at 50% of the combined minimum system gap.
