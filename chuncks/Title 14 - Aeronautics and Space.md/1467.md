####### ยง 25.629 Aeroelastic stability requirements.
######## Flight flutter testing.

(e)Full scale flight flutter tests at speeds up to V/Mmust be conducted for new type designs and for modifications to a type design unless the modifications have been shown to have an insignificant effect on the aeroelastic stability. These tests must demonstrate that the airplane has a proper margin of damping at all speeds up to V/M, and that there is no large and rapid reduction in damping as V/M, is approached. If a failure, malfunction, or adverse condition is simulated during flight test in showing compliance with paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum speed investigated need not exceed V/Mif it is shown, by correlation of the flight test data with other test data or analyses, that the airplane is free from any aeroelastic instability at all speeds within the altitude-airspeed envelope described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
