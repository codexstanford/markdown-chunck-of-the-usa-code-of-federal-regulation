###### Barrier alignment.

(g)A barrier alignment test must consist of a statistical firing series of ordnance interrupter samples. The test must demonstrate that the interrupter's safe to arm transition motion provides for ordnance initiation with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level. The test must also demonstrate that the interrupter's arm to safe transition motion provides for no ordnance initiation with a reliability of 0.999 at a 95% confidence level. The test may employ a reusable ordnance interrupter subassembly that simulates the flight configuration.
