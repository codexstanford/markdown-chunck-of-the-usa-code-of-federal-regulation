###### Abbreviated antenna pattern.

(g)An abbreviated antenna pattern test must determine any antenna pattern changes that might have occurred due to damage to an antenna resulting from exposure to test environments. This must include all of the following:

(1) The antenna must undergo the test before and after exposure to the qualification or acceptance test environments.

(2) The test must use a standard ground plane test fixture. The test configuration need not generate antenna pattern data that is representative of the actual system-level patterns.

(3) The test must include gain measurements in the 0&#xB0; and 90&#xB0; plane vectors and a conical cut at 80&#xB0;.
