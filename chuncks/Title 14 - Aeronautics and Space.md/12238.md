###### Post acceptance discharge and storage.

(h)Post acceptance discharge and storage of a nickel-cadmium battery or cell must prevent any damage that could affect electrical performance. This must include all of the following:

(1) Any battery must undergo discharge to a voltage between 0.05 volts and 0.9 volts to prevent cell reversal, allow safe handling, and minimize any aging degradation;

(2) Any individual cell must undergo discharge to no greater than 0.05 volts to allow safe handling and minimize any aging degradation;

(3) After the discharge, each battery or cell must undergo storage in an open circuit configuration and under storage conditions that protect against any performance degradation and are consistent with the qualification tests. This must include a storage temperature of no greater than 5 &#xB0;C.
