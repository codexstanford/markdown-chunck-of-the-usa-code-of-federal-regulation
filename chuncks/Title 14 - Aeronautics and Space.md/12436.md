###### Statistical toxic risk management for launch processing.

(l)The launch operator must use statistical toxic risk management to protect public safety if a process that involves the use of a toxic propellant does not satisfy the containment requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. A launch operator, for each such case, must perform a toxic risk assessment and develop criteria that protect the public from risks due to planned and potential toxic release. A launch operator must ensure that the resultant toxic risk meets the collective and individual risk criteria requirements defined in ยง 417.107(b). A launch operator's toxic risk assessment must account for the following:

(1) All credible equipment failure and non-failure modes, along with the consequent release and combustion of toxic propellants;

(2) Equipment failure rates;

(3) The effect of positive or negative buoyancy on the rise or descent of the released toxic propellants;

(4) The influence of atmospheric physics on the transport and diffusion of toxic propellants released;

(5) Meteorological conditions at the time of the process;

(6) Population density, location, susceptibility (health categories) and sheltering for populations within each potential toxic hazard area; and

(7) Exposure duration and toxic propellant concentration or dosage that would result in casualty for populations.
