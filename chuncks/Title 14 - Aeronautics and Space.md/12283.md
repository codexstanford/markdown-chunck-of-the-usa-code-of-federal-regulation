###### Input command processing.

(c)An input command processing test must demonstrate that an exploding bridgewire firing unit's input trigger circuit satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to any variation in input that it could experience during flight. The firing unit must undergo this test before the first and after the last environmental test to identify any degradation in performance due to any of the test environments. The test must demonstrate all of the following:

(1) The amplitude sensitivity of the firing unit trigger circuit provides margin over the worst-case trigger signal that could be delivered on the launch vehicle as follows:

(i) The firing unit triggers at 50% of the amplitude and 50% of the pulse duration of the lowest trigger signal that could be delivered during flight; and

(ii) The firing unit triggers at 120% amplitude and 120% of the pulse duration of the highest trigger signal that could be delivered during flight;

(2) The firing unit satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to the maximum input voltage of the open circuit voltage of the power source, ground or airborne, and the minimum input voltage of the loaded voltage of the power source;

(3) Each control and switching circuit that is critical to the reliable operation of an exploding bridgewire firing unit does not change state when subjected to a minimum input power drop-out for a period of 50 milliseconds;

(4) The firing unit's response time satisfies all its performance specifications with input at the specified minimum and maximum vehicle supplied trigger signal; and

(5) If the firing unit has differential input, the unit satisfies all its performance specifications with all input combinations at the specified trigger amplitude input signals.
