###### Pre-flight testing of a safe-and-arm device that has an internal electro-explosive device.

(e)An internal electro-explosive device in a safe-and-arm device must undergo a pre-flight test that satisfies all of the following:

(1) The test must take place no earlier than 10 calendar days before the first flight attempt. If the flight is delayed more than 14 calendar days or the flight termination system configuration is broken or modified for any reason, such as to replace batteries, the device must undergo the test again no earlier than 10 calendar days before the next flight attempt. A launch operator may extend the time between the test and flight if the launch operator demonstrates that the electro-explosive device and its firing circuit will each satisfy all their performance specifications when subjected to the expected environments for the extended period of time;

(2) The test must include visual checks for signs of any physical defect or corrosion; and

(3) The test must include a continuity and resistance check of the electro-explosive device circuit while the safe-and-arm device is in the arm position and again while the device is in the safe position.
