###### Critical Time Interval.

(b)When conducting an ATTCS takeoff, the critical time interval is between Vminus 1 second and a point on the minimum performance, all-engine flight path where, assuming a simultaneous occurrence of an engine and ATTCS failure, the resulting minimum flight path thereafter intersects the Part 25 required actual flight path at no less than 400 feet above the takeoff surface. This time interval is shown in the following illustration:

The applicant must comply with the performance and ATTCS reliability requirements as follows:

(a) An ATTCS failure or a combination of failures in the ATTCS during the critical time interval:
