###### Cell conditioning.

(d)Conditioning of a nickel-cadmium cell must stabilize the cell and ensure repeatable electrical performance throughout the cell's service-life. Conditioning of a cell must include both of the following:

(1) Before any testing, each cell must age for no less than 11 months after the manufacturer's lot date code to ensure consistent electrical performance of the cell for its entire service-life; and

(2) After aging, each cell must undergo a first charge at a charging rate of no greater than its capacity divided by 20 (C/20), to initialize the chemistry within the cell. Any battery stored for over one month after the first charge must undergo recharging at the same rate.
