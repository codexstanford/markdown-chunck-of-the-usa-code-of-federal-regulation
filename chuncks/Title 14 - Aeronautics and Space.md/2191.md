###### Pre-detection ice

(5)is the ice accretion before detection of flight conditions in this Appendix that require exiting per ยง 25.1420(a)(1) and (2). It is the pre-existing ice accretion that may exist from operating in icing conditions in which the airplane is approved to operate prior to encountering the icing conditions requiring an exit, plus the ice accumulated during the time needed to detect the icing conditions, followed by two minutes of further ice accumulation to take into account the time for the flightcrew to take action to exit the icing conditions, including coordination with air traffic control.

(i) For an airplane certified in accordance with ยง 25.1420(a)(1), the pre-existing ice accretion must be based on the icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part.

(ii) For an airplane certified in accordance with ยง 25.1420(a)(2), the pre-existing ice accretion must be based on the more critical of the icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part, or the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix in which the airplane is capable of safely operating.
