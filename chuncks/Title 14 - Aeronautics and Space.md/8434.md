###### General wage determination.

(b)Whenever the wage patterns in a particular area for a particular type of construction are well settled and whenever it may be reasonably anticipated that there will be a large volume of procurement in that area for that type of construction, the Secretary of Labor, upon the request of a Federal agency or in his discretion, may issue a general wage determination when, after consideration of the facts and circumstances involved, he finds that the applicable statutory standards and those of part 1, 29 CFR, subtitle A, will be met. This general wage determination is used for all projects located in the area and for the type of construction covered by the general wage determination.
