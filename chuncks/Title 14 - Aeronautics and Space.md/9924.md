The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.

(ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director-Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).
