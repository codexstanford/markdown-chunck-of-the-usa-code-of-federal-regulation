####### ยง 29.479 Level landing conditions.
######## Loading conditions.

(b)The rotorcraft must be designed for the following landing loading conditions:

(1) Vertical loads applied under ยง 29.471.

(2) The loads resulting from a combination of the loads applied under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with drag loads at each wheel of not less than 25 percent of the vertical load at that wheel.

(3) The vertical load at the instant of peak drag load combined with a drag component simulating the forces required to accelerate the wheel rolling assembly up to the specified ground speed, with-

(i) The ground speed for determination of the spin-up loads being at least 75 percent of the optimum forward flight speed for minimum rate of descent in autorotation; and

(ii) The loading conditions of paragraph (b) applied to the landing gear and its attaching structure only.

(4) If there are two wheels forward, a distribution of the loads applied to those wheels under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section in a ratio of 40:60.
