####### Structures and material handling equipment.

(b)A launch operator must ensure safety factors applied in the design of a structure or material handling equipment account for static and dynamic loads, environmental stresses, expected wear, and duty cycles. A launch operator must:

(1) Inspect structures and material handling equipment to verify workmanship, proper operations, and maintenance;

(2) Prepare plans to ensure proper operations and maintenance of structures and material handling equipment;

(3) Assess structures and material handling equipment for potential single point failure;

(4) Eliminate single point failures from structures and material handling equipment or subject the structures and material handling equipment to specific inspection and testing to ensure proper operation. Single point failure welds must undergo both surface and volumetric non-destructive inspection to verify that no rejectable discontinuities exist;

(5) Establish other non-destructive inspection techniques if a volumetric inspection cannot be performed. A launch operator, in such a case, must demonstrate through the licensing process that the inspection processes used accurately verify the absence of rejectable discontinuities; and

(6) Ensure qualified and certified personnel, as defined in ยง 417.105, conduct the inspections.
