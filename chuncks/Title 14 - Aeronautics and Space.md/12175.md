###### Operational bandwidth.

(ii)The testing must demonstrate that the receiver decoder satisfies all its performance specifications at twice the worst-case command control system transmitter radio frequency shift, Doppler shifts of the carrier center frequency, and shifts in flight hardware center frequency during flight at the manufacturer guaranteed receiver sensitivity. The test must demonstrate an operational bandwidth of no less than +/-45KHz. The test must demonstrate that the operational bandwidth accounts for any tone deviation and that the receiver sensitivity does not vary by more than 3dB across the bandwidth.
