####### Beam pointing errors.

(2)The elevation angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within the coverage sector must not deviate from the true elevation angle at that point by more than +/-0.04 degree for elevation angles from 2.5&#xB0; to 3.5&#xB0;. Above 3.5&#xB0; these errors may linearly increase to +/-0.1 degree at 7.5&#xB0;. Multipath and drift effects are excluded from this requirement.
