###### Abbreviated status-of-health.

(f)An abbreviated status-of-health test must measure all a firing unit's critical performance parameters while the unit is subjected to each required operating environment to identify any degradation in performance while exposed to each environment. This must include continuous monitoring of the firing unit's input to detect any variation in amplitude. Any amplitude variation constitutes a test failure. The monitoring must have a sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation.
