###### Acceptance thermal vacuum.

(e)An acceptance thermal vacuum test or analysis must demonstrate that a component satisfies all its performance specifications when exposed to the acceptance thermal vacuum environment as follows:

(1) The acceptance thermal vacuum environment must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The thermal vacuum pressure gradient must equal or exceed the maximum predicted rate of altitude change that the component will experience during flight. The pressure gradient must allow for no less than ten minutes for reduction of chamber pressure at the pressure zone from ambient pressure to 20 Pascal;

(ii) The final vacuum dwell-time must last long enough for the component to achieve pressure equilibrium and must last no less than the maximum predicted dwell-time or 12 hours, whichever is greater;

(iii) During the final vacuum dwell-time, the environment must include no less than the maximum predicted number of thermal cycles; and

(iv) Each thermal cycle must range from the higher of the maximum predicted environment high temperature or the workmanship screening high temperature of 61 &#xB0;C, to the lower of the predicted low temperature or the workmanship screening low temperature of -24 &#xB0;C.

(2) Any test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must measure all performance parameters with the component powered at its low and high operating voltages when the component is at ambient temperature before beginning the first thermal cycle and after completing the last cycle.

(ii) The test must measure all performance parameters with the component powered at its low and high operating voltages when the component is at the high and low temperatures during the first, middle, and last thermal cycles; and

(iii) The test must continuously monitor all critical performance and status-of-health parameters during chamber pressure reduction and during the final vacuum dwell-time with the component at its high operating voltage. This monitoring must have a resolution and sample rate that will detect any component performance degradation.

(3) Any analysis must satisfy all of the following:

(i) For any low voltage component of less than 50 volts, any analysis must demonstrate that the component is not susceptible to corona, arcing, or structural failure; and

(ii) Any high voltage component of 50 volts or greater must undergo a thermal vacuum test unless the component is environmentally sealed and the analysis demonstrates that any low voltage externally exposed part of less than 50 volts is not susceptible to corona, arcing, or structural failure. A component with any high voltage externally exposed part must undergo an acceptance thermal vacuum test.
