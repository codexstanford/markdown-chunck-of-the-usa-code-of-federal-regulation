####### § 29.501 Ground loading conditions: landing gear with skids.
######## General.

(a)Rotorcraft with landing gear with skids must be designed for the loading conditions specified in this section. In showing compliance with this section, the following apply:

(1) The design maximum weight, center of gravity, and load factor must be determined under §§ 29.471 through 29.475.

(2) Structural yielding of elastic spring members under limit loads is acceptable.

(3) Design ultimate loads for elastic spring members need not exceed those obtained in a drop test of the gear with-

(i) A drop height of 1.5 times that specified in § 29.725; and

(ii) An assumed rotor lift of not more than 1.5 times that used in the limit drop tests prescribed in § 29.725.

(4) Compliance with paragraph (b) through (e) of this section must be shown with-

(i) The gear in its most critically deflected position for the landing condition being considered; and

(ii) The ground reactions rationally distributed along the bottom of the skid tube.
