####### Exceptions.

(c)(1) The requirement for data and/or information in paragraph (b) of this section will not apply to tariff publications containing new or changed matter which are filed:

(i) In response to Department orders or specific policy pronouncements of the Department directly related to such new or changed matter;

(ii) Pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the Department setting forth the fares, charges (or specific formulas therefor) or other matter: Provided that the changes are submitted with the number of the DOT order of approval and fully comply with any conditions set forth in that order;

(iii) To the extent fares for scheduled passenger service are within a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility; and

(iv) To meet competition: Provided, that

(A) Changed matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it effects decreases in fares or charges and/or increases the value of service so that the level of the fares or charges and the services provided will be substantially similar to the level of fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.

(B) New matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it establishes or affects a fare or charge and a service which will be substantially similar to the fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.

(C) When new or changed matter is filed to meet competition over a portion of the filing air carrier's system and is simultaneously made applicable to the balance of the system, such matter, insofar as it applies over the balance of the system, will be deemed to be within the exception in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if such carrier submits an explanation as to the necessity of maintaining uniformity over its entire system with respect to such new or changed matter.

(D) In any case where new or changed matter is filed to meet competition, the filing carrier or agent must supply, as part of the filing justification, the complete tariff references which will serve to identify the competing tariff matter which the tariff purports to meet. In such case the justification or attachment shall state whether the new or changed matter is identical to the competing tariff matter which it purports to meet or whether it approximates the competing tariff matter. If the new or changed matter is not identical, the transmittal letter or attachment shall contain a statement explaining, in reasonable detail, the basis for concluding that the tariff publication being filed is substantially similar to the competing tariff matter.
