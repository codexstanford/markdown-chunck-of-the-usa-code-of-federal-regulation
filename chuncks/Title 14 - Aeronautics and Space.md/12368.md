###### Initial open-loop test of a secure high-alphabet command destruct system.

(4)Any flight termination system that uses a secure high-alphabet command receiver decoder must undergo an open-loop radio frequency test to demonstrate the integrity of the system between the command control transmitter system and launch vehicle radio frequency system from the antenna to the command receiver decoders. The test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must occur before loading the secure flight code on to the command transmitting system and the command receiver decoders;

(ii) The test must use a non-secure code, also known as a maintenance code, loaded on to the command control transmitting system and the command receiver decoders;

(iii) Each command receiver decoder must be powered by either the ground or launch vehicle power sources;

(iv) The command control transmitter system must transmit, open-loop, all receiver decoder commands required for the flight termination system functions, including pilot or check tone to the vehicle;

(v) The test must demonstrate that each command receiver decoder receives, decodes and outputs each command sent by the command control system; and

(vi) The testing must demonstrate that all primary and redundant flight termination system components, flight termination system circuits, and command control system transmitting equipment are operational.
