###### Static discharge.

(i)A static discharge test must demonstrate that an electro-explosive device can withstand an electrostatic discharge that it could experience from personnel or conductive surfaces without firing and still satisfy all its performance specifications. The test must subject the electro-explosive device to the greater of:

(1) A 25k-volt, 500-picofarad pin-to-pin discharge through a 5k-ohm resistor and a 25k-volt, 500-picofarad pin-to-case discharge with no resistor; or

(2) The maximum predicted pin-to-pin and pin-to-case electrostatic discharges.
