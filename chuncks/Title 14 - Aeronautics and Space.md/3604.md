###### Data corrections.

(c)(1) Aircraft position, performance data and noise measurement must be corrected to the noise certification reference conditions as prescribed in sections H36.3 and H36.205 of this appendix.

(2) The measured flight path must be corrected by an amount equal to the difference between the applicant's predicted flight path for the certification reference conditions and the measured flight path at the test conditions. Necessary corrections relating to helicopter flight path or performance may be derived from FAA-approved data for the difference between measured and reference conditions, together with appropriate allowances for sound attenuation with distance. The Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) correction may not exceed 2.0 EPNdB except for takeoff flight condition, where the correction may not exceed 4.0 EPNdB, of which the arithmetic sum of Δ(described in section H36.205(f)(1)) and the term -7.5 log (AL/AL) from Δterm (described in section H36.205(g)(1)(i)) may not exceed 2.0 EPNdB, for any combination of the following:

(i) The helicopter not passing vertically above the measuring station.

(ii) Any difference between the reference flight track and the actual test flight track; and

(iii) Detailed correction requirements prescribed in section H36.205 of this appendix.

(3) Helicopter sound pressure levels within the 10 dB-down time interval must exceed the mean background sound pressure levels determined under section B36.3.9.11 by at least 3 dB in each one-third octave band, or must be corrected under an FAA-approved method.
