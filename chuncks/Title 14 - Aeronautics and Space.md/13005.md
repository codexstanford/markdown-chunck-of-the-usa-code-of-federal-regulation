####### Criteria.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, for an orbital or suborbital launch or reentry, an operator must establish window closures needed to ensure that the launch or reentry vehicle, any jettisoned components, or payloads meet the following requirements with respect to orbiting objects, not including any object being launched or reentered.

(1) For inhabitable objects, one of three criteria below must be met:

(i) The probability of collision between the launching or reentering objects and any inhabitable object must not exceed 1 x 10;

(ii) The launching or reentering objects must maintain an ellipsoidal separation distance of 200 km in-track and 50 km cross-track and radially from the inhabitable object; or

(iii) The launching or reentering objects must maintain a spherical separation distance of 200 km from the inhabitable object.

(2) For objects that are neither orbital debris nor inhabitable, one of the two criteria below must be met:

(i) The probability of collision between the launching or reentering objects and any object must not exceed 1 x 10; or

(ii) The launching or reentering objects must maintain a spherical separation distance of 25 km from the object.

(3) For all other known orbital debris identified by the FAA or other Federal Government entity as large objects with radar cross section greater than 1 mand medium objects with radar cross section 0.1 mto 1 m:

(i) The probability of collision between the launching or reentering objects and any known orbital debris must not exceed 1 x 10; or

(ii) The launching or reentering objects must maintain a spherical separation distance of 2.5 km.
