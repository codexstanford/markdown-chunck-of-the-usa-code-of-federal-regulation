A36.9.4.2

(a) The portions of the test flight path and the reference flight path described in paragraph (a)(1) and (2), and illustrated in Figure A36-10, include the noise time history that is relevant to the calculation of flyover and approach EPNL. In figure A36-10:

(1) XY represents the portion of the measured flight path that includes the noise time history relevant to the calculation of flyover and approach EPNL; XYrepresents the corresponding reference flight path.

(2) The points Q, Q, Qrepresent airplane positions on the measured flight path at time t, tand trespectively. Point Qis the point at which the noise was emitted and observed as one-third octave values SPL(i)at the noise measuring station K at time t. Point Qrepresents the corresponding position on the reference flight path for noise observed as SPL(i)at the reference measuring station Kat time t. QK and QKare respectively the measured and reference noise propagation paths, which in each case form the angle &#x3B8;with their respective flight paths. Qand Qare similarly the points on the reference flight path corresponding to Qand Qon the measured flight path. Qand Qare chosen so that between Qand Qall values of PNLT(computed as described in paragraphs A36.9.4.2.2 and A36.9.4.2.3) within 10 dB of the peak value are included.
