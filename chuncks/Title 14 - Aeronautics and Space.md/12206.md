###### Multiple electrical cycles.

(2)For a silver-zinc cell from a battery that has more than one charge-discharge cycle, a capacity test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The cell must undergo activation that satisfies paragraph (j) of this section;

(ii) The test must subject the cell to the maximum predicted number of charge-discharge cycles that the battery will experience during normal operations;

(iii) At the end of each cycle life after each charge, the test must satisfy all of the following:

(A) The cell must undergo a discharge of the manufacturer's nameplate capacity;

(B) The cell must then undergo the electrical performance test of paragraph (k) of this section using the qualification electrical load profile described in paragraph (k)(7)(ii) of this section; and

(C) The cell must then undergo a discharge to determine the positive plate capacity;

(iv) At the end of the cycle life of the last charge-discharge cycle, in addition to determining the positive plate capacity, the cell must undergo a discharge to determine the negative plate capacity; and

(v) The test must demonstrate that each capacity for each cycle satisfies the manufacturer's specification and is in-family.
