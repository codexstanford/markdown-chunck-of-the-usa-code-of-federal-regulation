###### Thermal cycle.

(o)A thermal cycle test must demonstrate that a silver-zinc battery or cell satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to pre-flight thermal cycle environments, including acceptance testing, and flight thermal cycle environments. This must include all of the following:

(1) The test must subject the battery or cell to no less than the acceptance-number of thermal cycles that satisfies section E417.13(d)(1);

(2) The thermal cycle environment must satisfy all of the following:

(i) Each thermal cycle must range from 10 &#xB0;C above the maximum predicted temperature range to 5.5 &#xB0;C below. If the launch vehicle's telemetry system does not provide the battery's temperature before and during flight as described in section D417.17(b)(9), each thermal cycle must range from 10 &#xB0;C above the maximum predicted temperature range to 10 &#xB0;C below;

(ii) For each cycle, the dwell-time at each high and low temperature must last long enough for the battery or cell to achieve internal thermal equilibrium and must last no less than one hour; and

(iii) When heating and cooling the battery or cell, the temperature change at a rate that averages 1 &#xB0;C per minute or the maximum predicted rate, whichever is greater;

(3) Each battery or cell must undergo the electrical performance test of paragraph (k) of this section when the battery or cell is at ambient temperature before beginning the first thermal cycle and after completing the last cycle;

(4) Each battery or cell must undergo the electrical performance test of paragraph (k) of this section, at the high and low temperatures during the first, middle and last thermal cycles; and

(5) The test must continuously monitor and record all critical performance and status-of-health parameters, including the battery or cell's open circuit voltage, during all thermal cycle dwell times and transitions with a resolution and sample rate that will detect any performance degradation.
