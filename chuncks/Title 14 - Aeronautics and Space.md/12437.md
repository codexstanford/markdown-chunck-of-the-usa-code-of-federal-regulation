###### Launch processing toxic release hazard analysis products.

(m)The products of a launch operator's toxic release hazards analysis for launch processing must include the following:

(1) For each worst-case release scenario, a description of the vessel or pipeline and toxic propellant selected as the worst case for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for selection of that scenario. Assumptions must include use of administrative controls and passive mitigation that were assumed to limit the quantity that could be released. The description must include the anticipated effect of the controls and mitigation on the release quantity and rate;

(2) For each worst-case alternative release scenario, a description of the scenario identified for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for the selection of that scenario. Assumptions must include use of administrative controls and passive mitigation that were assumed to limit the quantity that could be released. The description must include the anticipated effect of the controls and mitigation on the release quantity and rate;

(3) Estimated quantity released, release rate, and duration of release for each worst-case scenario and worst-case alternative scenario for each process;

(4) A description of the methodology used to determine the toxic hazard distance for each toxic concentration threshold;

(5) Data used to estimate off-site population receptors potentially affected; and

(6) The following data for each worst-case scenario and worst-case alternative release scenario:

(i) Chemical name;

(ii) Physical state;

(iii) Basis of results (provide model name if used, or other methodology);

(iv) Scenario (explosion, fire, toxic gas release, or liquid spill and vaporization);

(v) Quantity released in pounds;

(vi) Release rate;

(vii) Release duration;

(viii) Wind speed and atmospheric stability class;

(ix) Topography;

(x) Toxic hazard distance;

(xi) All members of the public within the toxic hazard distance;

(xii) Any passive mitigation considered; and

(xiii) Active mitigation considered (worst-case alternative release scenario only).
