###### Correction for spectral irregularities.

A36.4.3

A36.4.3.1 Noise having pronounced spectral irregularities (for example, the maximum discrete frequency components or tones) must be adjusted by the correction factor C(k) calculated as follows:

(a) Step 1: After applying the corrections specified under section A36.3.9, start with the sound pressure level in the 80 Hz one-third octave band (band number 3), calculate the changes in sound pressure level (or "slopes") in the remainder of the one-third octave bands as follows:

(b) Step 2: Encircle the value of the slope, s(i, k), where the absolute value of the change in slope is greater than five; that is where:

(c) Step 3:

(1) If the encircled value of the slope s(i, k) is positive and algebraically greater than the slope s(i-1, k) encircle SPL(i, k).

(2) If the encircled value of the slope s(i, k) is zero or negative and the slope s(i-1, k) is positive, encircle SPL(i-1, k).

(3) For all other cases, no sound pressure level value is to be encircled.

(d) Step 4: Compute new adjusted sound pressure levels SPL&#x2032;(i, k) as follows:

(1) For non-encircled sound pressure levels, set the new sound pressure levels equal to the original sound pressure levels, SPL&#x2032;(i, k) = SPL(i, k).

(2) For encircled sound pressure levels in bands 1 through 23 inclusive, set the new sound pressure level equal to the arithmetic average of the preceding and following sound pressure levels as shown below:

(3) If the sound pressure level in the highest frequency band (i = 24) is encircled, set the new sound pressure level in that band equal to:

(e) Step 5: Recompute new slope s&#x2032;(i, k), including one for an imaginary 25th band, as follows:

(f) Step 6: For i, from 3 through 23, compute the arithmetic average of the three adjacent slopes as follows:

(g) Step 7: Compute final one-third octave-band sound pressure levels, SPL&#x2032; (i,k), by beginning with band number 3 and proceeding to band number 24 as follows:
