###### Battery case integrity.

(k)A battery case integrity test of a sealed nickel-cadmium battery must demonstrate that the battery will not lose structural integrity or create a hazardous condition when subjected to all predicted operating conditions and all required margins and that the battery's leak rate satisfies all its performance specifications. This must include all of the following:

(1) The test must monitor the battery's pressure while subjecting the battery case to no less than 1.5 times the greatest operating pressure differential that could occur under qualification testing, pre-flight, or flight conditions;

(2) The pressure monitoring must have a resolution and sample rate that allows accurate determination of the battery's leak rate;

(3) The test must demonstrate that the battery's leak rate is no greater than the equivalent of 10scc/sec of helium; and

(4) The battery must undergo examination to identify any condition that indicates that the battery might loose structural integrity or create a hazardous condition.
