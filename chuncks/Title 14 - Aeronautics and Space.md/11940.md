###### Input.

(c)A trajectory analysis requires the input necessary to produce a six-degree-of-freedom trajectory. A launch operator must use each of the following as inputs to the trajectory computations:

(1) Launcher data, as follows-

(i) Geodetic latitude and longitude;

(ii) Height above sea level;

(iii) All location errors; and

(iv) Launch azimuth and elevation.

(2) Reference ellipsoidal Earth model, as follows-

(i) Name of the Earth model employed;

(ii) Semi-major axis;

(iii) Semi-minor axis;

(iv) Eccentricity;

(v) Flattening parameter;

(vi) Gravitational parameter;

(vii) Rotation angular velocity;

(viii) Gravitational harmonic constants; and

(ix) Mass of the Earth.
