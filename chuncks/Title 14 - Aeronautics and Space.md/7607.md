##### Appendix A to Part 136 - Special Operating Rules for Air Tour Operators in the State of Hawaii
###### Section 4. Helicopter performance plan.

Each operator must complete a performance plan before each helicopter air tour flight. The performance plan must be based on the information in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM), considering the maximum density altitude for which the operation is planned for the flight to determine the following:

(a) Maximum gross weight and center of gravity (CG) limitations for hovering in ground effect;

(b) Maximum gross weight and CG limitations for hovering out of ground effect; and,

(c) Maximum combination of weight, altitude, and temperature for which height-velocity information in the RFM is valid.

The pilot in command (PIC) must comply with the performance plan.
