####### ยง 11.35 Does FAA include sensitive security information and proprietary information in the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS)?
######## Proprietary information.

(b)When we are aware of proprietary information filed with a comment, we do not place it in the docket. We hold it in a separate file to which the public does not have access, and place a note in the docket that we have received it. If we receive a request to examine or copy this information, we treat it as any other request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). We process such a request under the DOT procedures found in 49 CFR part 7.
