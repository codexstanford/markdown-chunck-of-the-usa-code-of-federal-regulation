###### Ordnance components.

(4)For any ordnance component, a qualification thermal cycle test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The qualification thermal cycle must range from 10 &#xB0;C above the predicted highest temperature, or 71 &#xB0;C, whichever is higher, to 10 &#xB0;C below the predicted lowest temperature, or -54 &#xB0;C, whichever is lower;

(ii) The test must subject each ordnance component to no less than the acceptance-number of thermal cycles. For each component, the acceptance-number of thermal cycles must satisfy section E417.13(d)(1). For an ordnance component that is used inside a safe-and-arm device, the test must subject the component to three times the acceptance-number of thermal cycles. For each cycle, the dwell-time at each high and low temperature must last long enough for the component to achieve internal thermal equilibrium and must last no less than two hours; and

(iii) When heating or cooling the component, the temperature must change at an average rate of 3 &#xB0;C per minute or the maximum predicted rate, whichever is greater.
