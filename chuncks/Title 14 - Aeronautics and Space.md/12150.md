(2) The components of a radio frequency receiving system must satisfy each test or analysis identified by any table of this section to demonstrate that:

(i) The system is capable of delivering command control system radio frequency energy to each flight termination system receiver; and

(ii) The system satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to each non-operating and operating environment and any performance degradation source. Such sources include any command control system transmitter variation, non-nominal launch vehicle flight condition, and flight termination system performance variation.
