####### Average daily departures

means the average number of scheduled departures per day of air carrier aircraft computed on the basis of the busiest 3 consecutive calendar months of the immediately preceding 12 consecutive calendar months. However, if the average daily departures are expected to increase, then "average daily departures" may be determined by planned rather than current activity, in a manner authorized by the Administrator.
