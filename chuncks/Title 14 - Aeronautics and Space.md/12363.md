###### Pre-flight testing for command receiver decoders and other electronic components.

(h)(1) An electronic component, including any component that contains piece part circuitry, such as a command receiver decoder, must undergo a pre-flight test that satisfies all of the following:

(i) The test must take place no earlier than 180 calendar days before flight. If the 180-day period expires before flight, the launch operator must replace the component with one that meets the 180-day requirement or test the component in place on the launch vehicle. The test must satisfy the alternate procedures for testing the component on the launch vehicle contained in the test plan and procedures required by section E417.1(c); and

(ii) The component must undergo the test at ambient temperature. The test must measure all performance parameters measured during acceptance testing.

(2) A launch operator may substitute an acceptance test for a pre-flight test if the acceptance test is performed no earlier than 180 calendar days before flight.
