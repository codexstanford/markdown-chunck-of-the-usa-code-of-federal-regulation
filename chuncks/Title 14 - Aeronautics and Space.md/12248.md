###### Internal inspection.

(r)An internal inspection of a nickel-cadmium battery must identify any excessive wear or damage to the battery, including any of its cells, after the battery is exposed to all the qualification test environments. An internal inspection must satisfy section E417.5(g) and include all of the following:

(1) An internal examination to verify that there was no movement of any component within the battery that stresses that component beyond its design limit;

(2) An examination to verify the integrity of all cell and wiring interconnects;

(3) An examination to verify the integrity of all potting and shimming materials;

(4) The removal of all cells from the battery and examination of each cell for any physical damage;

(5) A test with a chemical indicator to demonstrate that none of the cells leaked; and

(6) Destructive physical analysis of one cell from each corner and one cell from the middle of each battery that undergoes all the qualification tests. The destructive physical analysis must verify the integrity of all connections between all plate tabs and cell terminals, and the integrity of each plate and separator.
