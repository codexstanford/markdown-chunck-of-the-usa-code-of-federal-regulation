###### Storage temperature.

(b)A storage temperature test or analysis must demonstrate that a component will satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to the maximum predicted high and low temperatures, thermal cycles, and dwell-times at the high and low temperatures that the component could experience under storage conditions as follows:

(1) Any storage temperature test must subject the component to the range of temperatures from 10 &#xB0;C lower than the maximum predicted storage thermal range to 10 &#xB0;C higher. The rate of change from one thermal extreme to the other must be no less than the maximum predicted thermal rate of change. All thermal dwell-times and thermal cycles must be no less than those of the maximum predicted storage environment.

(2) Any analysis must demonstrate that the qualification operating thermal cycle environment is more severe than the storage thermal environment by satisfying one of the following:

(i) The analysis must include thermal fatigue equivalence calculations that demonstrate that the large change in temperature for a few thermal cycles experienced during flight is a more severe environment than the relatively small change in temperature for many thermal cycles that would be experienced during storage; or

(ii) The analysis must demonstrate that the component's operating qualification thermal cycle range encompasses -34 &#xB0;C to 71 &#xB0;C and that any temperature variation that the component experiences during storage does not exceed 22 &#xB0;C.
