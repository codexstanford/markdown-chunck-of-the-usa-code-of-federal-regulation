###### General.

(a)NASA is not an insurer and does not underwrite all personal property losses that an employee may sustain. Employees are encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from NASA. The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the claimant to obtain the maximum amount of compensation for personal property loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of the claim.
