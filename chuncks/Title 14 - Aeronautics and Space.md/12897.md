###### ยง 450.108 Flight abort.
####### Flight safety limits constraints.

(d)An operator must determine flight safety limits that-

(1) Account for temporal and geometric extents on the Earth's surface of any reasonably foreseeable vehicle hazards under all reasonably foreseeable conditions during normal and malfunctioning flight;

(2) Account for physics of hazard generation and transport including uncertainty;

(3) Account for the potential to lose valid data necessary to evaluate the flight abort rules;

(4) Account for the time delay, including uncertainties, between the violation of a flight abort rule and the time when the flight safety system is expected to activate;

(5) Account in individual, collective, and conditional risk evaluations both for proper functioning of the flight safety system and failure of the flight safety system;

(6) Are designed to avoid flight abort that results in increased collective risk to the public in uncontrolled areas, compared to continued flight; and

(7) Ensure that any trajectory within the limits of a useful mission that is permitted to fly without abort would meet the collective risk criteria of ยง 450.101(a)(1) or (b)(1) when analyzed as if it were the planned mission in accordance with ยง 450.213(b)(2).
