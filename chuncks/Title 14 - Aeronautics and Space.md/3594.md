###### Takeoff reference profile.

(c)(1) Figure H1 illustrates a typical takeoff profile, including reference conditions.

(2) The reference flight path is defined as a straight line segment inclined from the starting point (1,640 feet (500 meters) from the center microphone location and 65 feet (20 meters) above ground level) at a constant climb angle &#x3B2; defined by the certificated best rate of climb and Vfor minimum engine performance. The constant climb angle &#x3B2; is derived from the manufacturer's data (approved by the FAA) to define the flight profile for the reference conditions. The constant climb angle &#x3B2; is drawn through Cand continues, crossing over station A, to the position corresponding to the end of the type certification takeoff path represented by position I.
