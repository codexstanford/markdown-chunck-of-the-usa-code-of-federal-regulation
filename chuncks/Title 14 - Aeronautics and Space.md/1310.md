######## Maximum pitch control displacement at V

(1). The airplane is assumed to be flying in steady level flight (point A, ยง 25.333(b)) and the cockpit pitch control is suddenly moved to obtain extreme nose up pitching acceleration. In defining the tail load, the response of the airplane must be taken into account. Airplane loads that occur subsequent to the time when normal acceleration at the c.g. exceeds the positive limit maneuvering load factor (at point Ain ยง 25.333(b)), or the resulting tailplane normal load reaches its maximum, whichever occurs first, need not be considered.
