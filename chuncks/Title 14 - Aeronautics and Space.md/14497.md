###### Actions between meetings.

(f)When, in the judgment of the Chairman, it is desirable for the Board to consider action without holding a meeting, the relevant information and recommendations for action may be transmitted to the members by the Chief Administrative Officer and the voting members may communicate their votes to the Chairman in writing (including an action signed in counterpart by each Board member), electronically, or orally (including telephone communication). Any action taken under this paragraph has the same effect as an action taken at a meeting. Any such action shall be recorded in the minutes. If a voting member believes the matter should be considered at a meeting, the member may so notify the Chief Administrative Officer and the matter will be scheduled for consideration at a meeting.
