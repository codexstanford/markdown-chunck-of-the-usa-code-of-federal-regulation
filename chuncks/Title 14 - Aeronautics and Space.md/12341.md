###### Firing tests,General.

(b)-(1)A firing test of an explosive transfer system, explosive manifold, or destruct charge must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must demonstrate that each ordnance sample satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to all qualification stress conditions;

(ii) The number of samples that the test must fire and the test conditions, including temperature, must satisfy each table of this section;

(iii) Before initiation, each ordnance sample must experience the required temperature for enough time to achieve thermal equilibrium;

(iv) For any destruct charge, the test must initiate the charge against a witness plate to demonstrate that the charge satisfies all its performance specifications and is in-family;

(v) For any explosive transfer system component, the test must measure ordnance output using a measuring device, such as a swell cap or dent block, to demonstrate that the ordnance output satisfies all its performance specifications; and

(vi) For any explosive manifold that contains ordnance, the test must initiate the ordnance using an explosive transfer system in a flight representative configuration.
