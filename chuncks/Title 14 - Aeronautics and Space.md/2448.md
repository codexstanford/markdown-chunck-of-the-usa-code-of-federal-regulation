######## Combustion air ducts.

(e)Each combustion air duct must be fireproof for a distance great enough to prevent damage from backfiring or reverse flame propagation.

(1) No combustion air duct may connect with the ventilating airstream unless flames from backfires or reverse burning cannot enter the ventilating airstream under any operating condition, including reverse flow or malfunction of the heater or its associated components.

(2) No combustion air duct may restrict the prompt relief of any backfire that, if so restricted, could cause heater failure.
