###### ยง 417.213 Flight safety limits analysis.
####### Flight safety limits.

(b)The analysis must establish flight safety limits for use in establishing flight termination rules. Section 417.113(c) contains requirements for flight termination rules. The flight safety limits must account for all temporal and geometric extents on the Earth's surface of a launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion resulting from any planned or unplanned event for all times during flight. Flight safety limits must account for all potential contributions to the debris impact dispersions, including at a minimum:

(1) All time delays, as established by the time delay analysis of ยง 417.221;

(2) Residual thrust remaining after flight termination implementation or vehicle breakup due to aerodynamic and inertial loads;

(3) All wind effects;

(4) Velocity imparted to vehicle fragments by breakup;

(5) All lift and drag forces on the malfunctioning vehicle and falling debris;

(6) All launch vehicle guidance and performance errors;

(7) All launch vehicle malfunction turn capabilities; and

(8) Any uncertainty due to map errors and launch vehicle tracking errors.
