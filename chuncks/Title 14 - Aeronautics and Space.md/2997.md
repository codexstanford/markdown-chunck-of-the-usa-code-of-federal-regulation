The assumed temperature lapse rate is 3.6 degrees F. per thousand feet of altitude above sea level until a temperature of -69.7 degrees F. is reached, above which altitude the temperature is considered constant at -69.7 degrees F. However, for winterization installations, the applicant may select a maximum ambient atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of less than 100 degrees F.
