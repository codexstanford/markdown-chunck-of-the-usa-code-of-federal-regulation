###### End-to-end test of a non-secure command receiver decoder system.

(2)Any flight termination system that uses a non-secure command receiver decoder must undergo an end-to-end test of all flight termination system subsystems, including command destruct systems and inadvertent separation destruct systems. The test must satisfy all of the following:

(i) The test must take place no earlier than 72 hours before the first flight attempt. After the test, if the flight is delayed more than 14 calendar days or the flight termination system configuration is broken or modified for any reason, such as to replace batteries, the system must undergo the end-to-end test again no earlier than 72 hours before the next flight attempt;

(ii) The flight termination system, except for all ordnance initiation devices, must undergo the test in its final onboard launch vehicle configuration;

(iii) The test must use a destruct initiator simulator that satisfies ยง 417.307(h) in place of each flight initiator to demonstrate that the command destruct and inadvertent separation destruct systems deliver the required energy to initiate the flight termination system ordnance;

(iv) The flight termination system must undergo the test while powered by the batteries that the launch vehicle will use for flight. A flight termination system battery must not undergo recharging at any time during or after the end-to-end test. If the battery is recharged at any time before flight the system must undergo the end-to-end test again;

(v) The end-to-end test must exercise all command receiver decoder functions critical to flight termination system operation during flight, including the pilot or check tone, using the command control system transmitters in their flight configuration or other representative equipment;

(vi) The test must demonstrate that all primary and redundant flight termination system components, flight termination system circuits, and command control system transmitting equipment are operational; and

(vii) The test must exercise the triggering mechanism of all electrically initiated inadvertent separation destruct systems to demonstrate that each is operational.
