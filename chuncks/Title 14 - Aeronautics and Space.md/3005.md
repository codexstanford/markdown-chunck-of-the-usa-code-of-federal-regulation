######## Reciprocating engines.

(a)Each reciprocating engine air induction system must have means to prevent and eliminate icing. Unless this is done by other means, it must be shown that, in air free of visible moisture at a temperature of 30 &#xB0;F., and with the engines at 60 percent of maximum continuous power-

(1) Each rotorcraft with sea level engines using conventional venturi carburetors has a preheater that can provide a heat rise of 90 &#xB0;F.;

(2) Each rotorcraft with sea level engines using carburetors tending to prevent icing has a preheater that can provide a heat rise of 70 &#xB0;F.;

(3) Each rotorcraft with altitude engines using conventional venturi carburetors has a preheater that can provide a heat rise of 120 &#xB0;F.; and

(4) Each rotorcraft with altitude engines using carburetors tending to prevent icing has a preheater that can provide a heat rise of 100 &#xB0;F.
