###### Methodology for computing an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site.

(c)An aircraft hazard area analysis must determine an aircraft hazard area that encompasses the launch point from the surface of the Earth to an altitude of 100,000 ft MSL and wholly contains the launch vehicle's normal trajectory plus five nautical miles in every radial direction. A launch operator must calculate an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site as follows:

(1) Using the trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7 or section C417.3, select all data locations where the vehicle's nominal altitude, or positional component on the z-axis, is less than and equal to 100,000 ft MSL.

(2) From the data locations representing the dispersed trajectories calculated as required by section A417.7(d) or section C417.3(f) and modified to incorporate a 5 nm buffer as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the data locations selected below a nominal altitude of 100,000 ft MSL as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, select the location that is the farthest left-hand crossrange, the location that is the farthest right-hand crossrange, the location that is the farthest downrange, and the location that is the farthest uprange.

(3) Construct a box in the xy plane that includes two lines parallel to the azimuth, two lines perpendicular to the azimuth, and contains the four locations selected as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

(4) Extend the box constructed as required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section from the surface of the Earth to an infinite altitude.
