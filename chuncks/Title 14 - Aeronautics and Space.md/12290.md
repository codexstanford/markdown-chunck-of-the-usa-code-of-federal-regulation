###### Static discharge.

(j)A static discharge test must demonstrate that an exploding bridgewire will not fire and satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to any electrostatic discharge that it could experience from personnel or conductive surfaces. The test must subject an exploding bridgewire to the greater of:

(1) A 25k-volt, 500-picofarad pin-to-pin discharge through a 5k-ohm resistor and a 25k-volt, 500-picofarad pin-to-case discharge with no resistor; or

(2) The maximum predicted pin-to-pin and pin-to-case electrostatic discharge.
