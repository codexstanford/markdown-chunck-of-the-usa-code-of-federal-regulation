###### Cell characterization.

(e)Characterization of a nickel-cadmium cell must stabilize the cell chemistry and determine the cell's capacity. A cell characterization must satisfy both of the following:

(1) Each cell must repeatedly undergo charge and discharge cycles until the capacities for three consecutive cycles agree to within 1% of each other; and

(2) During characterization, each cell must remain at a temperature of 20 &#xB0;C +/-2 &#xB0;C to ensure that the cell is not overstressed and to allow repeatable performance.
