###### Imposition of sanctions.

(b)(1) When a party or its representative or attorney or any expert/consultant fails to comply with any direction or order issued by the Board (including an order to provide or permit discovery), or engages in misconduct affecting the Board, its process, or its proceedings, the Board may make such orders as are just, including the imposition of appropriate sanctions. The sanctions may include:

(i) Taking the facts pertaining to the matter in dispute to be established for the purpose of the appeal in accordance with the contention of the party submitting the discovery request;

(ii) Forbidding challenge of the accuracy of any evidence;

(iii) Refusing to allow the noncompliant party to support or pose designated claims or defenses;

(iv) Prohibiting the noncompliant party from introducing in evidence designated documents or items of testimony;

(v) Striking pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed;

(vi) Dismissing the appeal or any part thereof; and/or

(vii) Imposing such other sanctions as the Board deems appropriate.

(2) Prior to imposing sanctions, the Board will provide the noncompliant party with notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether sanctions should be imposed. The opportunity to be heard does not mean that the party is entitled to a hearing; the opportunity to provide written argument shall satisfy this requirement.
