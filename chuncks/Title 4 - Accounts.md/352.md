####### ยง 28.80 Explanation.

An interlocutory appeal is an appeal to the Board of a ruling made by an administrative judge during the course of a proceeding. This appeal may be permitted by the administrative judge if he or she determines that the issue presented is of such importance to the proceeding that it requires the Board's immediate attention. The Board makes a decision on the issue and the administrative judge acts in accordance with that decision.
