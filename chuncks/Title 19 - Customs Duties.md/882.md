###### ยง 10.461 Retail packaging materials and containers.

Packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good for which preferential tariff treatment under the US-CFTA is claimed, will be disregarded in determining whether all non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in General Note 26(n), HTSUS. If the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of such packaging materials and containers will be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.
