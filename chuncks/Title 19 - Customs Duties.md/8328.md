###### Claims based on estimated duties.,see

(b)(1) Drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on estimated duties if one or more of the designated import entries have not been liquidated, or the liquidation has not become final (because of a protest being filed) (also ยง 173.4(c) of this chapter), only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of liquidated import duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim, waiving any right to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the estimated duties on the unliquidated import entry are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on estimated duties is requested under this paragraph. The drawback claimant must, to the best of its knowledge, identify each import entry that has been protested and that is included in the drawback claim. A drawback entry, once finally liquidated on the basis of estimated duties pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, will not be adjusted by reason of a subsequent final liquidation of the import entry.

(2) However, if final liquidation of the import entry discloses that the total amount of import duty is different from the total estimated duties deposited, except in those cases when drawback is 100% of the duty, the party responsible for the payment of liquidated duties, as applicable, will:

(i) Be liable for 1 percent of all increased duties found to be due on that portion of merchandise recorded on the drawback entry; or

(ii) Be entitled to a refund of 1 percent of all excess duties found to have been paid as estimated duties on that portion of the merchandise recorded on the drawback entry.
