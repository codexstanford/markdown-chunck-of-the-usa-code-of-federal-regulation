###### Inventory control and recordkeeping system.

(4)The operator shall establish and maintain a continuing input quality control program to ensure that information concerning merchandise in admission documents, verified or corrected by counts and checks, is accurately recorded in the inventory control and recordkeeping system. Quantities recorded in the system, after allowance by the port director for any discrepancies, will be the quantities of merchandise for which the operator shall be held liable under its bond for admission to the subzone or zone site. A discrepancy involving a within-case shortage (or overage) need not be reported on Customs Form 5931, if the operator is able to report that information in another manner so that the port director can determine whether there is liability for the discrepancy under the bond of any party to the importation.
