Section 190.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)
