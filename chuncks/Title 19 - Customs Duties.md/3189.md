### PART 102 - RULES OF ORIGIN
#### Subpart B - Rules of Origin
##### ยง 102.22 Rules of origin for textile and apparel products of Israel.
###### Applicability.

(a)The provisions of this section will control for purposes of determining whether a textile or apparel product, as defined in ยง 102.21(b)(5), is considered a product of Israel for purposes of the customs laws and the administration of quantitative limitations. A textile or apparel product will be a product of Israel if it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Israel. However, a textile or apparel product that consists of materials produced or derived from, or processed in, another country, or insular possession of the United States, in addition to Israel, will be a product of Israel if it last underwent a substantial transformation in Israel. A textile or apparel product will be considered to have undergone a substantial transformation if it has been transformed by means of substantial manufacturing or processing operations into a new and different article of commerce.
