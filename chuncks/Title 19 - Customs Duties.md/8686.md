##### ยง 191.23 Methods of claiming drawback.
###### Abstract or schedule.

(d)A drawback claimant may use either the abstract or schedule method to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported or destroyed article. An abstract is the summary of records which shows the total quantity used in or appearing in all articles produced during the period covered by the abstract. A schedule shows the quantity of material used in producing, or appearing in, each unit of product. Manufacturers or producers submitting letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see ยง 191.7) and applicants for approval of specific manufacturing drawback rulings (see ยง 191.8) shall state whether the abstract or schedule method is used; if no such statement is made, drawback claims must be based upon the abstract method.
