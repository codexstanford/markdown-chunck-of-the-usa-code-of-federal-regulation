These products are listed on the Aluminum Import Monitoring and Analysis (AIM) system website (). Registered users will be able to obtain aluminum import licenses on the AIM system website. This website contains two sections related to import licensing-the online registration system and the automatic aluminum import license issuance system. Aluminum import licenses must be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP or Customs) as discussed in this section. Information gathered from these licenses will be aggregated and posted on the import monitoring section of the AIM system website.
