###### Owner or interested party.

(5)"Owner or interested party" means one having a legal and possessory interest in the property seized for foreiture or one who was in legal possession of the property at the time of seizure and is entitled to legal possession at the time of granting the petition for expedited procedure. This includes a lienholder, to the extent of his interest in the property, whose claim is in writing (except for a maritime lien which need not be in writing), unless the collateral is in the possession of the secured party. The agreement securing such a lien must create or provide for a security interest in the collateral, describe the collateral and be signed by the debtor.
