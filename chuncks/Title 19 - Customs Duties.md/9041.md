###### Authentication of documentation.

(e)Customs will determine the authenticity of the documents submitted. Once the authenticity of the documents is established, Customs will mark the documents. In most cases the original document(s) will be returned to the exporter. In those cases where the original title document was presented to and retained by Customs and cannot be found prior to the vehicle's export, the exporter's authenticated copy of the original documentation serves as evidence of compliance with the reporting requirements.
