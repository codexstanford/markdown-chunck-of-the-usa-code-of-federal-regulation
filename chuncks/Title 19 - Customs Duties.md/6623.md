###### Addressing and filing prior disclosure

(e)-(1) A written prior disclosure should be addressed to the Commissioner of Customs, have conspicuously printed on the face of the envelope the words "prior disclosure," and be presented to a Customs officer at the Customs port of entry of the disclosed violation.

(2) In the case of a prior disclosure involving violations at multiple ports of entry, the disclosing party may orally disclose or provide copies of the disclosure to all concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officers. In accordance with internal Customs procedures, the officers will then seek consolidation of the disposition and handling of the disclosure. In the event that the claimed "multi-port" disclosure is made to a Customs officer other than the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, the disclosing party must identify all ports involved to enable the concerned Customs officer to refer the disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for consolidation of the proceedings.
