##### § 122.49c Master crew member list and master non-crew member list requirement for commercial aircraft arriving in, departing from, continuing within, and overflying the United States.
###### General requirement.

(a)Air carriers subject to the provisions of §§ 122.49b and 122.75b, with respect to the flights covered in those sections, must electronically transmit to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), by means of an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP, a master crew member list and a master non-crew member list containing the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section covering, respectively, all crew members and non-crew members operating and servicing its flights. The initial transmission of a list must be made at least two days in advance of any flight a crew member or non-crew member on the list will be operating, serving on, or traveling on and must contain the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. After review of the master crew list and the master non-crew list by TSA, TSA will advise the carrier of any crew members or non-crew members that must be removed from the list. Only those persons on the TSA-approved master crew and master non-crew lists will be permitted to operate, serve on, or travel on flights covered by this section. Until a carrier becomes a participant in the CBP-approved electronic interchange system, it must submit the required information in a format provided by TSA.
