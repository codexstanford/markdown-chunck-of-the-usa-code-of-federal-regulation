###### Certificate of registration.

(2)A valid certificate of registration for private aircraft which are U.S.-registered must also be presented upon arrival in the U.S., when presentation for inspection is requested by a Customs officer. A so-called "pink slip" is a duplicate copy of the Aircraft Registration Application (FAA Form AC 8050-1), and does not constitute a valid certificate of registration authorizing travel internationally.
