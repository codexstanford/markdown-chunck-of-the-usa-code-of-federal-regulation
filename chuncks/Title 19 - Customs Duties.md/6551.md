### PART 162 - INSPECTION, SEARCH, AND SEIZURE
#### Subpart E - Treatment of Seized Merchandise
##### § 162.42 Proceedings by libel.

If seizure is made under a statute which provides that the property may be seized and proceeded against by libel, the summary forfeiture procedures set forth in §§ 162.45, 162.46, and 162.47 do not apply. Such cases shall be referred to the U.S. attorney. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may request the U.S. attorney to seek a decree of forfeiture providing for delivery of the property to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for sale or other appropriate disposition, if such property is not to be retained for official use.
