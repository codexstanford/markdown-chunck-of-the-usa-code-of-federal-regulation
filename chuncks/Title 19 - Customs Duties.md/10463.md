(a)Section 751(g) provides a mechanism for incorporating into an ongoing countervailing duty proceeding the results of certain subsidy-related disputes under the WTO Subsidies Agreement. Where the United States, in the WTO, has successfully challenged the "nonactionable" (noncountervailable) status of a foreign subsidy, or where the United States has successfully challenged a prohibited or actionable subsidy, the Secretary may conduct a review to determine the effect, if any, of the successful outcome on an existing countervailing duty order or suspended investigation. This section contains rules regarding the initiation and conduct of reviews under section 751(g).
