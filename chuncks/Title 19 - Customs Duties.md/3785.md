###### Circumstance of change in employment not a bar to adverse action.

(c)Any change in the employment status of a corporate officer (for example, discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to indictment or conviction or after committing any acts which would constitute the culpable behavior described under paragraph (a) of this section, will not preclude application of this section, but may be taken into account by the port director in exercising discretion to take adverse action. If the person whose employment status changed remains in a substantial ownership, control, or beneficial relationship with the CES operator, this factor will also be considered in exercising discretion under this section.
