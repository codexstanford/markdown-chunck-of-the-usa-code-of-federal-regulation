(ii) The final results of an expedited antidumping review;

(iii) A revocation under section 751(d) of the Act;

(iv) The final results of an administrative review, new shipper review, or changed circumstances review, if the Secretary decides that good cause for verification exists; and

(A) A domestic interested party, not later than 100 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of review, submits a written request for verification; and

(B) The Secretary conducted no verification under this paragraph during either of the two immediately preceding administrative reviews.

(2) The Secretary may verify factual information upon which the Secretary relies in a proceeding or a segment of a proceeding not specifically provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(4) The Secretary may conduct verification of a person if that person agrees to verification and the Secretary notifies the government of the affected country and that government does not object. If the person or the government objects to verification, the Secretary will not conduct verification and may disregard any or all information submitted by the person in favor of use of the facts available under section 776 of the Act and ยง 351.308.
