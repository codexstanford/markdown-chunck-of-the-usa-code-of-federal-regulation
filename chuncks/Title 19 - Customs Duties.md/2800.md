##### ยง 19.36 Requirements for duty-free store operations.
###### Personal-use restrictions.

(c)Any duty-free store which delivers conditionally duty-free merchandise to purchasers at an airport exit point must establish, maintain, and enforce written restrictions on the sale of conditionally duty-free merchandise to any one individual to personal-use quantities. Personal-use quantities means quantities that are only suitable for uses other than resale, and includes reasonable quantities for household or family consumption as well as for gifts to others. Proprietors will not knowingly sell or deliver conditionally duty-free merchandise in any quantity to any individual for the purpose of resale. A copy of the restrictions and of any change thereto must be provided to the port director prior to implementation. However, receipt of the written restrictions by CBP will not be construed as approval by CBP of the restrictions. The port director may require any change in the restrictions deemed necessary to conform to the personal-use quantity restriction of this section.
