9. If the violator is being prosecuted criminally, the civil (19 U.S.C. 1497) liability generally is administratively settled only after completion of the prosecution or with the express approval of the appropriate U.S. attorney. Criminal prosecution of the violator, however, is insufficient grounds to delay indefinitely determination of the civil liability. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer should contact the Chief Counsel representative in the field to determine the best course of action to follow with respect to the civil liability. Chief Counsel representative will consult with the U.S. attorney and the Penalties Branch at Customs Headquarters. Because of time delay problems, allinvolving criminal prosecutions must be promptly coordinated in this manner, and consideration should be given to immediate referral of the forfeiture action to the U.S. attorney for the institution of a judicial proceeding.
