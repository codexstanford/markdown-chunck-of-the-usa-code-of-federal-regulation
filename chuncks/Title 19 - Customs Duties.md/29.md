(ii) If the Cargo Declaration covers conventional cargo and containerized or palletized cargo, or both, the use of the abbreviation "SLAC" for "shipper's load and count," or an appropriate abbreviation if similar words are used, is approved:That abbreviation is placed next to each containerized or palletized shipment on the declaration and the following statement is placed on the delaration:

(iii) The statements specified in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be placed on the last page of the Cargo Declaration. Words similar to "the shipper's load and count" may be substituted for those words in the statements. Vague expressions such as "said to contain" or "accepted as containing" are not acceptable. The use of an asterisk or other character instead of appropriate abbreviations, such as "SLAC", is not acceptable.

(4) In addition to the cargo declaration information required in paragraphs (c)(1)-(c)(3) of this section, for all inward foreign cargo, the Cargo Declaration, must state the following:

(iii) The carrier-assigned voyage number;

(iv) The date the vessel is scheduled to arrive at the first U.S. port in CBP territory;

(v) The numbers and quantities from the carrier's ocean bills of lading, either master or house, as applicable (this means that the carrier must transmit the quantity of the lowest external packaging unit; containers and pallets are not acceptable manifested quantities; for example, a container containing 10 pallets with 200 cartons should be manifested as 200 cartons);

(vi) The first foreign port where the carrier takes possession of the cargo destined to the United States;

(vii) A precise description (or the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers to the 6-digit level under which the cargo is classified if that information is received from the shipper) and weight of the cargo or, for a sealed container, the shipper's declared description and weight of the cargo. Generic descriptions, specifically those such as "FAK" ("freight of all kinds"), "general cargo", and "STC" ("said to contain") are not acceptable;

(viii) The shipper's complete name and address, or identification number, from all bills of lading. (At the master bill level, for consolidated shipments, the identity of the Non Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC), freight forwarder, container station or other carrier is sufficient; for non-consolidated shipments, and for each house bill in a consolidated shipment, the identity of the foreign vendor, supplier, manufacturer, or other similar party is acceptable (and the address of the foreign vendor, etc., must be a foreign address); by contrast, the identity of the carrier, NVOCC, freight forwarder or consolidator is not acceptable; the identification number will be a unique number assigned by CBP upon the implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment);

(ix) The complete name and address of the consignee, or identification number, from all bills of lading. (For consolidated shipments, at the master bill level, the NVOCC, freight forwarder, container station or other carrier may be listed as the consignee. For non-consolidated shipments, and for each house bill in a consolidated shipment, the consignee is the party to whom the cargo will be delivered in the United States, with the exception of "FROB" (foreign cargo remaining on board). However, in the case of cargo shipped "to order of [a named party]," the carrier must report this named "to order" party as the consignee; and, if there is any other commercial party listed in the bill of lading for delivery or contact purposes, the carrier must also report this other commercial party's identity and contact information (address) in the "Notify Party" field of the advance electronic data transmission to CBP, to the extent that the CBP-approved electronic data interchange system is capable of receiving this data. The identification number will be a unique number assigned by CBP upon implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment);
