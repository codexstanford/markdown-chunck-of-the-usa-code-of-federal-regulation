### PART 182 - UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
#### Appendix A to Part 182 - Rules of Origin Regulations
##### origin identifier

means any mark that identifies fungible goods as originating goods or non-originating goods.

11 The following inventory management methods may be used for determining whether fungible goods referred to in paragraph 8(18)(b) of these Regulations are originating goods:

(a) Specific identification method;

(b) FIFO method;

(c) LIFO method; and

(d) average method.

12 An exporter of a good, or a person from whom the exporter acquired the fungible good, may choose only one of the inventory management methods referred to in section 11, including only one averaging period in the case of the average method, in each fiscal year of that exporter or person for each finished goods inventory of the exporter or person.

13 (1) Except as provided under subsection (2), if the exporter or person referred to in section 12 chooses the specific identification method, the exporter or person must physically segregate, in finished goods inventory, originating goods that are fungible goods from non-originating goods that are fungible goods.

(2) If originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods are marked with an origin identifier, the exporter or person need not physically segregate those goods under subsection (1) if the origin identifier is visible on the fungible goods.

14 (1) If the exporter or person referred to in section 12 chooses the average method, the origin of each shipment of fungible goods withdrawn from finished goods inventory during a month or three-month period, at the choice of the exporter or person, is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory for the preceding one-month or three-month period that is calculated by dividing

(a) the sum of

(i) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and

(ii) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period, by

(b) the sum of

(i) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and

(ii) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period.

(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding month or three-month period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible goods remaining in finished goods inventory at the end of the preceding month or three-month period.

15 (1) Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), if the exporter or person referred to in section 12 has fungible goods in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible goods is determined by

(a) identifying, in the books of the exporter or person, the latest receipts of fungible goods that add up to the amount of fungible goods in opening inventory;

(b) determining the origin of the fungible goods that make up those receipts; and

(c) considering the origin of those fungible goods to be the origin of the fungible goods in opening inventory.

(2) If the exporter or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in opening inventory, originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible goods is determined on the basis of the origin identifier.

(3) The exporter or person may consider all fungible goods in opening inventory to be non-originating goods.
