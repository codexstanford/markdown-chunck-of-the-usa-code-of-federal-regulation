###### Commercial fishing industry vessels.

(b)Where a commercial fishing industry vessel proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate port of call or actually engaged in fishing operations is subject to seizure for administrative forfeiture for a violation of law involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a summons to appear shall be issued in lieu of a physical seizure. The vessel shall report to the port designated in the summons no later than the date specified in the summons. When a commercial fishing industry vessel reports, the appropriate Customs officer shall, depending on the facts and circumstances, either issue another summons to appear at a time deemed appropriate, execute a constructive seizure agreement pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1605, or take physical custody of the vessel. When a summons to appear has been issued, the seizing agency may be authorized to institute administrative forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically seized. When a summons to appear has been issued, the owner or interested party may file a petition for expedited procedures pursuant to subsection (a); the provisions of subsection (a) and other provisions in this subpart relating to a petition for expedited release shall apply as if the vessel had been physically seized.
