###### Item 6-Date-

The date of the in-bond entry preparation. Since an in-bond entry can be prepared before the date of entry presentation and/or acceptance, and prior to the actual arrival of the importing conveyance, this date should only be used for duty assessment purposes when the date in Item 8 is left blank. If a date is not present, the date of in-bond preparation will be deemed to be the date of arrival.
