###### Procedure.

(a)In order to change the port of destination or the port of exportation of an in-bond movement, the filer of the in-bond application must submit a request to divert merchandise via a CBP-approved EDI system. Permission for the diversion and movement of merchandise will be transmitted via a CBP-approved EDI system. If the request to divert merchandise is denied, such merchandise must be delivered to the original port of destination or port of exportation that was named in the in-bond application. The decision to grant or deny permission to divert merchandise is within the discretion of CBP. Denials may result from, for example, restrictions placed upon the movement of goods by government agencies.
