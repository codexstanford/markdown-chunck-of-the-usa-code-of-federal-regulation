###### Supplementation of responses.

(e)A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the party's response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:

(1) A party is under a duty to seasonably supplement the party's response with respect to any question directly addressed to:

(i) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters; and

(ii) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at a hearing, the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify, and the substance of the testimony.

(2) A party is under a duty to seasonably amend a prior response if the party obtains information upon the basis of which the party:

(i) Knows the response was incorrect when made; or

(ii) Knows that the response, though correct when made, is no longer true, and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.

(3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the administrative law judge, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to a hearing through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.
