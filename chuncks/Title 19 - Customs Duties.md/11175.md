(f)The administrative law judge may order a party to answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or items, or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law judge may make any determination or enter any order in the proceedings as the administrative law judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The administrative law judge may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part, or may take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for purpose of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In issuing a discovery order, the administrative law judge will consider the necessity to protect proprietary information and will not order the release of information in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that such release will lead to unauthorized dissemination of such information.
