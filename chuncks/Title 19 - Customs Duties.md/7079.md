## Chapter I - U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security; Department of the Treasury

#### Appendix D to Part 171 - Guidelines for the Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1593a
##### Cooperation With the Investigation.

(b)To obtain the benefits of this factor, the alleged violator must exhibit cooperation beyond that expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation. An example of the cooperation contemplated includes assisting Customs officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the alleged violator (e.g., incurring extraordinary expenses in providing computer runs solely for submission to Customs to assist the agency in cases involving an unusually large number of entries and/or complex issues). Another example consists of assisting Customs in obtaining additional information relating to the subject violation or other violations. Merely providing the books and records of the alleged violator may not be considered cooperation justifying mitigation inasmuch as Customs has the right to examine an importer's books and records pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508-1509.
