(d)If the Center director has credible information that a type of rate or combination of types of rates not applicable to payment for the merchandise was required or permitted in payment of costs, charges, or expenses, the currency conversions for the exchange covering payment for the merchandise and for the exchange covering such costs, charges, or expenses shall be calculated separately. In deducting nondutiable costs, charges, or expenses, the foreign exchange shall be at the rate or rates actually used in payment of such costs, charges, or expenses, whether or not certified in accordance with § 159.34 or § 159.35.
