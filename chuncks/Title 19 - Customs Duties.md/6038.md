A "Commodity Group Brochure" is a booklet which contains a listing of laboratory methods which commercial laboratories are required to have the capability to perform to qualify for CBP-accreditation in a particular commodity group. The brochures and the Customs and Border Protection Laboratory (CBPL) Methods will specify the particular laboratory testing methods required for particular commodity groups, unless written permission from the Executive Director is given to use an alternate method. Procedures required by the Executive Director may reference applicable general industry testing standards, published by such organizations as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the American Petroleum Institute (API).
