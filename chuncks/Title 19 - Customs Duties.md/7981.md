### PART 182 - UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
#### Appendix A to Part 182 - Rules of Origin Regulations
##### i.e.,

(13) A high-wage assembly credit of five percentage points may be included in the LVC for heavy trucks produced by a producer that operates a high-wage assembly plant for heavy truck parts or has a long-term supply contract (a contract with a minimum of three years) for those parts with such a plant.

(14) A high-wage assembly plant for passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck parts need only have the capacity to produce the minimum amount of originating parts specified in the definition. There is no need to maintain or provide records or other documents that certify such parts are originating, as long as information demonstrating the capacity to produce these minimum amounts is maintained and can be provided.

(15) For the purpose of calculating the LVC of a passenger vehicle, light truck or heavy truck, the producer may elect to average the calculation using any one of the following categories, on the basis of either all vehicles in the category or only those vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of one or more of the other USMCA countries:

(a) The same model line of vehicles in the same class of vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a USMCA country;

(b) the same class of vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a USMCA country;

(c) the same model line of vehicles or same class of vehicles produced in the territory of a USMCA country;

(d) any other category as the USMCA countries may decide.

(16) An election made under subsection (15) must

(a) state the category chosen by the producer, and

(i) if the category referred to in paragraph (15)(a) is chosen, state the model line, model name, class of vehicle and tariff classification of the vehicles in that category, and the location of the plant at which the vehicles are produced,

(ii) if the category referred to in paragraph (15)(b) is chosen, state the model name, class of vehicle and tariff classification of the vehicles in that category, and the location of the plant at which the vehicles are produced, and

(iii) if the category referred to in paragraph (15)(c) is chosen, state the model line, model name, class of vehicle and tariff classification of the vehicles in that category, and the locations of the plants at which the vehicles are produced;

(b) state whether the basis of the calculation is all vehicles in the category or only those vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of one or more of the other USMCA countries;

(c) state the producer's name and address;

(d) state the period with respect to which the election is made, including the starting and ending dates;

(e) state the estimated labor value content of vehicles in the category on the basis stated under paragraph (b);

(f) be dated and signed by an authorized officer of the producer; and

(g) be filed with the customs administration of each USMCA country to which vehicles in that category are to be exported during the period covered by the election, by July 31, 2020, and subsequently at least 10 days before the first day of the producer's fiscal year, or such shorter period as that customs administration may accept.

(17) An election filed for the vehicles referred to in subsection (16) may not be

(a) rescinded; or

(b) modified with respect to the category or basis of calculation.

(18) For purposes of this section, if a producer files an election under paragraph (16)(a), it must include the labor value content and the net cost of the producer's passenger vehicles, light trucks or heavy trucks, calculated under one of the categories set out in subsection (15), with respect to

(a) all vehicles that fall within the category chosen by the producer, or

(b) those vehicles to be exported to the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries that fall within the category chosen by the producer.

(19) For the purposes of determining the LVC in this section, the producer may base the calculation on the following periods:

(a) The previous fiscal year of the producer;

(b) the previous calendar year;

(c) the quarter or month to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported;

(d) the producer's fiscal year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported; or

(e) the calendar year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported.

(20) High-wage transportation or related costs for shipping may be included in a producer's LVC calculation, if not included in the amount for high-wage materials. Alternatively, a producer may aggregate such costs within the territories of one or more of the USMCA countries. Based on this aggregate amount, the producer may attribute an amount for transportation or related costs for shipping for purposes of the LVC calculation. Transportation or related costs for shipping incurred in transporting a material from outside the territories of the USMCA countries to the territory of a USMCA country are not included in this calculation.

(21) The value of both originating and non-originating materials must be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the labor value content of a good. For greater certainty, the full value of a non-originating material that has undergone production in a qualifying-wage-rate production plant may be included in the HWM described in subsection 6.

(22) For the period ending July 1, 2027, if a producer certifies a Labor Value Content for a heavy truck that is higher than 45 percent by increasing the amount of high wage material and manufacturing expenditures above 30 percentage points, the producer may use the points above 30 percentage points as a credit towards the regional value content percentages under section 13, provided that the regional value content percentage is not below 60 percent.

(1) For the purposes of this section, eligible vehicles means passenger vehicles or light trucks for which an alternative staging regime has been approved by the USMCA countries.

(2) Notwithstanding sections 13 through 18, eligible vehicles are subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (4) from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2025, or any other period provided for in the producer's approved alternative staging regime. Eligible vehicles are also subject to any other applicable requirements established in these Regulations.

(3) Passenger vehicles or light trucks that are not eligible vehicles may qualify as originating under the rules of origin established in sections 13 through 18, and any other applicable requirements established in these Regulations.

(4) Eligible vehicles are considered originating if they meet the following requirements:

(a) A regional value content of not less than 62.5 percent, under the net cost method;

(b) for parts listed in Table A.1, except lithium ion batteries of subheading 8507.60, a regional value content of not less than:

(i) 62.5 percent where the net cost method is used; or

(ii) 72.5 percent where the transaction value method is used if the corresponding rule includes a transaction value method; and

(iii) for lithium-ion batteries of 8507.60, a change from within subheading 8507.60 or from any other subheading for lithium-ion batteries of 8507.60

(c) at least 70 percent of a vehicle producer's purchases of steel and at least 70 percent of a vehicle producer's purchases of aluminum, by value, must qualify as originating under the rules of origin established in Schedule I (PSRO Annex). This requirement will not apply to vehicle producers that have an exemption under an approved alternative staging regime from having to satisfy this requirement; and

(d) a labor value content of at least 25 percent, consisting of at least ten percentage points of high-wage material and manufacturing expenditures, no more than ten percentage points of high-wage technology expenditures, and no more than five percentage points of high-wage assembly expenditures.

(5) Eligible vehicles are exempt from the core parts requirement set out in section 14.

(6) All methods and calculations for the requirements applicable to eligible vehicles must be based on the applicable provisions in these Regulations.

(7) Vehicles that are presently covered under the alternative staging regime described in Article 403.6 of the NAFTA Agreement as of November 30, 2019, may continue to use this regime, including any regulations that were effect prior to entry into force of the USMCA, according to each USMCA country's approval process for use of the alternative staging regime. After the expiration of the period under the Article 403.6 alternative staging period, such vehicles will be eligible for preferential treatment under the requirements described in subsection (4), until the end of the USMCA alternative staging period described in subsection (2). For greater certainty, such vehicles will also be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the other rules of origin set forth in these regulations.

(1) The value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of other vehicles and parts thereof must not, for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good, include the value of non-originating materials used to produce originating materials that are subsequently used in the production of the good.

(2) Notwithstanding section 13 and Schedule I (PSRO Annex), the regional value content requirement is 62.5 percent under the net cost method for:

(a) A motor vehicle for the transport of 15 or fewer persons of subheading 8702.10 or 8702.90;

(b) a passenger vehicle with a compression-ignition engine as the primary motor of propulsion of subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90,

(c) a three or four-wheeled motorcycle of subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90,

(d) a motorhome or entertainer coach of subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90;

(e) an ambulance, a hearse, a prison van of subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90;

(f) a vehicle solely principally for off-road use of subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90; or

(g) a vehicle of subheading 8704.21 or 8704.31 that is solely or principally for off-road use; and

(h) a good of heading 84.07 or 84.08, or subheading 8708.40, that is for use in a motor vehicle in paragraphs (a) through (g).

(3) Notwithstanding section 13 and Schedule I (PSRO Annex), the regional value content requirement is 60 percent under the net cost method for:

(a) A good that is:

(i) A motor vehicle of heading 87.01, except for subheading 8701.20;

(ii) a motor vehicle for the transport of 16 or more persons of subheading 8702.10 or 8702.90;

(iii) a motor vehicle of subheading 8704.10;

(iv) a motor vehicle of subheading 8704.22, 8704.23, 8704.32, or 8704.90 that is solely or principally for off-road use;

(v) a motor vehicle of heading 87.05; or,

(vi) a good of heading 87.06 that is not for use in a passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck;

(b) a good of heading 84.07 or 84.08, or subheading 8708.40, that is for use in a motor vehicle in paragraph (3)(a); or

(c) except for a good in paragraph (3)(b) or of subheading 8482.10 through 8482.80, 8483.20, or 8483.30, a good in Table F that is subject to a regional value content requirement and that is for use in a motor vehicle in paragraphs (2)(a) through (g) or (3)(a).

(4) For the purpose of calculating the regional value content under the net cost method for a good that is a motor vehicle provided for in paragraphs (2)(a) through (g) or (3)(a), a good listed in Table F for use as original equipment in the production of a good in paragraphs (2)(a) through (g), or a component listed in Table G for use as original equipment in the production of the motor vehicle in paragraph (3)(a), the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good must be the sum of:

(a) For each material used by the producer listed in Table F or Table G, whether or not produced by the producer, at the choice of the producer and determined in accordance with section 7 (Regional Value Content), either

(i) the value of such material that is non-originating, or

(ii) the value of non-originating materials used in the production of such material; and

(b) the value of any other non-originating material used by the producer that is not listed in Table F or Table G, determined in accordance with section 7 (Regional Value Content).

(5) For greater certainty, notwithstanding subsection (4), for purposes of a good that is a motor vehicle provided for in paragraphs (2)(a) through (g) or (3)(a), the value of non-originating materials is the sum of the values of all non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the vehicle.

(6) For the purpose of calculating the regional value content of a motor vehicle covered by subsections (2) or (3), the producer may average its calculation over its fiscal year, using any one of the following categories, on the basis of either all motor vehicles in the category or only those motor vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of one or more of the other USMCA countries:

(a) The same model line of motor vehicles in the same class of vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a USMCA country;

(b) the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a USMCA country; or

(c) the same model line of motor vehicles produced in the territory of a USMCA country.

(7) For the purpose of calculating the regional value content for a good listed in Table F, or a component or material listed in Table G, produced in the same plant, the producer of the good may:

(a) Average its calculation:

(i) Over the fiscal year of the motor vehicle producer to whom the good is sold,

(ii) over any quarter or month, or

(iii) over its fiscal year, if the good is sold as an aftermarket part;

(b) calculate the average referred to in paragraph (a) separately for a good sold to one or more motor vehicle producers; or

(c) with respect to any calculation under this subsection, calculate the average separately for goods that are exported to the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries.

(8) The regional value content requirement for a motor vehicle identified in subsection (2) or (3) is:

(a) 50 percent for five years after the date on which the first motor vehicle prototype is produced in a plant by a motor vehicle assembler, if:

(i) It is a motor vehicle of a class, or marque, or, except for a motor vehicle identified in subsection (3), size category and underbody, not previously produced by the motor vehicle assembler in the territory of any of the USMCA countries,

(ii) the plant consists of a new building in which the motor vehicle is assembled, and

(iii) the plant contains substantially all new machinery that is used in the assembly of the motor vehicle; or

(b) 50 percent for two years after the date on which the first motor vehicle prototype is produced at a plant following a refit, if it is a different motor vehicle of a class, or marque, or, except for a motor vehicle identified in subsection (3), size category and underbody, that was assembled by the motor vehicle assembler in the plant before the refit.
