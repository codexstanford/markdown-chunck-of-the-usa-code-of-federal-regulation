###### Crib.

(a)A crib means a bonded area, separate from the storage area of a Class 9 warehouse, for the retention of a supply of articles for delivery to persons departing from the United States. It shall be located beyond the exit point, unless exception has been made under ยง 19.39 (a) and (b) of this part. The crib may be a permanent location or a mobile facility which is periodically moved to a location beyond the exit point. The quantity of goods in the crib may be an amount requested by the proprietor which is commercially necessary for the delivery operations for a period, if approved by the port director. The port director may increase or decrease the quantity as deemed necessary for the protection of the revenue and proper administration of U.S. laws and regulations, or may order the return to the storage area of goods remaining unsold.
