##### ยง 148.37 Replacement of unsatisfactory articles acquired abroad.
###### Articles found damaged upon declaration.

(c)The requirement that the original article be exported under CBP supervision does not apply when a duplicate article is furnished by a foreign supplier as a replacement for an article declared for entry under the $800 or $1,600 exemption and found by the CBP inspector or other examining officer to be so damaged as to constitute a nonimportation (ยง 158.11 of this chapter). In such a case, CBP Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, will be issued to the importer at the time the determination of nonimportation is made and the duplicate replacement will be considered to have been acquired abroad for the purposes of the $800 or $1,600 exemption provision, provided no charge is made to the importer for the duplicate replacement.
