(b)A surety may not disavow already incurred obligations but may, with or without the consent of the principal, terminate its agreement to accept future obligations on a bond. The surety must provide reasonable notice of termination, made pursuant to the methods set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, to both the Revenue Division or a drawback office, as appropriate, and to the principal. The notice must state the date on which the termination will be effective. Thirty days will constitute reasonable notice unless the surety can show to the satisfaction of CBP that a shorter time frame is reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
