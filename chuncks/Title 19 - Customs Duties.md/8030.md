##### Selected Interest Rates

(c) in the case of a producer located in the United States, the yield for federal government debt obligations set out in the Federal Reserve statistical release (H.15)

(i) if the interest rate is adjusted at intervals of less than one year, under the title "U.S. government securities, Treasury bills, Secondary market", and

(ii) in any other case, under the title "U.S. Government Securities, Treasury constant maturities", for the week that the producer entered into the contract or the week of the most recent interest rate adjustment date, if any, under the contract.

2. For purposes of calculating non-allowable interest costs

(a) with respect to a fixed-rate contract, the interest rate under that contract must be compared with the interest rate issued by the federal government debt obligations that have maturities of the same length as the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract (that yield determined by linear interpolation, if necessary);

(b) with respect to a variable-rate contract

(i) in which the interest rate is adjusted at intervals of less than or equal to one year, the interest rate under that contract must be compared with the interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities closest in length to the interest rate adjustment period of the contract, and

(ii) in which the interest rate is adjusted at intervals of greater than one year, the interest rate under the contract must be compared with the interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities of the same length as the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract (that yield determined by linear interpolation, if necessary); and

(c) with respect to a fixed-rate or variable-rate contract in which the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract is greater than the maturities offered on federal government debt obligations, the interest rate under the contract must be compared to the interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities closest in length to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract.
