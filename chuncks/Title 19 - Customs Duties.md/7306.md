(f)The filing of a petition under this procedure will not preclude the petitioner or any other person entitled to do so from filing a protest or a domestic interested party petition regarding the same matter under the procedures set forth in sections 514, 515 and 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended and parts 174 and 175 of this chapter, provided the applicable requirements set forth therein are complied with.
