Such commingled fuel must be accounted for in the same 24-hour period in which it was commingled and must be-

(1) Exported within that 24-hour period;

(2) Used under section 309 within that 24-hour period; or

(3) Entered or withdrawn for consumption, with duty deposited, as required under the applicable regulations (see part 144 of this chapter).
