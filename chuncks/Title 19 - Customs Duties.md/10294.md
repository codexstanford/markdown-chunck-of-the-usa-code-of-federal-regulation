##### ยง 351.204 Time periods and persons examined; voluntary respondents; exclusions.
###### Introduction.

(a)Because the Act does not specify the precise period of time that the Secretary should examine in an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation, this section sets forth rules regarding the period of investigation ("POI"). In addition, this section includes rules regarding the selection of persons to be examined, the treatment of voluntary respondents that are not selected for individual examination, and the exclusion of persons that the Secretary ultimately finds are not dumping or are not receiving countervailable subsidies.
