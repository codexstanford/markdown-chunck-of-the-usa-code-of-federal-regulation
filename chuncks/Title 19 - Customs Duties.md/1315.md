##### Origin Verifications and Determinations
###### ยง 10.743 Special rule for verifications in Australia of U.S. imports of textile and apparel goods.
####### Procedures to determine compliance with applicable customs laws and regulations of the U.S.

(b)For purposes of enabling CBP to determine that an exporter or producer is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, and procedures in cases in which CBP has a reasonable suspicion that an Australian exporter or producer is engaging in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile and apparel goods, CBP may request that the government of Australia conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. A "reasonable suspicion" for the purpose of this paragraph will be based on relevant factual information, including information of the type set forth in Article 6.5 of the AFTA, which indicates circumvention of applicable laws, regulations or procedures regarding trade in textile and apparel goods. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include suspending the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile and apparel goods exported or produced by the Australian entity where the reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity relates to those goods. If an exporter, producer, or other person refuses to consent to a visit as provided for in this paragraph, or if CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, or makes a negative determination, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include denying the application of preferential tariff treatment to any textile or apparel goods exported or produced by the entity subject to the verification.
