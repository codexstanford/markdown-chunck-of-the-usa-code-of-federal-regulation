##### ยง 162.95 Release of seized property.
###### Generally.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a claimant to seized property under 18 U.S.C. 983(a) is entitled to immediate release of the property if:

(1) The claimant has a possessory interest in the property;

(2) The claimant has sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will be available at the time of trial;

(3) The continued possession of the property by Customs pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing an individual from working, or leaving an individual homeless; and

(4) The claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by Customs of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceedings.
