###### Samples.

(3)Each request for an advance ruling should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations of the good and, whenever possible, by a sample of the good unless a precise description of the good is not essential to the advance ruling requested. Any good consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis, flow charts, CAS number, and related information. A sample submitted in connection with a request for an advance ruling becomes a part of the CBP file in the matter and will be retained until the advance ruling is issued or the advance ruling request is otherwise disposed of. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the advance ruling request.
