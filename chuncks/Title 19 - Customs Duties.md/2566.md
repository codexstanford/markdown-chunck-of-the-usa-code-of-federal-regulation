###### Quantity.

(iv)The quantity of the cargo laden aboard the conveyance must be provided. This means the quantity of the smallest external packing unit. Containers and pallets do not constitute acceptable information. For example, a container holding 10 pallets with 200 cartons should be described as 200 cartons. If the reported quantity is not correct or if it changes, the in-bond record must be updated or amended in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The updating of the quantity of the merchandise does not relieve the carrier whose bond is obligated from liquidated damages for any shortage.
