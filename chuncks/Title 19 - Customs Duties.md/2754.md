###### Discontinuance of FIFO.

(9)A proprietor may voluntarily discontinue the use of FIFO procedures for all or part of the merchandise currently under FIFO by providing written notification to the port director. The notification must clearly describe the merchandise, by commercial names and unique identifiers, to be removed from FIFO. Following notification, the merchandise must be segregated in both the recordkeeping system and the physical location by warehouse entry number and the quantities so removed must be deducted from the appropriate FIFO inventory category balances. Merchandise so removed must be maintained under the specific identification inventory method. FIFO procedures which were voluntarily discontinued may be reinstated, but not for merchandise covered by any warehouse entry for which FIFO was discontinued.
