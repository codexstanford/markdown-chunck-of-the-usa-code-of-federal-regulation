The imported merchandise which the manufacturer or producer will designate on its claims will be so similar in quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which drawback is claimed that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.

See the General Instructions, I.A.7., for this general drawback ruling. Each article to be exported must be named. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name, there must be a statement as to what the product is, e.g., a herbicide.

The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).

Heated crude oil is charged to an atmospheric distillation tower where it is subjected to fractionation. The charge to the distillation tower consists of a single crude oil, or of commingled crudes which are fed to the tower simultaneously or after blending in a tank. During fractionation, components of different boiling ranges are separated.

Fractionation results in 17 products. In order to insure proper distribution of drawback to each of these products, the manufacturer or producer agrees to record the relative values as the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract is to be treated at the time of separation. The value per unit of each product shall be the average market value for the abstract period.

The manufacturer or producer can vary the proportionate quantity of each product. The manufacturer or producer understands that drawback is payable on exported products only to the extent that these products could have been produced from the designated merchandise. The records of the manufacturer or producer will show that all of the products exported for which drawback will be claimed under this general manufacturing drawback ruling could have been produced concurrently on a practical operating basis from the designated merchandise.

The manufacturer or producer agrees to establish the amount to be designated by reference to the Industry Standards of Potential Production published in T.D. 66-16.

There are no valuable wastes as a result of the processing.

Because the manufacturer or producer keeps records on a volume basis rather than a weight basis, it is anticipated that the material balance will show a volume gain. For the same reason, it is possible that occasionally the material balance will show a volume loss. Fluctuations in type of crude used, together with the type of finished product desired make an estimate of an average volume gain meaningless. However, records will be kept to show the amount of loss or gain with respect to the production of export products.

The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.

Records will be maintained to establish:

1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise designated;

2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise used to produce the exported articles.

3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at its refinery, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced the exported articles.

4(a). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use a 28-31 day period (monthly) abstract period for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling, or

(b). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use an abstract period (not to exceed 1 year) for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer certifies that if it were to file abstracts covering each manufacturing period of not less than 28 days and not more than 31 days (monthly) within the longer period, in no such monthly abstract would the quantity of designated merchandise exceed, for the same class of designated merchandise, the material introduced into the manufacturing process during that monthly period. (Select (a) or (b), and state which is selected in the application, and, if (b) is selected, specify the length of the particular abstract period chosen (not to exceed 1 year (see General Instruction I.A.7.)).)

5. On each abstract of production the manufacturer or producer agrees to show the value per barrel to five decimal places.

6. The manufacturer or producer agrees to file claims in the format set forth in exhibits A through F which are attached to this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer realizes that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. It is understood that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance. Records will be kept in accordance with T.D. 84-49, as amended by T.D. 95-61.

It is understood that the refiner can reserve as the basis for future payment the right to drawback only on the number of barrels of raw material computed by subtracting from Line E the larger of Lines A or B, of a given Exhibit E. It is further understood that this right to future payment can be claimed only against products concurrently producible with the products listed in Column 21, in the quantities shown in Column 22 of such Exhibit E. Such residual right can be transferred to another refinery of the same refiner only when Line B of Exhibit E is larger than Line A. Unless the number of residual barrels is specifically computed and rights thereto are expressly reserved on Exhibit E, such residual rights shall be deemed waived. The procedure the manufacturer or producer shall follow in preparing drawback entries claiming this residual right is illustrated in the attached sample Exhibit E-1. It is understood that claims involving residual rights shall be filed only at the port where the Exhibit E reserving such right was filed.

The manufacturer or producer realizes that inventory control is of major importance. In accordance with the normal accounting procedures of the manufacturer or producer, each refinery prepares a monthly stock and yield report, which accounts for inventories, production and disposals from time of receipt to time of disposition. This provides an audit trail of all products.

The above-noted records will provide the required audit trail from the initial source documents to the drawback claims of the manufacturer or producer and will support adherence with the requirements discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED.

The amount of raw material on which drawback may be based shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of each product exported by the drawback factor for that product. The amount of any one type and class of raw material which may be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products produced at a given refinery and covered by a drawback entry shall not exceed the quantity of such raw material used at the refinery during the abstract period or periods from which the exported products were produced. The quantity of raw material to be designated as the basis for drawback on exported products must be at least as great as the quantity of raw material of the same type and class which would be required to produce the exported products in the quantities exported.

The manufacturer or producer specifically agrees that it will:

1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;

2. Open its refinery and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;

3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;

4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;

5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and

6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.

The piece goods used in manufacture will be the same kind and quality as the piece goods designated as the basis of claim for drawback, and are used interchangeably without change in manufacturing processes or resultant products (including, if applicable, multiple products), or wastes. Some tolerances between imported-designated piece goods and the used-exported piece goods will be permitted to accommodate variations which are normally found in piece goods. These tolerances are no greater than the tolerances generally allowed in the industry for piece goods of the same kind and quality as follows:

1. A 4% weight tolerance so that the piece goods used in manufacture will be not more than 4% lighter or heavier than the imported piece goods which will be designated;
