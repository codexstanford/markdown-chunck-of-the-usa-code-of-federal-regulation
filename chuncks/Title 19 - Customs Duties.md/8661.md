###### Example.

(D)In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals, and with an established average inventory turn-over period of 30 days), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the preceding 30 days with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $101.50 (the January 20 and January 25 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $51.50 (the February 20 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). No drawback may be claimed on the basis of the January 5 receipt or the February 25 receipt because in the case of each, there were insufficient withdrawals for export within the established average inventory turn-over period; the 50 units remaining from the January 2 receipt after the January 15 withdrawal are not identified for a withdrawal for export because there is no other withdrawal for export (other than the January 15 withdrawal) within the established average inventory turn-over period; the March 20 receipt (50 units at $1.08) is not yet attributed to withdrawals for export. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $341.00.
