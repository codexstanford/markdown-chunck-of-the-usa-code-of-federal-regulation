### PART 182 - UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
#### Appendix A to Part 182 - Rules of Origin Regulations
##### rolling average method

means the method by which the value of non-originating materials used in the production of a good that is shipped to the buyer of the good is based on the average value, calculated in accordance with section 4, of the non-originating materials in materials inventory.

2 For purposes of subsections 5(13) and (14) and 7(10) of these Regulations, the following are the methods for determining the value of non-originating materials that are identical materials and are used in the production of a good:

(a) FIFO method;

(b) LIFO method; and

(c) rolling average method.

3 (1) If a producer of a good chooses, with respect to non-originating materials that are identical materials, any of the methods referred to in section 2, the producer may not use another of those methods with respect to any other non-originating materials that are identical materials and that are used in the production of that good or in the production of any other good.

(2) If a producer of a good produces the good in more than one plant, the method chosen by the producer must be used with respect to all plants of the producer in which the good is produced.

(3) The method chosen by the producer to determine the value of non-originating materials may be chosen at any time during the producer's fiscal year and may not be changed during that fiscal year.

4 (1) The average value of non-originating materials that are identical materials and that are used in the production of a good that is shipped to the buyer of the good is calculated by dividing:

(a) The total value of non-originating materials that are identical materials in materials inventory prior to the shipment of the good, determined in accordance with section 8 of these Regulations, by

(b) the total units of those non-originating materials in materials inventory prior to the shipment of the good.

(2) The average value calculated under subsection (1) is applied to the remaining units of non-originating materials in materials inventory.

The following examples are based on the figures set out in the table below and on the following assumptions:

(a) Materials A are non-originating materials that are identical materials that are used in the production of Good A;

(b) one unit of Materials A is used to produce one unit of Good A;

(c) all other materials used in the production of Good A are originating materials; and

(d) Good A is produced in a single plant.
