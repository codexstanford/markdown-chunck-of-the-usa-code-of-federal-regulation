(b)For purposes of determining whether the country of origin of textiles and textile products subject to the provisions of ยง 102.21 or ยง 102.22 of this chapter, as applicable, has been accurately represented to CBP, the release from CBP custody of any such textile or textile product shall be deemed conditional during the 180-day period following the date of release.
