###### Procedures required.

(b)Each duty-free store must establish, maintain, and follow written procedures to provide reasonable assurance to the port director that conditionally duty-free merchandise purchased therein will be exported from the customs territory. A copy of any change in the procedure will be provided to the port director before it is implemented. However, receipt by CBP of the procedures of any change thereto must not be construed as approval by CBP of the procedures. The port director is responsible for ensuring that each enterprise has established guidelines with CBP and is complying with those guidelines, giving assurance that proper supervision exists when delivery is made to the purchaser at or before the exit point. The port director may at any time require any change in the procedures deemed necessary for assurance of exportation.
