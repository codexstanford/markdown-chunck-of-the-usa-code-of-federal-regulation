####### Time for response.

(a)Except as provided in § 210.59(a) and unless otherwise ordered in the notice of investigation or by the administrative law judge, respondents shall have 20 days from the date of service of the complaint and notice of investigation, by the Commission under § 210.11(a) or by a party under § 210.11(b), within which to file a written response to the complaint and the notice of investigation. When the investigation involves a motion for temporary relief and has not been declared "more complicated," the response to the complaint and notice of investigation must be filed along with the response to the motion for temporary relief-i.e., within 10 days after service of the complaint, notice of investigation, and the motion for temporary relief by the Commission under § 210.11(a) or by a party under § 210.11(b). (See § 210.59.)
