###### Cargo information from air carrier.

(1)The incoming air carrier must present to CBP the following data elements for inbound air cargo (an "M" next to any listed data element indicates that the data element is mandatory in all cases; a "C" next to the listed data element indicates that the data element is conditional and must be transmitted to CBP only if the particular information pertains to the inbound cargo; and an "A" next to any listed data element indicates that the data element is an ACAS data element that is also subject to the requirements and time frame specified in ยง 122.48b):

(i) Air waybill number (M) (A) (The air waybill number is the International Air Transport Association (IATA) standard 11-digit number);

(ii) Trip/flight number (M);

(iii) Carrier/ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) code (M) (The approved electronic data interchange system supports both 3- and 2-character ICAO codes, provided that the final digit of the 2-character code is not a numeric value);

(iv) Airport of arrival (M) (The 3-alpha character ICAO code corresponding to the first airport of arrival in the Customs territory of the United States (for example, Chicago O'Hare = ORD; Los Angeles International Airport = LAX));

(v) Airport of origin (M) (The 3-alpha character ICAO code corresponding to the airport from which a shipment began its transportation by air to the United States (for example, if a shipment began its transportation from Hong Kong (HKG), and it transits through Narita, Japan (NRT), en route to the United States, the airport of origin is HKG, not NRT));

(vi) Scheduled date of arrival (M);

(vii) Total quantity based on the smallest external packing unit (M) (A) (for example, 2 pallets containing 50 pieces each would be considered as 100, not 2);

(viii) Total weight (M) (A) (may be expressed in either pounds or kilograms);

(ix) Precise cargo description (M) (A) (for consolidated shipments, the word "Consolidation" is a sufficient description for the master air waybill record; for non-consolidated shipments, a precise cargo description or the 6-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number must be provided (generic descriptions, specifically those such as "FAK" ("freight of all kinds"), "general cargo", and "STC" ("said to contain") are not acceptable));

(x) Shipper name and address (M) (A) (for consolidated shipments, the identity of the consolidator, express consignment or other carrier, is sufficient for the master air waybill record; for non-consolidated shipments, the name of the foreign vendor, supplier, manufacturer, or other similar party is acceptable (and the address of the foreign vendor, etc., must be a foreign address); by contrast, the identity of a carrier, freight forwarder or consolidator is not acceptable);

(xi) Consignee name and address (M) (A) (for consolidated shipments, the identity of the container station (see 19 CFR 19.40-19.49), express consignment or other carrier is sufficient for the master air waybill record; for non-consolidated shipments, the name and address of the party to whom the cargo will be delivered is required regardless of the location of the party; this party need not be located at the arrival or destination port);

(xii) Consolidation identifier (C);

(xiii) Split shipment indicator (C) (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the specific data elements that must be presented to CBP in the case of a split shipment);

(xiv) Permit to proceed information (C) (this element includes the permit-to-proceed destination airport (the 3-alpha character ICAO code corresponding to the permit-to-proceed destination airport); and the scheduled date of arrival at the permit-to-proceed destination airport);

(xv) Identifier of other party which is to submit additional air waybill information (C);

(xvi) In-bond information (C) (this data element includes the destination airport; the international/domestic identifier (the in-bond type indicator); the in-bond control number, if there is one (C); and the onward carrier identifier, if applicable (C));

(xvii) Local transfer facility (C) (this facility is a Container Freight Station as identified by its FIRMS code, or the warehouse of another air carrier as identified by its carrier code); and

(xviii) Flight departure message (M) (this data element includes the liftoff date and liftoff time using the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)/Universal Time, Coordinated (UTC) at the time of departure from each foreign airport en route to the United States; if an aircraft en route to the United States stops at one or more foreign airports and cargo is loaded on board, the flight departure message must be provided for each departure).
