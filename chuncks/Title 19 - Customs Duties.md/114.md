#### Landing and Delivery of Cargo
##### ยง 4.34 Prematurely discharged, overcarried, and undelivered cargo.
###### Prematurely landed cargo.

(a)Upon receipt of a satisfactory written application from the owner or agent of a vessel establishing that cargo was prematurely landed and left behind by the importing vessel through error or emergency, the port director may permit inward foreign cargo remaining on the dock to be reladen on the next available vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel for transportation to the destination shown on the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of the first vessel, provided the importing vessel actually entered the port of destination of the prematurely landed cargo. Unless so forwarded within 30 days from the date of landing, the cargo shall be appropriately entered for Customs clearance or for forwarding in bond; otherwise, it shall be sent to general order as unclaimed. If the merchandise is so entered for Customs clearance at the port of unlading, or if it is so forwarded in bond, other than by the importing vessel or by another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel, representatives of the importing vessel shall file at the port of unlading a Cargo Declaration in duplicate listing the cargo. The port director shall retain the original and forward the duplicate to the director of the originally intended port of discharge.
