### PART 24 - CUSTOMS FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE
#### ยง 24.5 Filing identification number.
##### Optional additional identification.

(d)Customs Form 5106 contains blocks for a two-digit suffix code which may be written in as an addition to the Internal Revenue Service employer identification number to provide optional additional identification. The two-digit suffix code may be used by a business firm having branch office operations to permit the firm to identify transactions originating in its branch offices, or by vessel owners to permit them to identify transactions associated with particular vessels. A separate Customs Form 5106 shall be required to report the specific suffix code and the name and address for each branch office or vessel to be identified. Transactions may be associated with a specific branch office or vessel by reporting the appropriate identification number, including the two-digit suffix code, on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or the request for services. Suffix codes may be either numeric, alphabetic, or a combination of both numeric and alphabetic, except that the letters O, Z, and I may not be used. The blocks may be left blank if the firm or vessel owner has no use for them and a "00" suffix will be automatically assigned.
