##### ยง 177.9 Effect of ruling letters.
###### Effect of ruling letters generally.

(a)A ruling letter issued by the Customs Service under the provisions of this part represents the official position of the Customs Service with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs Service personnel in accordance with the provisions of this section until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the ruling set forth in the ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances. Generally, a ruling letter is effective on the date it is issued and may be applied to all entries which are unliquidated, or other transactions with respect to which the Customs Service has not taken final action on that date. See, however, ยง 177.10(e) (changes of practice published in the) and ยง 177.12 (rulings which modify or revoke previous rulings, decisions, or treatments).
