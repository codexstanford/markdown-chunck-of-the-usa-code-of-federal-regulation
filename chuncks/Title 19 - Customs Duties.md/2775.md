##### ยง 19.17 Application to establish warehouse; bond.
###### Statement of inventory and bond charges.

(g)Where two or more smelting or refining warehouses are included under one blanket smelting and refining bond, an overall statement must be prepared and maintained by the principal named in the bond by the 28th of each month, showing the inventory as of the close of the preceding month, of all metals on hand at each plant covered by the blanket bond and the total of bonded charges for all plants. If the warehouses covered by an overall statement are located in more than one port, each port director may choose to verify the accuracy of the inventory report only with respect to that portion of the report that relates to amounts held at a plant that is located within that port director's jurisdiction. All discrepancies which cannot be reconciled by the port director shall be reported to Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service. If Headquarters finds that the aggregate quantity of dutiable metal at the several plants does not equal the quantity charged against the blanket bond, duties shall be collected for the quantity determined to be deficient.
