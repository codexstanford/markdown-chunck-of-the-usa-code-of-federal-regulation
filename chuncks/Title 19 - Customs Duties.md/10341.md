###### Introduction.

(a)In addition to the imposition of duties, the Act also permits the Secretary to suspend an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation by accepting a suspension agreement (referred to in the WTO Agreements as an "undertaking"). Briefly, in a suspension agreement, the exporters and producers or the foreign government agree to modify their behavior so as to eliminate dumping or subsidization or the injury caused thereby. If the Secretary accepts a suspension agreement, the Secretary will "suspend" the investigation and thereafter will monitor compliance with the agreement. This section contains rules for entering into suspension agreements and procedures for suspending an investigation.
