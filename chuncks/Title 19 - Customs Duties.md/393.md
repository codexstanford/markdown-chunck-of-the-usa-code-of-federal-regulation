####### Combining, packaging, and diluting operations.

(2)No article which has undergone only a simple combining or packaging operation or a mere dilution in a beneficiary developing country within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be entitled to duty-free treatment even though the processing operation causes the article to meet the value requirement set forth in that paragraph. For purposes of this section:

(i) Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution include, but are not limited to, the following:

(A) The addition of batteries to devices;

(B) Fitting together a small number of components by bolting, glueing, soldering, etc.;

(C) Blending foreign and beneficiary developing country tobacco;

(D) The addition of substances such as anticaking agents, preservatives, wetting agents, etc.;

(E) Repacking or packaging components together;

(F) Reconstituting orange juice by adding water to orange juice concentrate; and

(G) Diluting chemicals with inert ingredients to bring them to standard degrees of strength;

(ii) Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution will not be taken to include processes such as the following:

(A) The assembly of a large number of discrete components onto a printed circuit board;

(B) The mixing together of two bulk medicinal substances followed by the packaging of the mixed product into individual doses for retail sale;

(C) The addition of water or another substance to a chemical compound under pressure which results in a reaction creating a new chemical compound; and

(D) A simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution coupled with any other type of processing such as testing or fabrication (for example, a simple assembly of a small number of components, one of which was fabricated in the beneficiary developing country where the assembly took place); and

(iii) The fact that an article has undergone more than a simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution is not necessarily dispositive of the question of whether that processing constitutes a substantial transformation for purposes of determining the country of origin of the article.

(b) [Reserved]
