###### Retention of cargo on board for later return to the United States.

(d)If, as the result of a strike or other emergency at a United States port for which inward foreign cargo is manifested, it is desired to retain the cargo on board the vessel for discharge at a foreign port but with the purpose of having the cargo returned to the United States, an application may be made by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel to amend the vessel's Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, under a procedure similar to that described in paragraph (c) of this section, except that a foreign port shall be substituted for the domestic port of discharge. If the application is approved, it shall be handled in the same manner as an application filed under paragraph (c) of this section. However, before approving the application, the port director is authorized to require such bond as he deems necessary to insure that export control laws and regulations are not circumvented.
