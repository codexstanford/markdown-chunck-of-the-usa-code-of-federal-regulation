###### Effect of noncompliance.

(C)If an importer fails to submit to CBP the declaration of compliance required under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section within 30 days following the end of the applicable one-year period during which the increased value-content percentage was met for apparel articles of a producer or entity controlling production, CBP may deny duty-free treatment to all apparel articles, as described in ยง 10.843(a) of this subpart, of that producer or entity controlling production that are entered by that importer during the next succeeding applicable one-year period. Additionally, the timely submission of a declaration of compliance is a prerequisite for a producer or entity controlling production to request retroactive application of duty-free treatment under ยง 10.845 of this subpart for apparel articles that meet the increased value-content percentage during an applicable one-year period. However, the submission of a declaration of compliance is not a substitute for filing a request for liquidation or reliquidation of an entry for which retroactive duty-free treatment is sought under ยง 10.845 of this subpart.
