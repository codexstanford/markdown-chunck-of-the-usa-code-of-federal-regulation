##### seller

refers to a person who sells the material being valued to the producer.

2 (1) Except as provided under subsection (2), the transaction value of a material under paragraph 8(1)(b) of these Regulations is the price actually paid or payable for the material determined in accordance with section 3 and adjusted in accordance with section 4.

(2) There is no transaction value for a material if the material is not the subject of a sale.

(3) The transaction value of a material is unacceptable if:

(a) there are restrictions on the disposition or use of the material by the producer, other than restrictions that

(i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer of the good or the seller of the material is located,

(ii) limit the geographical area in which the material may be used, or

(iii) do not substantially affect the value of the material;

(b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the material;

(c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal or use of the material by the producer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or payable cannot be made in accordance with paragraph 4(1)(d); or

(d) the producer and the seller are related persons and the relationship between them influenced the price actually paid or payable for the material.

(4) The cases or considerations referred to in paragraph (3)(b) include the following:

(a) the seller establishes the price actually paid or payable for the material on condition that the producer will also buy other materials or goods in specified quantities;

(b) the price actually paid or payable for the material is dependent on the price or prices at which the producer sells other materials or goods to the seller of the material; and

(c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the material, such as where the material is a semi-finished material that is provided by the seller to the producer on condition that the seller will receive a specified quantity of the finished material from the producer.

(5) For purposes of paragraph (3)(b), conditions or considerations relating to the use of the material will not render the transaction value unacceptable, such as where the producer undertakes on the producer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller, activities relating to the warranty of the material used in the production of a good.

(6) If objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection 4(1), the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of subsection 2(1). For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a litre of a particular good that is produced by using a material that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased material and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that material, such as when the purchased material is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the seller and the producer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the material could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased material and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.

3 (1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money. It may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly to the seller. For an illustration of this, the settlement by the producer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, is an indirect payment.

(2) Activities undertaken by the producer on the producer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 4, must not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities might be regarded as being for the benefit of the seller.

(3) The transaction value must not include charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the use of the material by the producer, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable.

(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the producer to the seller that do not relate to the purchase of the material are not part of the transaction value.

4 (1) In determining the transaction value of the material, the following must be added to the price actually paid or payable:

(a) To the extent that they are incurred by the producer with respect to the material being valued and are not included in the price actually paid or payable,

(i) commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions, and

(ii) the costs of containers which, for customs purposes, are classified with the material under the Harmonized System;

(b) the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection (13), of the following elements if they are supplied directly or indirectly to the seller by the producer free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the material, to the extent that the value is not included in the price actually paid or payable:

(i) A material, other than an indirect material, used in the production of the material being valued,

(ii) tools, dies, mold and similar indirect materials used in the production of the material being valued,
