###### Applicability of time frames.

(2)The time periods in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for reporting required EEI to CBP for outward vessel, air, truck, or rail cargo only apply to shipments without an export license, license exemption, or license exception that require full predeparture reporting of shipment data, in order to comply with the advance cargo information filing requirements under section 343(a), Trade Act of 2002, as amended. Requirements placed on exports controlled by other government agencies will remain in force unless changed by the agency having the regulatory authority to do so. CBP will also continue to require 72-hour advance notice for used vehicle exports pursuant to ยง 192.2(c)(1) and (c)(2)(i). The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent should refer to the relevant titles of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for pre-filing requirements of other government agencies. In particular, for the advance reporting requirements for exports of U.S. Munitions List items, see the U.S. Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130).
