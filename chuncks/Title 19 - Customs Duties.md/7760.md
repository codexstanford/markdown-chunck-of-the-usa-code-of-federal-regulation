##### ยง 182.124 Framework for correcting claims or certifications of origin.
###### Statement.

(c)For purposes of this part, each corrected claim or certification of origin must be accompanied by a statement, submitted in writing or via a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system, which:

(1) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect claim or certification of origin relates;

(2) In the case of a corrected claim or certification of origin by an importer, identifies each affected import transaction, including each port of importation and the approximate date of each importation;

(3) In the case of a written notification of an incorrect certification of origin by an exporter or producer, identifies each affected export transaction, including each port of exportation and the approximate date of each exportation. A producer who provides written notification that certain information in a certification of origin is incorrect and who is unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph must provide as much information concerning those transactions as the producer, by the exercise of good faith and due diligence, is able to obtain;

(4) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the claim or certification of origin; and

(5) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the claim or certification of origin, and states that the person will provide any additional information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected claim or certification of origin within 30 days or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.
