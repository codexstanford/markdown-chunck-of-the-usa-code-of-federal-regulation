No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, records will be maintained to establish the value, quantity, and disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records will be maintained to establish that fact.

Records, which may include records kept in the normal course of business, will be maintained to establish:

1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of the imported merchandise; and

2. The quantity of imported merchandiseused in producing the exported articles.

To obtain drawback, the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer must show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading "Procedures and Records Maintained". If those records do not establish compliance with all legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid. Each lot of imported material received by a manufacturer or producer must be given a lot number and kept separate from other lots until used. The records of the manufacturer or producer must show, as to each manufacturing lot or period of manufacture, the 8-digit HTSUS classification, the quantity of material used from each imported lot, and the number of each kind and size of bags or meat wrappers obtained.

All bags or meat wrappers manufactured or produced for the account of the same exporter during a specified period may be designated as one manufacturing lot. All exported bags or meat wrappers must be identified by the exporter.

Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible merchandise that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation, and records are kept which establish the quantity and value of the waste, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible material used to produce the exported articles, less the amount of that merchandise which the value of the waste would replace.

The manufacturer or producer must:

1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;

2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;

3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of liquidation of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;
