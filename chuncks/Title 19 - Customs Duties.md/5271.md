###### Statement processing.

(p)"Statement processing" means the method of collection and accounting which allows a filer to pay for more than one entry summary with one payment. ACS, or any other CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system, generates the statement, which is transmitted electronically to the filer, consisting of a list of entry summaries and the amount of duties, taxes or fees, if any, due for payment. Upon payment and collection of the statement, those entry summaries designated as electronic will be scheduled for liquidation (see ยง 24.25 of this chapter).
