##### Fee collection procedures.

(4)(i) Each air or sea carrier, travel agent, tour wholesaler, or other party issuing a ticket or travel document for transportation into the customs territory of the United States is responsible for collecting from the passenger the applicable fee specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, including the fee applicable to any infant traveling without a separate ticket or travel document. The fee must be separately identified with a notation "Federal inspection fees" on the ticket or travel document issued to the passenger to indicate that the required fee has been collected. A fee relative to an infant traveling without a ticket or travel document may be identified instead with the notation on a receipt or other document issued for that purpose or to record the infant's travel. If the ticket or travel document, or a receipt or other document issued relative to an infant traveling without a ticket or travel document, is not so marked and was issued in a foreign country, the fee must be collected by the departing carrier upon departure of the passenger from the United States. If the fee is collected at the time of departure from the United States, the carrier making the collection must issue a receipt to the passenger. U.S.-based tour wholesalers who contract for passenger space and issue non-carrier tickets or travel documents must collect the fee in the same manner as a carrier.

(ii) Collection of the fee under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section will include the following circumstances:

(A) When a through ticket or travel document is issued covering (or a receipt or other document issued for an infant traveling without a ticket or travel document indicates that the infant's journey is covering) a journey into the customs territory of the United States which originates in and arrives from a place outside the United States other than one of the territories and possessions of the United States;

(B) When a return ticket or travel document is issued (or a receipt or other document that indicates an infant traveling without a return ticket or travel document is issued) in connection with a journey which originates in the United States, includes a stop in a place other than one of the territories and possessions of the United States and the return arrival to the United States is from a place other than the territories and possessions of the United States; and

(C) When a passenger on a journey through the United States to a foreign destination arrives in the customs territory of the United States from a place other than one of the territories or possessions of the United States, is processed by CBP, and the journey does not originate in the territories and possessions of the United States.

(iii) Collection of the fee under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section will include the following circumstances:
