###### Determination of commercial interchangeability.

(c)In determining commercial interchangeability, Customs shall evaluate the critical properties of the substituted merchandise and in that evaluation factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, Governmental and recognized industrial standards, part numbers, tariff classification and value. A party may seek a nonbinding predetermination of commercial interchangeability directly from the appropriate drawback office. A determination of commercial interchangeability can be obtained in one of two ways:

(1) A formal ruling from the Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade; or

(2) A submission of all the required documentation necessary to make a commercial interchangeability determination with each individual drawback claim filed.
