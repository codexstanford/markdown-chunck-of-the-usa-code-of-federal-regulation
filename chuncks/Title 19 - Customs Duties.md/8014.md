### PART 182 - UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
#### Appendix A to Part 182 - Rules of Origin Regulations
##### origin identifier

means any mark that identifies fungible materials as originating materials or non-originating materials.

2 The following inventory management methods may be used for determining whether fungible materials referred to in paragraph 8(18)(a) of these Regulations are:

(a) Specific identification method;

(b) FIFO method;

(c) LIFO method; and

(d) average method.

3 A producer of a good, or a person from whom the producer acquired the fungible materials that are used in the production of the good, may choose only one of the inventory management methods referred to in section 2, and, if the averaging method is chosen, only one averaging period in each fiscal year of that producer or person for the materials inventory.

4 (1) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (2), if the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the specific identification method, the producer or person must physically segregate, in materials inventory, originating materials that are fungible materials from non-originating materials that are fungible materials.

(2) If originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials are marked with an origin identifier, the producer or person need not physically segregate those materials under subsection (1) if the origin identifier remains visible throughout the production of the good.

5 If the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the average method, the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory that is calculated under sections 6 through 8.

6 (1) Except as otherwise provided in sections 7 and 8, the ratio is calculated with respect to a month or three-month period, at the choice of the producer or person, by dividing

(a) the sum of

(i) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and

(ii) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period, by

(b) the sum of

(i) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and

(ii) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period.

(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding month or three-month period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory at the end of the preceding month or three-month period.

7 (1) If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and the regional value content is calculated under the net cost method and the producer or person chooses to average over a period under subsections 7(15), 16(1) or (10) of these Regulations, the ratio is calculated with respect to that period by dividing

(a) the sum of

(i) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the period, and

(ii) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that period, by

(b) the sum of

(i) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the period, and

(ii) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that period.

(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory at the end of the period.

8 (1) If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and the regional value content of that good is calculated under the transaction value method or the net cost method, the ratio is calculated with respect to each shipment of the good by dividing

(a) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment, by

(b) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment.

(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a shipment of a good under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory after the shipment.

9 (1) Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), if the producer or person referred to in section 3 has fungible materials in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible materials is determined by

(a) identifying, in the books of the producer or person, the latest receipts of fungible materials that add up to the amount of fungible materials in opening inventory;

(b) identifying the origin of the fungible materials that make up those receipts; and

(c) considering the origin of those fungible materials to be the origin of the fungible materials in opening inventory.

(2) If the producer or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in opening inventory, originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible materials is determined on the basis of the origin identifier.

(3) The producer or person may consider all fungible materials in opening inventory to be non-originating materials.
