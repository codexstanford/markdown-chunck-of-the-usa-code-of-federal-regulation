###### ยง 10.743 Special rule for verifications in Australia of U.S. imports of textile and apparel goods.
####### Procedures to determine whether a claim of origin is accurate.

(a)For the purpose of determining that a claim of origin for a textile or apparel good is accurate, CBP may request that the government of Australia conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include suspending the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile or apparel good for which a claim of origin has been made. If an exporter, producer, or other person refuses to consent to a visit as provided for in this paragraph, or if CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, or CBP makes a negative determination, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include denying the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile or apparel good subject to the verification, and to similar goods exported or produced by the entity that exported or produced the good.
