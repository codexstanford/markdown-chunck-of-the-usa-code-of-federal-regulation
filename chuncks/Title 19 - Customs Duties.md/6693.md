#### ยง 163.2 Persons required to maintain records.
##### Domestic transactions.

(b)For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a person who orders merchandise from an importer in a domestic transaction knowingly causes merchandise to be imported only if:

(1) The terms and conditions of the importation are controlled by the person placing the order with the importer (for example, the importer is not an independent contractor but rather is the agent of the person placing the order: Whereas a consumer who purchases an imported automobile from a domestic dealer would not be required to maintain records, a transit authority that prepared detailed specifications from which imported subway cars or busses were manufactured would be required to maintain records); or

(2) Technical data, molds, equipment, other production assistance, material, components, or parts are furnished by the person placing the order with the importer with knowledge that they will be used in the manufacture or production of the imported merchandise.
