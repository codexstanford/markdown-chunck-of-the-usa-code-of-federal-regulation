##### ยง 146.95 Methods of attribution.
###### Producibility,General.

(a)-(1)A subzone operator must attribute the source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard to feedstocks which were eligible for attribution during the current or prior manufacturing period. Attribution of final products is allowable to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been produced from such feedstocks, using the industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66-16. Once attribution is made for a particular product, that attribution is binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior attributions into account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each attribution.
