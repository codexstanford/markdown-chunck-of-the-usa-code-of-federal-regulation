###### Liquidation.

(c)When a claim has been selected for verification, liquidation will be postponed only on the drawback entry for the claim selected for verification. Postponement will continue in effect until the verification has been completed and a report is issued, subject to the limitation in 19 CFR 159.12(f). In the event that a substantial error is revealed during the verification, CBP may postpone liquidation of all related product line claims, or, in CBP's discretion, all claims made by that claimant.
