###### Identifying parties submitting business proprietary information.

(c)(1) If a party submits a document containing business proprietary information of another person, the submitting party must identify, contiguously with each item of business proprietary information, the person that originally submitted the item (e.g., Petitioner, Respondent A, Respondent B). Business proprietary information not identified will be treated as information of the person making the submission. If the submission contains business proprietary information of only one person, it shall so state on the first page and identify the person that originally submitted the business proprietary information on the first page.

(2) If a party to a proceeding is not represented by an authorized applicant, a party submitting a document containing the unrepresented party's business proprietary information must serve the unrepresented party with a version of the document that contains only the unrepresented party's business proprietary information. The document must not contain the business proprietary information of other parties.
