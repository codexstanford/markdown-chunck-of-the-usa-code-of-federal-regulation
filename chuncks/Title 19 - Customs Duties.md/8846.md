###### Limited successorship for approval of accelerated payment.

(3)When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for accelerated payment of drawback under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of accelerated payment shall remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of accelerated payment of drawback shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section. If such successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's approval of accelerated payment until Customs approves or denies the successor's application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraph (f) of this section).
