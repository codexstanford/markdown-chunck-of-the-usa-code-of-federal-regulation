For an aftermarket part, the applicable product-specific rule of origin set out in section 13 or 14 or Schedule I (PSRO Annex) is the alternative that includes the phrase "for any other good."

The following table sets out the parts and components applicable to Table A.2 and their related tariff provisions, to facilitate implementation of the core parts requirement pursuant to Article 3.7 of the Appendix to the Annex 4-B of the Agreement.
