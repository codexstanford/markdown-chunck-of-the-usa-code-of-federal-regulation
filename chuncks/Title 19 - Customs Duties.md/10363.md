###### Introduction.

(a)A "final determination" in an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation constitutes a final decision by the Secretary as to whether dumping or countervailable subsidization is occurring. If the Secretary's final determination is affirmative, in most instances the Commission will issue a final injury determination (except in certain countervailing duty investigations). Also, if the Secretary's preliminary determination was negative but the final determination is affirmative, the Secretary will impose provisional measures. If the Secretary's final determination is negative, the proceeding, including the injury investigation conducted by the Commission, terminates. This section contains rules regarding deadlines for, and postponement of, final determinations, contents of final determinations, and the effects of final determinations.
