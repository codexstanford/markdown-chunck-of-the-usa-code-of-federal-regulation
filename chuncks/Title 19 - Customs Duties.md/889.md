###### ยง 10.471 Special rule for verifications in Chile of U.S. imports of textile and apparel products.
####### Procedures to determine compliance with applicable customs laws and regulations of the U.S.

(b)For purposes of enabling CBP to determine that an exporter or producer is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, and procedures in cases in which CBP has a reasonable suspicion that a Chilean exporter or producer is engaging in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile and apparel goods, CBP may request that the government of Chile conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. A "reasonable suspicion" for the purpose of this paragraph will be based on relevant factual information, including information of the type set forth in Article 5.5 of the US-CFTA, that indicates circumvention of applicable laws, regulations or procedures regarding trade in textile and apparel goods. CBP may undertake or assist in a verification under this paragraph by conducting visits in Chile, along with the competent authorities of Chile, to the premises of an exporter, producer or any other enterprise involved in the movement of textile or apparel goods from Chile to the United States. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP may take appropriate action, as directed by CITA, which may include suspending the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile and apparel goods exported or produced by the Chilean entity where the reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity relates to those goods. If CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, CBP may take appropriate action with respect to any textile or apparel goods exported or produced by the entity subject to the verification, if directed by CITA.
