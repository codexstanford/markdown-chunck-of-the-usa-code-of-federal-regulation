However, the following merchandise shall not be considered eligible articles entitled to duty-free treatment under the ATPA:

(1) Textiles and apparel articles which were not eligible articles for purposes of the ATPA on January 1, 1994, as the ATPA was in effect on that date, except as otherwise provided in §§ 10.241 through 10.248;
