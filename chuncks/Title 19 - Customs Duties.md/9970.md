####### Admissibility of depositions.

(g)The fact that a deposition is taken and served upon the Commission investigative attorney as provided in this section does not constitute a determination that it is admissible in evidence or that it may be used in the investigation. Only such part of a deposition as is received in evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record in such investigation upon which a determination may be based. Objections may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason that would require exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.
