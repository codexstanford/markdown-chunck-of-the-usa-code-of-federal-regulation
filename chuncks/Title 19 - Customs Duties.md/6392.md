##### ยง 159.6 Difference between liquidated duties and estimated duties.
###### Difference under $20 in original liquidation.

(a)When there is a net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the liquidation of any entry (other than an informal, mail, or baggage entry) and the total amount of estimated duties, fees, and taxes deposited, including any supplemental deposit, the difference will be disregarded and the entry endorsed "as entered."
