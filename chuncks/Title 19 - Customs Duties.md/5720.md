###### Refinery operating records.

(b)An operator may use the actual refinery operating records to attribute the feedstocks used to the removed or consumed products. Customs shall accept the operator's operating conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates that it actually uses these conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever conventions are elected by the operator, they must be used consistently in order to be acceptable to Customs. Additionally, Customs may use these records to test the validity of admissions into the subzone, consumption within and removals from the subzone.
