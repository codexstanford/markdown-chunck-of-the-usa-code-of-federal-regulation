#### Appendix to Part 181 - Rules of Origin Regulations
##### Situation 1:

Use of the listed material in an automotive component

For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of listed materials imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. Because the cast head was produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, its value, under section 10(1)(c), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine.
