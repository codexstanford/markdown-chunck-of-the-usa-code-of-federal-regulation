###### To the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.

(2)If a U.S. exporter or producer receives notification of, and consents to, an origin verification visit by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration under Article 506 of the NAFTA (see ยง 181.74(e) of this part), such consent shall constitute agreement by the U.S. exporter or producer to make available to an officer of that customs administration all records required to be maintained under this section and to provide facilities for the inspection thereof. If, during the course of an origin verification of a U.S. producer, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration finds that the U.S. producer has failed to maintain its records in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the United States, that customs administration will so inform the U.S. producer in writing and will give the U.S. producer 60 calendar days to conform the records to those Principles. If a U.S. exporter or producer fails to maintain records or make records available to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration in accordance with the provisions of this section, or if a U.S. producer fails to conform its records to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as provided in this paragraph, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that is the subject of the verification visit.
