##### Rescission of a designation.

(10)If a producer of a good designates a self-produced material as an intermediate material under subsection (6) and the customs administration of a USMCA country into which the good is imported determines during a verification of origin of the good that the intermediate material is a non-originating material and notifies the producer of this in writing before the written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, the producer may rescind the designation, and the regional value content of the good must be calculated as though the self-produced material were not so designated.
