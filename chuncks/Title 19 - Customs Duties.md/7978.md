The net cost of a part must be calculated in accordance with section 7 (Regional Value Content), without regard to the VNM calculation method chosen.

(5) Except for an advanced battery of subheading 8507.60, a part listed in column 1 of Table A.2, that is for use in a passenger vehicle or light truck, must meet the regional value content requirement of section 13 or Schedule I (PSRO Annex) to be considered originating.

(6) An advanced battery of subheading 8507.60, that is for use in a passenger vehicle or light truck, is originating if it meets the applicable change in tariff classification or regional value content requirements set out in Schedule I (PSRO Annex).

(7) For the purpose of satisfying the requirement specified in subsections (4) through (6), the regional value content of a part listed in column 1 of Table A.2, the value of non-originating materials (VNM) may be determined, at the choice of the vehicle producer or exporter, taking into consideration:

(a) The value of all non-originating materials used in the production of the part; or

(b) the value of non-originating components that are listed in column 2 of Table A.2 that are used in the production of the part.

(8) For the purposes of a regional value content calculation for a good listed in column 1 of Table A.2, based on paragraph (7)(b), any non-originating materials used in the production of the good that are not listed in column 2 of Table A.2 may be disregarded. For greater certainty, any non-originating parts listed in column 2 of Table A.2 must be included in the VNM calculation. Any parts not listed in column 2 of Table A.2 or materials or components used to produce such parts should also not be part of the VNM calculation.

(9) Subsections (7) and (8) do not apply when calculating the regional value content of a part listed in Column 1 of Table A.2 traded on its own. The rules for such parts are listed in section 13 or Schedule I of these Regulations.

(10) For the purpose of satisfying the requirement specified in subsections (4) through (6) and as an alternative to determining the VNM based on the method in subsection (7), the regional value content of the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2 of these Regulations may be determined, at the choice of the vehicle producer or exporter, by treating these parts as a single part, which may be referred to as a super-core part, using the sum of the net cost of each part listed under column 1 of Table A.2 of these Regulations, and when calculating the VNM taking into consideration:

(a) The sum of the value of all non-originating materials used in the production of the parts listed under column 1 of table A.2; or

(b) the sum of the value of the non-originating components that are listed in column 2 of Table A.2 that are used in the production of the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2.

(11) If a non-originating material used in the production of a component listed in column 2 of Table A.2 undergoes further production such that it satisfies the requirements of these Regulations, the component is treated as originating when determining the originating status of the subsequently produced part listed in column 1 of Table A.2, regardless of whether that component was produced by the producer of the part.

(12) The regional value content requirement for the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2 may be averaged in accordance with the provisions in Section 16. Such an average may be calculated using the average regional value content for each individual parts category in the left hand column of Table A.2, or by calculating the average regional value content for all parts in the left hand column of Table A by treating them as a single part, defined as a super-core. Once this average, by either methodology, exceeds the required thresholds listed in subsection (13), all parts used to calculate this average are considered originating.

(13) Further to subsections (2), (7) and (10), the following regional value content thresholds apply to parts for use as original equipment listed under Table A.1 and column 1 of Table A.2:

(a) 66 percent under the net cost method or 76 percent under the transaction value method beginning on July 1, 2020 until June 30, 2021;

(b) 69 percent under the net cost method or 79 percent under the transaction value method beginning on July 1, 2021 until June 30, 2022;

(c) 72 percent under the net cost method or 82 percent under the transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2022 until June 30, 2023; or

(d) 75 percent under the net cost method or 85 percent under the transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2023, and thereafter.

(14) Notwithstanding the regional value content requirements set out in Schedule I (PSRO Annex), a material listed in Table B is considered originating if it satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification requirement or the applicable regional value-content requirement provided in Schedule I (PSRO Annex).

(15) Further to subsection (14), the following regional value content thresholds apply to parts for use as original equipment listed under Table B:

(a) 62.5 percent under the net cost method or 72.5 percent under the transaction value method beginning on July 1, 2020 until June 30, 2021;

(b) 65 percent under the net cost method or 75 percent under the transaction value method beginning on July 1, 2021 until June 30, 2022;

(c) 67.5 percent under the net cost method or 77.5 percent under the transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2022 until June 30, 2023; or

(d) 70 percent under the net cost method or 80 percent under the transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2023, and thereafter.

(16) Notwithstanding the regional value content requirements set out in Schedule I (PSRO Annex), a material listed in Table C is originating if it meets the applicable change in tariff classification requirement or the applicable regional value-content requirement provided in Schedule I (PSRO Annex).

(17) Further to subsection (16), the following regional value content thresholds apply to parts for use as original equipment listed under Table C:

(a) 62 percent under the net cost method or 72 percent under the transaction value method beginning on July 1, 2020 until June 30, 2021;

(b) 63 percent under the net cost method or 73 percent under the transaction value method beginning on July 1, 2021 until June 30, 2022;

(c) 64 percent under the net cost method or 74 percent under the transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2022 until June 30, 2023; or

(d) 65 percent under the net cost method or 75 percent under the transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2023, and thereafter.

(18) For greater certainty, subsections (13), (15) or (17) do not apply to aftermarket parts.

(1) The value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of a heavy truck and parts thereof must not, for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good, include the value of non-originating materials used to produce originating materials that are subsequently used in the production of the good.

(2) Notwithstanding the Product-Specific Rules of Origin in Schedule I (PSRO Annex), the regional value content requirement for a part listed in Table D that is for use in a heavy truck is:

(a) 60 percent under the net cost method or 70 percent under the transaction value method, if the corresponding rule includes a transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2020 until June 30, 2024;

(b) 64 percent under the net cost method or 74 percent under the transaction value method, if the corresponding rule includes a transaction value method beginning on July 1, 2024 until June 30, 2027; or

(c) 70 percent under the net cost method or 80 percent under the transaction value method, if the corresponding rule includes a transaction value method, beginning on July 1, 2027, and thereafter.

(d) July 1 2026 to June 30, 2027 and

(e) July 1, 2027 to the end of the producer's fiscal year.

(6) If a producer chooses to average its regional value content calculations the producer must notify the customs administration of the USMCA country to which passenger vehicles, light trucks, heavy trucks or other vehicles are to be exported, by July 31, 2020 and subsequently at least 10 days before the first day of the producer's fiscal year during which the vehicles will be exported, or such shorter period as the customs administration may accept.

(7) The producer may not modify or rescind the category of passenger vehicles, light trucks, heavy trucks or other vehicles or the period that they have notified the customs authority they intend to use for their averaged regional value calculation.

(8) For purposes of sections 13 through 15, if a producer chooses to average its net cost calculation, the net costs incurred and the values of non-originating materials used by the producer, with respect to

(a) all passenger vehicles, light trucks, or heavy trucks that fall within the category chosen by the producer and that are produced during the fiscal year, or partial fiscal year if the producer's fiscal year begins after July 1, 2020, or

(b) those passenger vehicles, light trucks, or heavy trucks to be exported to the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries that fall within the category chosen by the producer and that are produced during the fiscal year or, or partial fiscal year if the producer's fiscal year begins after July 1, 2020, must be included in the calculation of the regional value content under any of the categories set out in subsection (1).

(9) If the producer of a passenger vehicle, light truck, heavy truck or other vehicle has calculated the regional value content of the motor vehicle on the basis of estimated costs, including standard costs, budgeted forecasts or other similar estimating procedures, before or during the producer's fiscal year, the producer must conduct an analysis at the end of the producer's fiscal year of the actual costs incurred over the period with respect to the production of the motor vehicle, and, if the passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck does not satisfy the regional value content requirement on the basis of the actual costs, immediately inform any person to whom the producer has provided a Certificate of Origin for the motor vehicle, or a written statement that the motor vehicle is an originating good, that the motor vehicle is a non-originating good.

(10) For the purpose of calculating the regional value content for an automotive good listed in Tables A.1, B, C, D, or E, produced in the same plant, a core part listed in Table A.2, or when treating the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2 as a super-core, for use in a passenger vehicle or light truck, the calculation may be averaged:

(a) Over the fiscal year of the motor vehicle producer to whom the good is sold;

(b) over any quarter or month;

(c) over the fiscal year of the producer of the automotive material; or

(d) over any of the categories in paragraph (1)(a) through (d), provided that the good was produced during the fiscal year, quarter, or month forming the basis for the calculation, in which:

(i) The average in paragraph (9)(a) is calculated separately for those goods sold to one or more passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck producer, or

(ii) the average in paragraph (9)(a) or (d) is calculated separately for those goods that are exported to the territory of another USMCA country.

(11) The following example is an "Example" as referred to in subsection 1(4).

(1) In addition to meeting the requirements of sections 13 through 16 or Schedule I (PSRO Annex), a passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck is originating only if, during a time period provided for in subsection (2), at least 70 percent, by value, of the vehicle producer's purchases at the corporate level in the territories of one or more of the USMCA countries of:

(a) Steel listed in Table S; and

(b) aluminum listed in Table S;

are of originating goods.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), only the value of the steel or aluminum listed in Table S that is used in the production of the part will be taken into consideration for a part of subheading 8708.29 or 8708.99 listed in Table S.

(3) The requirement set out in subsection (1) applies to steel and aluminum purchases made by the producer of passenger vehicles, light trucks or heavy trucks, including purchases made directly by the vehicle producer from a steel producer, purchases by the vehicle producer from a steel service center or a steel distributor. Subsection (1) also applies to steel or aluminum covered by a contractual arrangement in which a producer of passenger vehicles, light trucks, or heavy trucks negotiates the terms under which steel or aluminum will be supplied to a parts producer by a steel producer or supplier selected by the vehicle producer, for use in the production of parts that are supplied by the parts producer to a producer of passenger vehicles, light trucks, or heavy trucks. Such purchases must also include steel and aluminum purchases for major stampings that form the "body in white" or chassis frame, regardless of whether the vehicle producer or parts producer makes such purchases.

(4) The requirement set out in subsection (1) applies to steel and aluminum purchased for use in the production of passenger vehicles, light trucks or heavy trucks. Subsection (1) does not apply to steel and aluminum purchased by a producer for other uses, such as the production of other vehicles, tools, dies or molds.

(5) For the purpose subsection (1), as it applies to a steel good set out in Table S, a good is originating if:

(b) beginning on July 1, 2027 the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations, and provided that all steel manufacturing processes occur in one or more of the USMCA countries, except for metallurgical processes involving the refinement of steel additives. Such steel manufacturing processes include the initial melting and mixing and continues through the coating stage. This requirement does not apply to raw materials of used in the steel manufacturing process, including iron ore or reduced, processed, or pelletized iron ore of heading 26.01, pig iron of heading 72.01, raw alloys of heading 72.02 or steel scrap of heading 72.04.

(6) The vehicle producer may calculate the value of steel and aluminum purchases in subsection (1) by the following methods:

(a) For steel or aluminum imported or acquired in the territory of a USMCA country:

(i) The price paid or payable by the producer in the USMCA country where the producer is located;

(ii) the net cost of the material at the time of importation; or

(iii) the transaction value of the material at the time of importation.

(b) For steel or aluminum that is self-produced:

(i) All costs incurred in the production of materials, which includes general expenses, and

(ii) an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that is being valued.

(7) For the purpose of determining the vehicle producer's purchases of steel or aluminum in subsection 17(1), the producer may calculate the purchases:

(a) Over the previous fiscal year of the producer;

(b) over the previous calendar year;

(c) over the quarter or month to date in which the vehicle is exported;

(d) over the producer's fiscal year to date in which the vehicle is exported; or

(e) over the calendar year to date in which the vehicle is exported.

(8) If the producer chooses to base a steel or aluminum calculation on paragraph (7)(c), (d) or (e), that calculation may be based on the producer's estimated purchases for the applicable period.

(9) For the purpose of determining the vehicle producer's purchases of steel or aluminum in subsection (1), the producer may calculate the purchases on the basis of:

(a) All motor vehicles produced in one or more plants in the territory of one or more USMCA countries;

(b) all motor vehicles exported to the territory of one or more USMCA countries;

(c) all motor vehicles in a category set out in subsection 16(1) that are produced in one or more plants in the territory of one or more USMCA countries; or,

(d) all motor vehicles in a category set out in subsection 16(1) exported to the territory of one or more USMCA countries.

(10) The producer may choose different periods for the purpose of its steel and aluminum calculations.

(11) If the producer of a passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck has calculated steel or aluminum purchases on the basis of estimates before or during the applicable period, the producer must conduct an analysis at the end of the producer's fiscal year of the actual purchases made over the period with respect to the production of the vehicle, and, if the passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck does not satisfy the steel or aluminum requirement on the basis of the actual purchases, immediately inform any person to whom the producer has provided a certification of origin for the vehicle, or a written statement that the vehicle is an originating good, that the vehicle is a non-originating good.

(1) In addition to the requirements in sections 13 through 17 and Schedule I (PSRO Annex), a passenger vehicle is originating only if the vehicle producer certifies that the passenger vehicle meets a Labor Value Content (LVC) requirement of:
