###### Substitution drawback.

(2)"Substitution drawback" involves a situation in which a firm uses a quantity of home market inputs equal to, and having the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs as a substitute for them. Substitution drawback does not necessarily result in the conferral of a benefit. However, a benefit exists if the Secretary determines that:

(i) The import and the corresponding export operations both did not occur within a reasonable time period, not to exceed two years; or

(ii) The amount drawn back exceeds the amount of the import charges levied initially on the imported inputs for which drawback is claimed.
