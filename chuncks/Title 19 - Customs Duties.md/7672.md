### PART 182 - UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
#### Subpart D - Post-Importation Duty Refund Claims
##### ยง 182.33 CBP processing procedures.
###### Liquidated entry.

(3)If CBP determines that a claim for a refund filed under ยง 182.32 should be denied and the entry covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation has become final, the claim may be denied without reliquidation of the entry. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest, petition, or request for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, such reliquidation may include denial of the claim filed under this subpart. In either case, CBP will provide notice of the denial and the reason for the denial to the importer in writing or via a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.
