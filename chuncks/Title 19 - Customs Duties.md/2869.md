### PART 24 - CUSTOMS FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE
#### ยง 24.4 Optional method for payment of estimated import taxes on alcoholic beverages upon entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption.
##### Application to defer.

(a)An importer, including a transferee of alcoholic beverages in a Customs bonded warehouse who wishes to pay on a semi-monthly basis the estimated import taxes on alcoholic beverages entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption by him during such a period may apply by letter to the Center director, either at a port of entry or electronically. If the importer desires the additional privilege of depositing estimated tax payments on an extended deferred basis, it must be specifically requested. An importer who receives approval from the Center director to defer such payments may, however, continue to pay the estimated import taxes due at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption.
