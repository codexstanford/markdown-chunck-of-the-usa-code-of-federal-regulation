###### Postponement of visit in Canada or Mexico.

(d)Following receipt of the notification provided for in ยง 181.73 of this part, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the CBP officer who issued the notification of the verification visit, unless a longer period is requested and agreed to by CBP. Such a postponement shall not constitute a failure to provide written consent within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section and shall not otherwise by itself constitute a valid basis upon which CBP may:

(1) Consider a material that is used in the production of a good to be a non-originating material; or

(2) Deny preferential tariff treatment to a good.
