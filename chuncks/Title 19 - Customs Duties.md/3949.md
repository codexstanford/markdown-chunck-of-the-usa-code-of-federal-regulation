(i) The master and house air waybill number (M) (The master air waybill number is the IATA standard 11-digit number; the house air waybill number may be up to 12 alphanumeric characters (each alphanumeric number that is indicated on the paper house air waybill must be included in the electronic transmission; alpha characters may not be eliminated));

(ii) The trip/flight number (M);

(iii) The carrier/ICAO code (M) (The approved electronic data interchange system supports both 3- and 2-character ICAO codes, provided that the final digit of the 2-character code is not a numeric value);

(vi) Scheduled date of arrival (M);

(vii) The total quantity of the cargo covered by the house air waybill based on the smallest external packing unit (M) (For example, 2 pallets containing 50 pieces each would be considered as 100, not 2);
