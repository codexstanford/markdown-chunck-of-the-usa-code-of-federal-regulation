#### ยง 361.101 Aluminum import licensing.
##### Foreign Trade Zone admissions.

(c)All shipments of covered aluminum products into a foreign trade zone (FTZ), known as FTZ admissions, will require an import license prior to the filing of FTZ admission documents, or its electronic equivalents. The license number(s) must be reported on the application for FTZ admission and/or status designation (Customs Form 214) at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of FTZ admission; however, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. FTZ admission documents submitted without the required license number(s) will not be considered complete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of admission. The aluminum license for FTZ admission does not expire, and a further aluminum license will not be required for shipments of entries for consumption from zones into the commerce of the United States.
