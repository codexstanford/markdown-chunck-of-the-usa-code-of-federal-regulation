(c)If, upon examination of the information and inspection of any sample supplied by the port director, the petitioner believes and the port director agrees that the merchandise or the facts surrounding this importation are not sufficient to raise the issue involved in the petition, the port director shall then give the petitioner notice of the first liquidation thereafter which will permit the framing of the issue covered by the petition.
