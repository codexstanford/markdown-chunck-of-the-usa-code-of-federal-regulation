###### Same kind and quality article.

(b)"Same kind and quality article" means an article which is commercially interchangeable with, or which is referred to under the same 8-digit classification of the HTSUS as, the article to which it is compared. (For example, unleaded gasoline and jet fuel (naphtha or kerosene-type), both falling under the same HTSUS classification (2710.00.15) would be considered same kind and quality articles because they fall under the same 8 digit HTSUS classification, even though they are not "commercially interchangeable".)
