###### Exit point.

(d)The exit point referred to in paragraph (b) of this section means an area in close proximity to an actual exit for departing from the Customs territory, including the gate holding area in the case of an airport, but only if there is reasonable assurance that conditionally duty-free merchandise delivered in the gate holding area will be exported from the Customs territory. The exit point in the case of a land border or seaport duty-free store is the point at which a departing individual has no practical alternative to continuing on to a foreign country or to returning to Customs territory by passing through a U.S. Customs inspection facility. The port director's decision as to what constitutes the exit point or reasonable assurance of exportation in a given situation is final.
