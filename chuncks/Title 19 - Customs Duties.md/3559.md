###### Use at port where power of attorney not filed before receipt of computer printout.

(3)If the grantee desires to use the power of attorney at a port covered by the power of attorney, other than the one where the power of attorney was filed, before the first computer printout reflecting this power of attorney is received, the CBP Form 5297, must be filed in triplicate (original and two copies), rather than duplicate. The second copy must be validated by CBP and returned to the grantee. The grantee, at the time of filing a bond at a port other than the port where the power of attorney was filed, must provide this validated copy of the power of attorney as proof of the grant of authority. The validity of this copy of the power of attorney will expire when the first computer printout reflecting this power of attorney is received.
