It must describe the merchandise and show the marks and numbers of the packages, the names of the shippers and consignees, and the destinations. The port director will certify the two copies and return them to the master. Merchandise carried by the vessel in bond under a transportation entry pursuant to part 18 of this chapter is not to be shown on the coastwise Cargo Declaration.

(c) Upon arrival from the foreign port or ports at the subsequent port in the United States, a report of arrival and entry of the vessel shall be made, and tonnage taxes shall be paid. The master shall present Cargo Declaration in accordance with § 4.7 and the certified copies of the coastwise Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302.

(d) All merchandise on the vessel upon its arrival at the subsequent port in the United States is subject to such Customs examination and treatment as may be necessary to protect the revenue.
