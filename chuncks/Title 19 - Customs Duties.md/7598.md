Calculating the regional value content of the component that incorporates the finished block

For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates a sub-component, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the sub-component is determined under section 10(1) (d) or (e) with respect to that sub-component. In this situation, the value, under section 10(1)(b), of the non-originating crankshaft is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. (See examples 1 and 2 for more detailed explanations of sections 10(1) (d) and (e).)

A bumper part, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and is used in the production of a bumper. The bumper is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. Neither a bumper part nor a bumper is a listed material, sub-component, automotive component or automotive component assembly.
