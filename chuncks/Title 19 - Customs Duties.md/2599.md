###### Waiver.

(2)(i) CBP may waive the sealing of a conveyance, compartment, or container in which bonded merchandise is transported if CBP determines that the sealing of the conveyance, compartment, or container is unnecessary to protect the revenue or to prevent violations of the customs laws and regulations.

(ii) Examples of situations where CBP may waive the waiver of the sealing requirement are when the conveyance, compartment, or container cannot be effectively sealed, as in the case of merchandise shipped in open cars or barges or on the decks of vessels, when it is known that any seals would necessarily be removed outside the jurisdiction of the United States for the purpose of discharging or taking on cargo, or when it is known that the breaking of the seals will be necessary to ventilate the hatches.
