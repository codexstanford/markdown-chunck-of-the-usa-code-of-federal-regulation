###### Personal use quantities.

(6)"Personal use quantities" means possession of controlled substances in circumstances where there is no evidence of intent to distribute, or to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting of any controlled substance. A quantity of a controlled substance is presumed to be for personal use if the amounts possessed do not exceed the quantities set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section if there is no evidence of illicit drug trafficking or distribution such as, but not limited to the factors set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. The possession of a narcotic, a depressant, a stimulant, a hallucinogin or a cannabis-controlled substance will be considered in excess of personal use quantities if the dosage unit amount possessed provides the same or greater equivalent efficacy as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
