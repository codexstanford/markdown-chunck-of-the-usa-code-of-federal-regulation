##### ยง 351.211 Antidumping order and countervailing duty order.
###### Introduction.

(a)The Secretary issues an order when both the Secretary and the Commission (except in certain countervailing duty investigations) have made final affirmative determinations. The issuance of an order ends the investigative phase of a proceeding. Generally, upon the issuance of an order, importers no longer may post bonds as security for antidumping or countervailing duties, but instead must make a cash deposit of estimated duties. An order remains in effect until it is revoked. This section contains rules regarding the issuance of orders in general, as well as special rules for orders where the Commission has found a regional industry to exist.
