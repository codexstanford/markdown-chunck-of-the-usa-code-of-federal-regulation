##### Situation:

Use of the automotive component

For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle in which the transmission is used, the value of the transmission is included in the value of the non-originating materials under section 10(1)(c), regardless of whether the producer imported the transmission or acquired it from someone else in the territory of a NAFTA country.

A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and combined with an engine to produce an engine-transmission assembly that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component; the engine-transmission assembly is an automotive component assembly.
