#### Appendix A to Part 190 - General Manufacturing Drawback Rulings
##### see

The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s. 55027(2) and 55207(1) (ยง 190.9).

Piece goods are subject to any one of the following finishing productions:

1. Bleaching,

2. Mercerizing,

3. Dyeing,

4. Printing,

5. A combination of the above, or

6. Any additional finishing processes.

Not applicable.

Rag waste may be incurred. No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer must show the quantity of rag waste, if any, and its value. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the piece goods put into the finishing processes. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records must also be kept.

Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer must show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture or production, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such records for shrinkage, gain and spoilage will also be kept.

Records, which may include records kept in the normal course of business, will be maintained to establish:

1. The identity and 8-digit HTSUS classification of the designated merchandise;

2. The quantity of merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as the designated merchandiseused to produce the exported articles;

3. That, within 5 years after the date of importation of the designated merchandise, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, the manufacturer or producer producedthe exported articles.

To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer must show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading "Procedures and Records Maintained". If those records do not establish satisfaction of all legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.

Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste from each lot of piece goods, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used to produce the exported articles less the amount of piece goods which the value of the waste would replace.

The manufacturer or producer will:

1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;

2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;

3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of liquidation of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;

4. Keep its letter of notification of intent to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix (I. General Instructions, 1 through 10), the corporate name, or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;

5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and

6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 190 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.

Drawback may be allowed under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) upon the exportation of hard or soft refined sugars and sirups manufactured from raw sugar, subject to the following special requirements:

A. The drawback allowance must not exceed an amount calculated pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on a quantity of raw sugar designated by the refiner which contains a quantity of sucrose not in excess of the quantity required to manufacture the exported sugar or sirup, ascertained as provided in this general rule.

B. The refined sugars and sirups must have been manufactured with the use of duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic sugar, or combinations thereof, within 5 years after the date of importation, and must have been exported within 5 years from the date of importation of the designated sugar.

C. All granulated sugar testing by the polariscope 99.5 [degrees] and over will be deemed hard refined sugar. All refined sugar testing by the polariscope less than 99.5 [degrees] will be deemed soft refined sugar. All "blackstrap," "unfiltered sirup," and "final molasses" will be deemed sirup.

D. The imported duty-paid sugar selected by the refiner as the basis for the drawback claim (designated sugar) must be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as that used in the manufacture of the exported refined sugar or sirup and must have been used within 5 years after the date of importation. Duty-paid sugar which has been used at a plant of a refiner within 5 years after the date on which it was imported by such refiner may be designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on refined sugars or sirups manufactured at another plant of the same refiner.

E. For the purpose of distributing the drawback, relative values must be established between hard refined (granulated) sugar, soft refined (various grades) sugar, and sirups at the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract will be deemed the time of separation of the sugars and sirups covered by such abstract.

F. The sucrose allowance per pound on hard refined (granulated) sugar established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, will be applied to hard refined sugar commercially known as loaf, cut loaf, cube, pressed, crushed, or powdered sugar manufactured from the granulated sugar covered by the abstract.

G. The sucrose allowance per gallon on sirup established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, will be applied to sirup further advanced in value by filtration or otherwise, unless such sirup is the subject of a special manufacturing drawback ruling.

H. As to each lot of imported or domestic sugar used in the manufacture of refined sugar or sirup on which drawback is to be claimed, the raw stock records must show the refiner's raw lot number, the number and character of the packages, the settlement weight in pounds, the settlement polarization, and the 8-digit HTSUS classification. Such records covering imported sugar must show, in addition to the foregoing, the import entry number, date of importation, name of importing carrier, country of origin, the Government weight, and the Government polarization.

I. The melt records must show the date of melting, the number of pounds of each lot of raw sugar melted, and the full analysis at melting.

J. There must be kept a daily record of final products boiled showing the date of the melt, the date of boiling, the magma filling serial number, the number of the vacuum pan or crystallizer filling, the date worked off, and the sirup filling serial number.

K. The sirup manufacture records must show the date of boiling, the period of the melt, the sirup filling serial number, the number of barrels in the filling, the magma filling serial number, the quantity of sirup, its disposition in tanks or barrels and the refinery serial manufacture number.

L. The refined sugar stock records must show the refinery serial manufacture number, the period of the melt, the date of manufacture, the grade of sugar produced, its polarization, the number and kind of packages, and the net weight. When soft sugars are manufactured, the commercial grade number and quantity of each must be shown.

M. Each lot of hard or soft refined sugar and each lot of sirup manufactured, regardless of the character of the containers or vessels in which it is packed or stored, must be marked immediately with the date of manufacture and the refinery manufacture number applied to it in the refinery records provided for and shown in the abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, from such records. If all the sugar or sirup contained in any lot manufactured is not intended for exportation, only such of the packages as are intended for exportation need be marked as prescribed above, provided there is filed with the drawback office immediately after such marking a statement showing the date of manufacture, the refinery manufacture number, the number of packages marked, and the quantity of sugar or sirup contained therein. No drawback will be allowed in such case on any sugar or sirup in excess of the quantity shown on the statement as having been marked. If any packages of sugar or sirup so marked are repacked into other containers, the new containers must be marked with the marks which appeared on the original containers and a revised statement covering such repacking and remarking must be filed with the drawback office. If sirups from more than one lot are stored in the same tank, the refinery records must show the refinery manufacture number and the quantity of sirup from each lot contained in such tank.

N. An abstract from the foregoing records covering manufacturing periods of not less than 1 month nor more than 3 months, unless a different period will have been authorized, must be filed when drawback is to be claimed on any part of the refined sugar or sirup manufactured during such period. Such abstract must be filed by each refiner with the drawback office where drawback claims are filed on the basis of this general ruling. Such abstract must consist of: (1) A raw stock record (accounting for Refiner's raw lot No., Import entry No., Packages No. and kind, Pounds, Polarization, By whom imported or withdrawn, Date of importation, Date of receipt by refiner, Date of melt, Importing carrier, Country of origin); (2) A melt record [number of pounds in each lot melted] (accounting for Lot No. Pounds, and Polarization degrees and pounds sucrose); (3) Sirup stock records (accounting for Date of boiling, Refinery serial manufacture No., Quantity of sirup in gallons, and Pounds sucrose contained therein); (4) Refined sugar stock record (accounting for Refinery serial production No., Date of manufacture, Hard or soft refined, Polarization and No., Net weight in pounds); (5) Recapitulation (consisting of (in pounds): (a) Sucrose in process at beginning of period, (b) sucrose melted during period, (c) sucrose in process at end of period, (d) sucrose used in manufacture, and (e) sucrose contained in manufacture, in which item (a) plus item (b), minus item (c), should equal item (d)); and (6) A statement as follows:
