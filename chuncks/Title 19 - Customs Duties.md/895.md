####### Procedures to determine compliance with applicable customs laws and regulations of Chile.

(b)CBP will endeavor to conduct a verification at the request of the government of Chile for purposes of enabling Chile to determine that the U.S. exporter or producer is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, and procedures, if Chile has a reasonable suspicion that a U.S. exporter or producer is engaging in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile and apparel goods. A verification will be conducted under this paragraph regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. A "reasonable suspicion" for the purpose of this paragraph will be based on relevant factual information, including information of the type set forth in Article 5.5 of the US-CFTA, that indicates circumvention of applicable laws, regulations or procedures regarding trade in textile and apparel goods. If the government of Chile is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, it may take action as permitted under its laws with respect to any textile or apparel goods exported or produced by the entity subject to the verification.
