(B)If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may, at the timely request of an interested party or at the Secretary's discretion, direct the Customs Service to begin the suspension of liquidation and apply the applicable cash deposit rate under paragraph (l)(3)(iii)(A) of this section at an alternative date until appropriate liquidation instructions are issued. In response to a timely request from an interested party, the Secretary will only consider an alternative date based on a specific argument supported by evidence establishing the appropriateness of that alternative date.

(4) If the Secretary issues a final scope ruling under paragraph (h) of this section that the product is not covered by the scope of the order, and entries of the product at issue are not otherwise subject to suspension of liquidation as a result of another segment of the proceeding, such as a circumvention inquiry under ยง 351.226 or a covered merchandise inquiry under ยง 351.227, the Secretary will order the Customs Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation and refund any cash deposits for such entries.

(5) Nothing in this section affects the Customs Service's authority to take any additional action with respect to the suspension of liquidation or related measures.
