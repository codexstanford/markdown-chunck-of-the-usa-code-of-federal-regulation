(a)A claim for drawback will be granted, upon the submission of appropriate documentation to substantiate compliance with the drawback laws and regulations of the United States, evidence of exportation to Canada or Mexico, and satisfactory evidence of the payment of duties to Canada or Mexico. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, the documentation, filing procedures, time and place requirements and other applicable procedures required to determine whether a good qualifies for drawback must be in accordance with the provisions of part 190 of this chapter, as appropriate; however, a drawback claim subject to the provisions of this subpart must be filed separately from any part 190 drawback claim (that is, a claim that involves goods exported to countries other than Canada or Mexico). Claims inappropriately filed or otherwise not completed within the periods specified in ยง 182.46 will be considered abandoned.
