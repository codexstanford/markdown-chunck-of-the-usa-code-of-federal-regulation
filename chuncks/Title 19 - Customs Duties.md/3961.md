##### ยง 122.48b Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS).
###### Conditional data element: Master air waybill number.

(2)The master air waybill (MAWB) number for each leg of the flight is a conditional data element. The MAWB number is a required data element in the following circumstances; otherwise, the submission of the MAWB number is optional, but encouraged:

(i) When the ACAS filer is a different party than the party that will file the advance electronic air cargo data required by ยง 122.48a. To allow for earlier submission of the ACAS filing, the initial ACAS filing may be submitted without the MAWB number, as long as the MAWB number is later submitted by the ACAS filer or the inbound air carrier according to the applicable ACAS time frame for data submission in paragraph (b) of this section; or

(ii) When the ACAS filer is transmitting all the data elements required by ยง 122.48a according to the applicable ACAS time frame for data submission; or

(iii) When the inbound air carrier would like to receive from CBP a check on the ACAS status of a specific shipment. If the MAWB number is submitted, either by the ACAS filer or the inbound air carrier, CBP will provide this information to the inbound air carrier upon request.
