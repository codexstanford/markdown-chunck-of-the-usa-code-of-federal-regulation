##### Situation 2:

The non-listed material is a non-originating material

The bumper is a non-originating material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(f) with respect to the bumper. In this situation, the value of the bumper is included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle. Because a bumper is not a listed material, the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle does not have the option, under section 10(1)(b)(ii), to include only the value of the imported bumper part in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
