If CBP timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to examine the merchandise (paragraph (f) of this section), but the merchandise is exported or destroyed without having been presented to CBP for such examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback, must be denied. If CBP notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by CBP to examine or to waive examination is absent, the merchandise may be exported or destroyed without delay and will be deemed to have been returned to CBP custody.
