### PART 123 - CBP RELATIONS WITH CANADA AND MEXICO
#### Subpart J - Advance Information for Cargo Arriving by Rail or Truck
##### ยง 123.91 Electronic information for rail cargo required in advance of arrival.
###### Cargo information required.

(d)The rail carrier must electronically transmit to CBP the following information for all required incoming cargo that will arrive in the United States by train:

(1) The rail carrier identification SCAC code (the unique Standard Carrier Alpha Code assigned for each carrier by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association; see ยง 4.7a(c)(2)(iii) of this chapter);

(2) The carrier-assigned conveyance name, equipment number and trip number;

(3) The scheduled date and time of arrival of the train at the first port of entry in the United States;

(4) The numbers and quantities of the cargo laden aboard the train as contained in the carrier's bill of lading, either master or house, as applicable (this means the quantity of the lowest external packaging unit; containers and pallets do not constitute acceptable information; for example, a container holding 10 pallets with 200 cartons should be described as 200 cartons);

(5) A precise cargo description (or the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number(s) to the 6-digit level under which the cargo is classified if that information is received from the shipper) and weight of the cargo; or, for a sealed container, the shipper's declared description and weight of the cargo (generic descriptions, specifically those such as "FAK" ("freight of all kinds"), "general cargo," and "STC" ("said to contain") are not acceptable);

(6) The shipper's complete name and address, or identification number, from the bill(s) of lading (for each house bill in a consolidated shipment, the identity of the foreign vendor, supplier, manufacturer, or other similar party is acceptable (and the address of the foreign vendor, etc., must be a foreign address); by contrast, the identity of the carrier, freight forwarder, consolidator, or broker, is not acceptable; the identification number will be a unique number to be assigned by CBP upon the implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment);

(7) The complete name and address of the consignee, or identification number, from the bill(s) of lading (The consignee is the party to whom the cargo will be delivered in the United States. However, in the case of cargo shipped "to order of [a named party]," the carrier must identify this named "to order" party as the consignee; and, if there is any other commercial party listed in the bill of lading for delivery or contact purposes, the carrier must also report this other commercial party's identity and contact information (address) in the "Notify Party" field of the advance electronic data transmission to CBP, to the extent that the CBP-approved electronic data interchange system is capable of receiving this data. The identification number will be a unique number assigned by CBP upon implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment);

(8) The place where the rail carrier takes possession of the cargo shipment;

(9) Internationally recognized hazardous material code when such materials are being shipped by rail;

(10) Container numbers (for containerized shipments) or the rail car numbers; and

(11) The seal numbers for all seals affixed to containers and/or rail cars to the extent that CBP's data system can accept this information (for example, if a container has more than two seals, and only two seal numbers can be accepted through the system per container, the carrier's electronic presentation of two of these seal numbers for the container would be considered as constituting full compliance with this data element).
