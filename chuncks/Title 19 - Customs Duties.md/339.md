##### Prototypes
###### ยง 10.91 Prototypes used exclusively for product development and testing.
####### Relevant value for used prototype or parts sold.

(2)For purposes of this section, with respect to any duty owed on prototypes or parts of prototypes that are sold as scrap, or waste, or for recycling, where the duty owed is based upon value, the relevant value is the market value of the prototypes or parts, based upon their character and condition following use for the purposes prescribed in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01. The relevant value should take into consideration any damage, degradation or deterioration to the prototypes or parts resulting from their use as a prototype and/or otherwise resulting to the articles from any other cause prior to their sale as scrap, waste, or for recycling. The market value will generally be measured by the selling price. Should a prototype or part of a prototype become a component of another product that is sold as scrap, waste, or recycled material, the relevant market value would be that portion of the selling price attributable to the component (prototype or part) as provided in this paragraph.
