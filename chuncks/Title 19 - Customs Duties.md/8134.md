(b)The value of the exported merchandise or articles eligible for drawback is the selling price as declared for the Electronic Export Information (EEI), including any adjustments and exclusions required by 15 CFR 30.6(a). If there is no selling price for the EEI, then the value is the other value as declared for the EEI including any adjustments and exclusions required by 15 CFR 30.6(a) (e.g., the market price, if the goods are shipped on consignment). (For special types of transactions where certain unusual conditions are involved, the value for the EEI is determined pursuant to 15 CFR part 30 subpart C.) If no EEI is required (15 CFR part 30 subpart D for a complete list of exemptions), then the claimant must provide the value that would have been set forth on the EEI when the exportation took place, but for the exemption from the requirement for an EEI.
