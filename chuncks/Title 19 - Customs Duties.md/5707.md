###### Privileged status after admission.

(e)Nonprivileged status feedstock is eligible for privileged status only if the request shows to the satisfaction of the Customs Service that there was no manipulation or manufacture of the feedstock to change its tariff classification before the request is granted. The absence of such manipulation or manufacture can be shown by demonstrating that the feedstock was placed in an empty tank, in a tank that contained only feedstock with the same nominal specifications or providing a sample which shows there was no change in tariff status. The existence of negligible amounts of other feedstocks may be disregarded only in accordance with ยง 146.95(b). A request for after-admission privileged foreign status shall be denied unless the feedstock's tank records from admission to the time that the request is made accompany the request. A refiner who makes such a request shall not put any other feedstock having different nominal specifications into the tank until the request for privileged status is granted. The Customs Service will deny or revoke a post-admission request if a refiner fails to retain the integrity of the feedstock in the tank.
