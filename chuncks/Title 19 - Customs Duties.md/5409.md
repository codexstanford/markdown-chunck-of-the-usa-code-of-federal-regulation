###### Dutiable shipments not over $2,500 for Government agencies.

(c)When a dutiable shipment not exceeding $2,500 in value is addressed to a U.S. Government department or agency, the port director may release the merchandise prior to the payment of duties under an entry on CBP Form 368 or 368A (serially numbered) or CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent upon the receipt of a stipulation in the form set forth in ยง 141.102(d) of this chapter. If the stipulation does not accompany the shipment, the port director will notify the Government department or agency of the arrival of the shipment and request the stipulation. Upon receipt of the completed stipulation and preparation of the entry form, the port director will stamp all mail articles in the shipment to show that they have received customs treatment and will return the shipment to the Postal Service for delivery, unless the addressee has arranged to pick up the shipment at the CBP office where it is being processed. The proper Government department or agency will be billed later for any duties and taxes due.
