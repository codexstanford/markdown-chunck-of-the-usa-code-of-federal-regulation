####### Statement.

(c)For purposes of this subpart, each corrected declaration or notification of an incorrect certification must be accompanied by a statement, submitted in writing or via an authorized electronic data interchange system, which:

(1) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect declaration or certification relates;

(2) In the case of a corrected declaration, identifies each affected import transaction, including each port of importation and the approximate date of each importation, and in the case of a notification of an incorrect certification, identifies each affected exportation transaction, including each port of exportation and the approximate date of each exportation. A U.S. producer who provides written notification that certain information in a certification of origin is incorrect and who is unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph must provide as much information concerning those transactions as the producer, by the exercise of good faith and due diligence, is able to obtain;

(3) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the declaration or certification; and

(4) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the declaration or certification, and states that the person will provide any additional pertinent information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected declaration or certification within 30 calendar days or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.
