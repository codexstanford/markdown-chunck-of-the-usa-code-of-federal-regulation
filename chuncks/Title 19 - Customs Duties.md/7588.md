##### Situation 3:

Use of a non-originating automotive component incorporating the listed material

The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the cast head), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The producer of the heavy-duty vehicle may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials either

The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the cast head, as determined under section 10(1)(c), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.

A rocker arm assembly, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. No other non-originating materials are used in the production of the engine. The rocker arm assembly is neither a listed material nor a sub-component; the engine is an automotive component.
