(d)The port director may require an operator to furnish, on 10 days notice, a new Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond on Customs Form 301. If the operator fails to furnish the new bond, no more merchandise will be received in the zone in zone status. Merchandise in zone status (other than domestic status) will be removed at the risk and expense of the operator. A new bond may be required if (1) the activated zone area is substantially altered; (2) the character of merchandise admitted to the zone or operations performed in the zone are substantially changed; (3) the existing bond lacks good and sufficient surety; or (4) for any other reason that substantially affects the liability of the operator under the bond. Although a new bond may not be required, the operator shall obtain the consent of the surety to any material alteration in the boundaries of the zone.
