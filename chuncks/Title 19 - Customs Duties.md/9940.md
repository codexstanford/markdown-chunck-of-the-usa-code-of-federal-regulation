(c)An investigation before the Commission may be terminated pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of a consent order. Termination by consent order need not constitute a determination as to violation of section 337. A motion for termination by consent order shall contain copies of any licensing or other settlement agreement, any supplemental agreements, and a statement that there are no other agreements, written or oral, express or implied between the parties concerning the subject matter of the investigation. If the licensing or other settlement agreement contains confidential business information within the meaning of ยง 201.6(a) of this chapter, a copy of the agreement with such information deleted shall accompany the motion. On motion for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may limit service of the agreements to the settling parties and the Commission investigative attorney. If there are no additional agreements, the moving parties shall certify that there are no additional agreements.
