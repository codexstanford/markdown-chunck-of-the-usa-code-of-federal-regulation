##### ยง 19.36 Requirements for duty-free store operations.
###### Reimported merchandise.

(d)Merchandise purchased in a duty-free store is not eligible for exemption from duty, or tax where applicable, under chapter 98, subchapter IV, Harmonized Tariff Schedule, if it is brought back to the United States after exportation. To enforce this restriction, the port director may require the proprietor to mark or otherwise place a distinguishing identifier on individual items of merchandise to indicate the items were sold in a U.S. duty-free store, if a pattern is disclosed in which such items are being brought back to the United States without declaration. A pattern of undeclared reimportations means a number of instances over a period of time and not isolated instances of unrelated violations. Any such marking required by the port director will be inconspicuous to the purchaser and will not detract from the value of the merchandise. The marking requirement will be limited to the items or types of merchandise noted in the pattern, and will not be extended to all merchandise of the responsible store proprietor unless all or most items are part of the pattern.
