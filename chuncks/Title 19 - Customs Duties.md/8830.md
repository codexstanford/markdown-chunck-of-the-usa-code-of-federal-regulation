###### Limited successorship for waiver of prior notice.

(3)When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for waiver of prior notice under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of waiver of prior notice shall remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of waiver of prior notice shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section. If such successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's waiver of prior notice until Customs approves or denies the successor's application for waiver of prior notice under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).
