##### see

The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (ยง 190.9).

The imported merchandise or drawback products will be used to manufacture or produce articles in accordance with ยง 190.2.

Drawback will not be allowed under this general manufacturing drawback ruling when the process performed results only in the restoration of the merchandise to its condition at the time of importation.

Not applicable.

Records will be maintained showing the extent of any loss or gain in net weight or measurement of the imported merchandise, caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.

No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, records will be maintained to establish the value, quantity, and disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records will be maintained to establish that fact.

Records, which may include records kept in the normal course of business, will be maintained to establish:

1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of the imported merchandise; and

2. The quantity of imported merchandiseused in producing the exported articles.

To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer must show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading "Procedures and Records Maintained". If those records do not establish satisfaction of all legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.

The records of the manufacturer or producer must show, as to each lot of fur skins and/or fur skin articles used in the manufacture or production of articles for exportation with benefit of drawback, the lot number and date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production, the quantity, identity, description, and 8-digit HTSUS classification of the imported merchandise used, the condition in which imported, the process or processes applied thereto, the quantity, description, and 8-digit HTSUS classification of the finished articles obtained, and the quantity of imported pieces rejected, if any, or spoiled in manufacture or production.

Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible merchandise that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible material used to produce the exported articles, less the amount of that merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. (If rejects and/or spoilage are incurred, the quantity of imported merchandise used will be determined by deducting from the quantity of fur skins or fur skin articles put into manufacture or production the quantity of such rejects and/or spoilage.)

1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;

2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;
