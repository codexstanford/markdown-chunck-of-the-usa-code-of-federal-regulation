###### Country of origin determinations.

(j)In considering whether a product is covered by the scope of the order at issue, the Secretary may need to determine the country of origin of the product. To make such a determination, the Secretary may use any reasonable method and is not bound by the determinations of any other agency, including tariff classification and country of origin marking rulings issued by the Customs Service.

(1) In determining the country of origin, the Secretary may conduct a substantial transformation analysis that considers relevant factors that arise on a case-by-case basis, including:

(i) Whether the processed downstream product is a different class or kind of merchandise than the upstream product;

(ii) The physical characteristics (including chemical, dimensional, and technical characteristics) of the product;

(iii) The intended end-use of the downstream product;

(iv) The cost of production/value added of further processing in the third country or countries;

(v) The nature and sophistication of processing in the third country or countries; and

(vi) The level of investment in the third country or countries.

(2) In conducting a country of origin determination, the Secretary also may consider where the essential component of the product is produced or where the essential characteristics of the product are imparted.
