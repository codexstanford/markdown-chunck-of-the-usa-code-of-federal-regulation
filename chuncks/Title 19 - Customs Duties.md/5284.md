###### Remote Location Filing (RLF)

(a)-"RLF" is an elective method of making entry by which a customs broker with a national permit electronically transmits all data information associated with an entry that CBP can process in a completely electronic data interchange system to a RLF-operational CBP location from a remote location other than where the goods are being entered. (Importers filing on their own behalf may file electronically in any port, subject to ABI filing requirements.)
