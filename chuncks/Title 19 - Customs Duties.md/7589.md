##### Situation 1:

Use of the material in an automotive component

For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of non-originating materials that are not listed materials is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. Because the rocker arm assembly was produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it is a non-originating material and its value, under section 10(1)(f), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine.
