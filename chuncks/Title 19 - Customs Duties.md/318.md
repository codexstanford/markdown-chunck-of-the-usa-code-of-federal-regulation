###### ยง 10.81 Use in any port.

(a) Salt withdrawn under bond for use in curing fish on the shores of navigable waters may be used for such purpose at any port, but the evidence of use in such cases shall be submitted through the director of the port where the salt was used.

(b) If desired, salt to be used in curing fish on shore at another port than that in which it is warehoused in bond may be withdrawn under a transportation entry and shipped in bond to the other port at which it is to be used, where it may be entered on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, which shall show withdrawal of the salt for use in curing fish. Thereupon, and upon the filing of a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in ยง 113.62 of this chapter, such salt may be used without being sent to a bonded warehouse or public store. In such a case the proof of use shall be filed at the latter port.
