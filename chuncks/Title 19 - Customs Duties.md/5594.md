###### Supervision of merchandise.

(d)The port director may authorize the receipt of zone status merchandise at a zone without physical supervision by a Customs officer (see ยง 146.3). In that case, the operator shall supervise the receipt of merchandise into the zone, report the receipt and condition of the merchandise, and mark packages with the unique Customs Form 214 number so that the merchandise can be traced to a particular Customs Form 214. Packages that are accounted for under a Customs-authorized inventory method other than specific identification, need not be marked with a unique Customs Form 214 number but must be adequately identified so Customs can conduct an inventory count. The operator shall submit the Custom Form 214 to Customs at the location specified by the port director.
