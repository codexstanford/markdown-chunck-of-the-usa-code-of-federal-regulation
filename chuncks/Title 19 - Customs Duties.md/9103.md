###### Statements under penalty of perjury.

(2)A former Commission employee may make any statements required to be made under penalty of perjury, such as those required in registration statements for securities, tax returns, or security clearances. The exception does not, however, permit a former employee to submit pleadings, applications, or other documents in a representational capacity on behalf of another merely because the attorney or other representative must sign the documents under oath or penalty of perjury.
