## Chapter I - U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security; Department of the Treasury
### PART 111 - CUSTOMS BROKERS
#### Subpart D - Cancellation, Suspension, or Revocation of License or Permit, and Monetary Penalty in Lieu of Suspension or Revocation
##### ยง 111.58 Content of statement of charges.

Any statement of charges referred to in this subpart must give a plain and concise, but not necessarily detailed, description of the facts claimed to constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of the license or permit. The statement of charges also must specify the sanction being proposed (that is, suspension of the license or permit or revocation of the license or permit), but if a suspension is proposed the charges need not state a specific period of time for which suspension is proposed. A statement of charges which fairly informs the broker of the charges against him so that he is able to prepare his response will be deemed sufficient. Different means by which a purpose might have been accomplished, or different intents with which acts might have been done, so as to constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of the license may be alleged in the alternative under a single count in the statement of charges.
