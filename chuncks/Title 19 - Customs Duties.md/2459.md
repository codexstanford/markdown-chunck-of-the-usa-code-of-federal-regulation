(b)When a shipment of pesticides or devices arrives and entry is attempted in the United States without a completed Notice of Arrival having been filed with CBP pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the shipment will be detained by CBP at the importer's risk and expense until the completed Notice of Arrival is presented to CBP or until other disposition is ordered by the Administrator. Such detention is not to exceed a period of 30-calendar days, or such additional extended 30-calendar day detention period as CBP may for good cause authorize.
