(b)(1) Unless the requirement for filing is waived by the port director as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, each vehicle or equipment item offered for introduction into the Customs territory of the United States shall be denied entry unless the importer or consignee files with the entry a declaration, in duplicate, which declares or affirms one of the following:

(i) The vehicle or equipment item was manufactured on a date when no applicable safety standards were in effect.

(ii) The vehicle or equipment item conforms to all applicable safety standards (or, the vehicle does not conform solely because readily attachable equipment items which will be attached to the vehicle before it is offered for sale to the first purchaser for purposes other than resale are not attached) and bears a certification label or tag to that effect permanently affixed by the original manufacturer to the vehicle or to the equipment item, or to the outside of the container in which the equipment item is delivered, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation (49 CFR parts 555, 567, 568 and 571) under section 114 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1403).

(iii) The vehicle or equipment item was not manufactured in conformity to all applicable safety standards, but it has been or will be brought into conformity. Within 120 days after entry, or within a period not to exceed 180 days after entry, if additional time is granted by the Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("Administrator, NHTSA"), the importer or consignee will submit a true and complete statement to the Administrator, NHTSA, identifying the manufacturer, contractor, or other person who has brought the vehicle or equipment item into conformity, describing the exact nature and extent of the work performed, and certifying that the vehicle or equipment item has been brought into conformity, and that the vehicle or equipment item will not be sold or offered for sale until the Administrator, NHTSA, issues an approval letter to the port director stating that the vehicle or equipment item described in the declaration has been brought into conformity with all applicable safety standards.

(iv) The vehicle or equipment item is intended solely for export, and the vehicle or equipment item, and the outside of the container of the equipment item, if any, bears a label or tag to that effect.

(v) The importer or consignee is a nonresident of the United States, is importing the vehicle or equipment item primarily for personal use for a period not exceeding 1 year from the date of entry, will not sell it in the United States during that period, and has stated his passport number and country of issue, if he has a passport, on the declaration.

(vi) The importer or consignee is a member of the armed forces of a foreign country on assignment in the U.S. or is a member of the personnel of a foreign government on assignment in the U.S. or other individual who is within the class of persons for whom free entry of vehicles has been authorized by the Department of State in accordance with general principles of international law, is importing the vehicle or equipment item for purposes other than resale; and a copy of his official orders, if any, is attached to the declaration (or, if a qualifying member of the personnel of a foreign government on assignment in the U.S., the name of the Embassy to which he is accredited is stated on the declaration).

(vii) The vehicle or equipment item is imported solely for the purpose of show, test, experiment, competition (a vehicle the configuration of which at the time of entry is such that it cannot be licensed for use on the public roads is considered to be imported for the purpose of competition), repair or alteration, and the statement required by 19 CFR 12.80(c)(2) or (c)(3) is attached to the declaration.

(viii) The vehicle was not manufactured primarily for use on the public roads and is not a "motor vehicle" as defined in section 102 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1391).

(2) A vehicle imported solely for the purpose of test or experiment which is the subject of a declaration filed under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section may be licensed for use on the public roads for a period not to exceed 1 year from the date of importation if use on the public roads is an integral part of the test or experiment. The vehicle may be licensed for use on the public roads for one or more further periods which, when added to the initial 1 year period, shall not exceed a total of 3 years, upon application to and approval by the Administrator, NHTSA.
