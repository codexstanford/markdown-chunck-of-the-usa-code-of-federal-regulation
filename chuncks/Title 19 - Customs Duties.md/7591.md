##### Situation 3:

Use of a non-originating automotive component incorporating the material

The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The producer of the heavy-duty vehicle may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials either

The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the rocker arm assembly, as determined under section 10(1)(f), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
