(a)Any article in the baggage of a passenger arriving from a foreign country which is not declared as required by this subpart shall be seized if it is available for seizure at the time the violation is detected, and the personal penalty prescribed by section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1497), shall be demanded from the passenger. If the article is not seized, a claim for the personal penalty shall be made against the person who imported the article without declaration.
