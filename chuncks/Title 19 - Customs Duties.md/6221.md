If the importer is dissatisfied with the port director's or Center director's determination made before January 19, 2017, or the Center director's determination made on or after January 19, 2017, he may file with the Center director, within 14 calendar days after the mailing of the notice, a written request in duplicate for a redetermination of the staple length. Each such request shall include a statement of the claimed staple length for the cotton in question and a clear statement of the basis for the claim.

All expenses occasioned by any redetermination of staple length, exclusive of the compensation of CBP officers, shall be reimbursed to the Government by the importer.
