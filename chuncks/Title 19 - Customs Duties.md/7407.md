(c)For purposes of this subpart, evidence of exportation and satisfactory evidence of payment of duties in Canada or Mexico must consist of one of the following types of documentation, provided that, for purposes of evidence of duties paid, such documentation includes the import entry number, the date of importation, the tariff classification number, the rate of duty and the amount of duties paid:

(1) In the case of Canada, the Canadian entry document, referred to as the Canada Customs Invoice or B-3, presented with either the K-84 Statement or the Detailed Coding Statement.

(2) In the case of Mexico, the Mexican entry document (the "pedimento");

(3) The final customs duty determination of Canada or Mexico, or a copy thereof, respecting the relevant entry; or

(4) An affidavit, from the person claiming drawback, which is based on information received from the importer of the good in Canada or Mexico.
