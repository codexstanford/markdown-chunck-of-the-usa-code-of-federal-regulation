### PART 181 - NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
#### Subpart I - Advance Ruling Procedures
##### ยง 181.93 Submission of advance ruling requests.
###### Requests for immediate consideration.

(d)CBP will normally process requests for advance rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible, as specified in ยง 181.99 of this part. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram or electronic transmission will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but advance rulings will not be issued by telegram or electronic transmission. A telegram or electronic transmission must be followed up with a signed original within 14 calendar days of the submission of the telegram or electronic transmission. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for an advance ruling will be acted upon by the time requested.
