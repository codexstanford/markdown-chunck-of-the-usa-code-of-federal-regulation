###### Initiation of administrative disciplinary hearing.

(a)(1) On receipt of information regarding a possible violation of 18 U.S.C. 207, and after determining that such information does not appear to be frivolous, the Chairman shall expeditiously provide such information, along with any comments or agency regulations, to the Director and to the Criminal Division, Department of Justice. Any investigation or administrative action will be coordinated with the Department of Justice to avoid prejudicing criminal proceedings, unless the Department of Justice informs the Commission that it does not intend to initiate criminal prosecution.

(2) Whenever the Chairman has determined after appropriate review that there is reasonable cause to believe that a former Commission employee has violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b), or (c) or implementing regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (5 CFR part 737), he or she shall initiate an administrative disciplinary proceeding by providing the former Commission employee with notice as defined in paragraph (b).

(3) The Chairman shall take all necessary steps to protect the privacy of former employees prior to a determination of sufficient cause to initiate an administrative disciplinary hearing.
