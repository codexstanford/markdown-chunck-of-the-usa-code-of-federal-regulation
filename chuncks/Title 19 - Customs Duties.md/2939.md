#### § 24.17 Reimbursable services of CBP employees.

(a) Amounts of compensation and expenses chargeable to parties-in-interest in connection with services rendered by CBP employees during regular hours of duty or on Customs overtime assignments (19 U.S.C. 267, 1451), under one or more of the following circumstances shall be collected from such parties-in-interest and deposited by port directors as repayments to the appropriation from which paid.

(1) When a CBP employee is assigned on board a vessel or vehicle under authority of section 457, Tariff Act of 1930, to protect the revenue, the owner or master of such vessel or vehicle shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto.

(2) When a CBP employee is assigned on board a vessel under authority of section 458, Tariff Act of 1930, to supervise the unlading of such vessel, the master or owner of such vessel shall be charged the full compensation of such employee for every day consumed in unlading after the expiration of 25 days after the date of the vessel's entry.

(3) When a CBP employee is assigned under authority of section 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to supervise the exportation, destruction, or marking to exempt articles from the duty provided for in such section, the importer of such merchandise shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto.

(4) When a CBP employee is assigned pursuant to § 101.4 of this chapter to a Customs station or other place which is not a port of entry for service in connection with the entry or clearance of a vessel, the owner, master, or agent of the vessel shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns. When a CBP employee is so assigned to render service in connection with the entry or delivery of merchandise only, the private interest shall be charged only for the authorized travel and subsistence expenses incurred by such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto except that no collection need be made if the total amount chargeable against one importer for one day amounts to less than 50 cents (see § 101.4(b) of this chapter). Where the amount chargeable is 50 cents or more, but less than $1, a minimum charge of $1 shall be made.

(5) When a CBP employee is assigned under authority of section 447, Tariff Act of 1930, to make entry of a vessel at a place other than a port of entry or to supervise the unlading of cargo, the private interest shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto.

(6) [Reserved]

(7) When a CBP employee is assigned on any vessel or vehicle, under authority of section 456, Tariff Act of 1930, while proceeding from one port to another, the master or owner of such vessel or vehicle shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto, or, in lieu of such expenses, the master or owner may furnish such employee the accommodations usually supplied to passengers.

(8) When a CBP employee is assigned under authority of section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to supervise the manipulation of merchandise at a place other than a bonded warehouse, the compensation and expenses of such employee shall be reimbursed to the Government by the party in interest. A Customs officer so assigned is not acting as a customs warehouse officer, since the services have no connection with a customs bonded warehouse.

(9) When a CBP employee is assigned to supervise the destruction of merchandise pursuant to section 557(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, at a place where a CBP employee is not regularly assigned, the full compensation and expenses of such employee shall be reimbursed to the Government by the party in interest.

(10) When a CBP employee is assigned to supervise the labeling of imported merchandise in accordance with the provisions of §§ 11.12(b), 11.12a(b), 11.12b(b) of the regulations of this chapter or the removal or obliteration of prohibited markings and trade marks from merchandise which has been detained or seized in accordance with the provisions of §§ 11.13(c) and 11.17(b) of the regulations of this chapter or to supervise the exportation or destruction of any such merchandise, the compensation and expenses of such CBP employee shall be reimbursed to the Government by the party in interest.

(11) When a CBP employee is assigned to supervise examination, sampling, weighing, repacking, segregation, or other operation on merchandise in accordance with §§ 151.4, 151.5, 158.11, 158.14, and 158.42 of this chapter, the compensation and other expenses of such employee shall be reimbursed to the Government by the party-in-interest except when a warehouse proprietor is liable therefor.

(12) When a CBP employee is assigned to provide Customs services at an airport or other facility under 19 U.S.C. 58b, the facility shall reimburse to the Government an amount equal to the salary and expenses of such employee (including overtime) plus any other expenses incurred in providing those Customs services at the facility.

(b) When a CBP employee is assigned to render services the nature of which is such that the private interest is required to reimburse the Government for his compensation and on the same assignment performs services for which compensation is not reimbursable, a charge shall be made to the private interest for the full compensation of the CBP employee unless the time devoted to each class of service can be clearly segregated.

(c) The charge for any service enumerated in this section for which expenses are required to be reimbursed shall include actual transportation expenses of a CBP employee within the port limits and any authorized travel expenses of a CBP employee, including per diem, when the services are performed outside the port limits irrespective of whether the services are performed during a regular tour of duty or during a Customs overtime assignment. No charge shall be made for transportation expenses when a CBP employee is reporting to as a first daily assignment, or leaving from as a last daily assignment, a place within or outside the port limits where he is assigned to a regular tour of duty. No charge shall be made for transportation expenses within the port limits or travel expenses, including per diem, outside the port limits in connection with a Customs overtime assignment for which reimbursement of expenses is not covered by this section.
