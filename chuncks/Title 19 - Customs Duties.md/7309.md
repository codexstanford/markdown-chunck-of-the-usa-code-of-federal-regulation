###### Advisory ruling.

(b)An advisory ruling is a non-binding, non-reviewable written statement issued by the Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border protection, which does no more than call attention to a well established interpretation or principal of law relating to the country of origin, without applying it to a particular set of facts. CBP will issue an advisory ruling in response to a request for a final determination if:

(1) The request suggests that general information, rather than a final determination, is actually being sought,

(2) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in ยง 177.25(a), or

(3) The ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and CBP believes that the general information supplied by an advisory ruling may be of some benefit to the party making the request. An advisory ruling is not a ruling issued prior to importation under 28 U.S.C. 1581(h).
