###### Procedures when pipeline is only carrier.

(c)When a pipeline is the only carrier of the in-bond merchandise and there is no transfer to another carrier, the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt issued by the pipeline operator to the shipper must be submitted with the in-bond application. If there are no discrepancies between the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt and the in-bond application for the merchandise, and provided that CBP has no reasonable cause to suspect fraud, the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt will be accepted by CBP as establishing the quantity and identity of the merchandise transported. The pipeline operator is responsible for any discrepancies, including shortages, irregular deliveries, or nondeliveries at the port of destination or exportation (see ยง 18.8).
