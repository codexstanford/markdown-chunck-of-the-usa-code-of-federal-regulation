(3)If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be denied and the entry covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation has become final, the claim may be denied without reliquidation of the entry. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest or petition for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, such reliquidation may include denial of the claim filed under this subpart. In either case, the Center director shall give written notice of the denial and the reason therefor to the importer and, in the case of a denial on the merits, to any person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin relating to the good. Each notice of denial given to a person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin shall also include a statement regarding the right to file a protest against the denial under part 174 of this chapter.
