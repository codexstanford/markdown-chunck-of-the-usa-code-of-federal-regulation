In lieu of or in addition to taking action listed in paragraph (b) of this section and to the extent provided in Rule 37(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the administrative law judge or the Commission, upon motion or sua sponte under ยง 210.25, may require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the administrative law judge or the Commission finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this section against the United States, the Commission, or a Commission investigative attorney.

(2) Monetary sanctions may be imposed under this section to reimburse the Commission for expenses incurred by a Commission investigative attorney or the Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations.
