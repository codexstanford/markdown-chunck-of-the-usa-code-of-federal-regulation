(c)-(1)In evaluating whether a competitive benefit exists under section 771A(b) of the Act, the Secretary will determine whether the price for the subsidized input product is lower than the benchmark input price.

(i) The actual price paid by, or offered to, the producer of the subject merchandise for an unsubsidized input product, including an imported input product;

(ii) An average price for an unsubsidized input product, including an imported input product, based upon publicly available data;

(iii) The actual price paid by, or offered to, the producer of the subject merchandise for a subsidized input product, including an imported input product, that is adjusted to account for the countervailable subsidy;

(iv) An average price for a subsidized input product, including an imported input product, based upon publicly available data, that is adjusted to account for the countervailable subsidy; or

(v) An unadjusted price for a subsidized input product or any other surrogate price deemed appropriate by the Secretary.

For purposes of this section, such prices must be reflective of a time period that reasonably corresponds to the time of the purchase of the input.
