###### Item 7-Signature of Carrier's Agent (or Exporter)-

This signature of the authorized agent of the bonded carrier or exporter identified previously (See Item 5) constitutes acceptance of the liability for the in-bond shipment by the party signing. A signature is required except when the in-bond movement is under the bond of the importing carrier. If unsigned, the submission to Customs of an AWB requesting such a movement is evidence of the acceptance of liability if the AWB is approved by Customs.
