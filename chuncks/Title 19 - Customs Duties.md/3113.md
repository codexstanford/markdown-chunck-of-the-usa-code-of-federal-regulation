##### Port,port of entry

and. The terms "port" and "port of entry" refer to any place designated by Executive Order of the President, by order of the Secretary of the Treasury, or by Act of Congress, at which a U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") officer is authorized to accept entries of merchandise to collect duties, and to enforce the various provisions of the customs and navigation laws. The terms "port" and "port of entry" incorporate the geographical area under the jurisdiction of a port director. (The customs ports in the Virgin Islands, although under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury, have their own customs laws (48 U.S.C. 1406(i)). These ports, therefore, are outside the customs territory of the United States and the ports thereof are not "ports of entry" within the meaning of these regulations).
