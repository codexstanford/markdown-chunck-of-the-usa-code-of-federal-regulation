##### Situation 1:

Calculating the regional value content of the finished block

A sub-component is not a heavy-duty automotive good. As referred to in section 10(9)(c), for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the sub-component before it is incorporated into a heavy-duty automotive good, such as when the sub-component is exported from the territory of one NAFTA country to the territory of another NAFTA country, the value of non-originating materials of the sub-component includes only the value of non-originating materials used in the production of that sub-component. Because the block assembly is an originating material, its value is not included in the value of non-originating materials of the finished block, nor is the value of the non-originating crankshaft included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the finished block because the crankshaft was used in the production of the block assembly and was not used in the production of the finished block.
