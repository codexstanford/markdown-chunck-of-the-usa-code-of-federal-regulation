##### De minimis rule for textile goods.

(6)A good of any of Chapters 50 through 60 or heading 96.19, that contains non-originating materials that do not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification requirements, will be considered originating in the territory of a USMCA country if:

(a) The total weight of all those non-originating materials is not more than ten per cent of the total weight of the good, of which the total weight of elastomeric content may not exceed seven per cent of the total weight of the good; and

(b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.

(7) A good of any of Chapters 61 through 63, that contains non-originating fibers or yarns in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification that do not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification requirements, will be considered originating in the territory of a USMCA country if:

(a) The total weight of all those non-originating materials is not more than ten per cent of the total weight of that component, of which the elastomeric content may not exceed seven per cent; and

(b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.

(8) For purposes of subsection (7),

(a) the component of a good that determines the tariff classification of that good is identified in accordance with the first of the following General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System under which the identification can be determined, namely, Rule 3(b), Rule 3(c) and Rule 4; and

(b) if the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good is a blend of two or more yarns or fibers, all yarns and fibers used in the production of the component must be taken into account in determining the weight of fibers and yarns in that component.

(9) For the purpose of determining if a good of Chapter 61 through 63 is originating, the requirements set out in Schedule I (PSRO Annex) only apply to the component that determines the tariff classification of the good. Materials that are not part of the component that determines the tariff classification of the good are disregarded when determining if a good is originating. Similarly, for the purposes of Section 5 as applicable to a good of Chapters 61 through 63, only the materials used in the component that determines the tariff classification are taken into account in the de minimis calculation.

(10) Subsection (6) does not apply to sewing thread, narrow elastic bands, and pocket bag fabric subject to the requirements set out in Chapter 61 Notes 2 through 4, Chapter 62 Notes 3 through 5 or for coated fabric as set out in Chapter 63 Note 2 of Schedule I (PSRO Annex).
