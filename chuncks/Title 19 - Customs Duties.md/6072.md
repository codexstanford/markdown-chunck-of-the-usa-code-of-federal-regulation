###### Status of commercial reports where Customs also tests merchandise.

(ii)Nothing in these regulations will preclude Customs from sampling and testing merchandise from a shipment which has been sampled and tested by a Customs-accredited laboratory at the request of an importer. In cases where a shipment has been analyzed by both Customs and a Customs-accredited laboratory, all Customs actions will be based upon the analysis provided by the Customs laboratory, unless the Executive Director advises otherwise. If Customs tests merchandise, it will release the results of its test to the importer of record or its agent upon request unless the testing information is proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent, or developed by Customs for enforcement purposes.
