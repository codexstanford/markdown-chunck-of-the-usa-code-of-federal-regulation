###### Free entry of replacement articles.

(a)An article furnished by a foreign supplier to replace a like article of comparable value previously exempted from duty under the $800 or $1,600 exemptions for articles acquired abroad will be allowed free entry if the original article is found by the importer to be unsatisfactory and the procedures provided by paragraph (b) of this section are followed. In any case in which the importer has failed to follow these procedures, the port director may allow free entry of the replacement article if he is satisfied that the unsatisfactory article was timely exported and that the failure to comply with the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section was due to inadvertence or lack of experience in customs matters and was without willful intent to avoid CBP supervision.
