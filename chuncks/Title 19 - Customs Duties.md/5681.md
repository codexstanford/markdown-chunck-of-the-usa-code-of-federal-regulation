###### For cause.

(a)The port director may suspend for cause the activated status of a zone or zone site, or the privilege to admit, manufacture, manipulate, exhibit, destroy, transfer or remove merchandise at a zone or zone site for a period not to exceed 90 days. Upon order of the Board the suspension may be continued. If appropriate, the suspension may be limited to an individual user or users and not to the zone or zone site as a whole, or may be limited to a particular activity of an operator or user, such as suspension of the privilege to admit merchandise or the privilege to manufacture. An action to suspend will be taken in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section if:

(1) The approval of the application to activate the zone was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact;

(2) The operator neglects or refuses to obey any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation relating to the operation or administration of a zone;

(3) The operator, or any officer of a corporation which has been granted the right to operate a zone, is convicted of or has commited acts which would constitute a felony, or misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any change in the employment status of the corporate officer (e.g., discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to conviction of a felony or prior to conviction of a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, resulting from acts committed while a corporate officer, will not preclude application of this provision;

(4) The operator fails to furnish a current list of names, addresses, or other information as required by ยง 146.7;

(5) The operator does not provide a secure facility or properly safeguard merchandise within a zone;

(6) [Reserved]

(7) The operator, or any officer, agent, or employee of the operator, discloses to an unauthorized person proprietary information contained on a Customs form or in the inventory control and recordkeeping system; or

(8) The inventory control and recordkeeping system is impaired to the point where the identity of merchandise in zone status has been lost and cannot be reestablished without a suspension of zone operations.
