(c)-(1)An in-bond application must be filed pursuant to ยง 18.1 of this chapter prior to or upon arrival at a U.S. port. At CBP's discretion the driver may be required to present four validated copies of the United States-Canada Transit Manifest, CBP Form 7512-B Canada 8, to the CBP officer, who will review the manifest for accuracy and verify its validation by Canadian Customs. If the manifest is found not to be validated properly, the truck will be required to be returned to the Canadian port of departure so that the manifest may be validated in accordance with Canadian Customs regulations. If the manifest is validated properly and no irregularity is found, the truck will be sealed unless sealing is waived by CBP. The CBP officer will note in the in-bond record and, if paper, on the manifest, the seal numbers or the waiver of sealing, retain the original, and return three copies of the manifest to the driver for presentation to CBP at the U.S. port of exportation.
