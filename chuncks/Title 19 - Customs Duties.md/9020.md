##### infra,

2. Because the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) that is to be designated as the basis for drawback is dutiable according to its value, the amount of duty can vary with its size (gauge, width, or length) or composition (e.g., chrome content). If such variances occur, designation will be by "price extra", and in no case will drawback be claimed in a greater amount than that which would have accrued to that steel used in manufacture of or appearing in the exported articles. Price extra is not available for coated or plated steel, covered in paragraph 5,insofar as the coating or plating is concerned.

3. The duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be so similar in quality to the steel used to manufacture the articles on which drawback will be claimed that the steel so used, if imported, would be classifiable in the same tariff subheading number and at the same rate of duty as the duty-paid imported steel.

4. Any fluctuation in market value caused by a factor other than quality does not affect drawback.

5. If the steel is coated or plated with a base metal, in addition to meeting the requirements for uncoated or unplated steel set forth in the parallel columns, the base-metal coating or plating on the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used in place of the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will have the same composition and thickness as the coating or plating on the duty-paid steel. If the coated or plated duty-paid steel is within a SAE, AISI, ASTM specification, any duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic coated or plated steel covered by the same specification and grade (if two or more grades are in the specification) is considered to meet this criterion for "same kind and quality."

The exported articles will have been manufactured in the United States using steels described in the parallel columns above.

The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see ยง 191.9 of this part).

The steel described in the parallel columns will be used to manufacture or produce articles in accordance with ยง 191.2(q) of this part.

Not applicable.

No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of steel appearing in the exported articles, records will be maintained to establish the value (or the lack of value), the quantity, and the disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records to establish that fact will be maintained.

The manufacturer or producer will maintain records showing the extent of any loss or gain in net weight or measurement of the steel caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.

The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.

Records will be maintained to establish:

1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;

2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandiseused to produce the exported articles;

3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer producedthe exported articles.

To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer will show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading "Procedures And Records Maintained". If those records do not establish satisfaction of those legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.

Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of steel used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible steel that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste from each lot of steel, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible steel used to produce the exported articles less the amount of that steel which the value of the waste would replace.

The manufacturer or producer will:

1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;

2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;

3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;

4. Keep its letter of notification to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;

5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and

6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.

The sugars listed above test within three-tenths of a degree on the polariscope. Sugars in each column are completely interchangeable with the sugars directly opposite and designation will be made on this basis only. The designated sugar on which claims for drawback will be based will be so similar in quality to the sugar used in manufacture of the products exported with drawback that the sugar used in manufacture would, if imported, be subject to the same amount of duty paid on a like quantity of designated sugar. Differences in value resulting from factors other than quality, such as market fluctuation, will not affect the allowance of drawback.

Edible substances (including confectionery) and/or beverages and/or ingredients therefor.

The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see ยง 191.9 of this part).

Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the quantity of rag waste, if any, its value, and its disposition. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records will also be kept. If no waste results, records will be maintained to establish that fact. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the woven piece goods put into process.

Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such records for shrinkage, gain, and spoilage will also be kept.
