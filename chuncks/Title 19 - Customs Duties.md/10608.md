###### see

(i) If the Secretary determines upon review of a request for a circumvention inquiry that a scope ruling is warranted before the Secretary can conduct a circumvention analysis, the Secretary may either initiate the circumvention inquiry under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and address the scope issue in the circumvention inquiry (ยง 351.225(i)(1)), or defer initiation of the circumvention inquiry pending the completion of any ongoing or new segment of the proceeding addressing the scope issue. When initiation is deferred pending another segment of the proceeding, if the result of that other segment is that the product at issue is not covered by the scope of the antidumping and/or countervailing duty order(s) at issue, the Secretary may immediately initiate the circumvention inquiry upon the issuance of the final decision in that other segment; or

(ii) If the Secretary determines upon review of the request for a circumvention inquiry that the circumvention issue should be addressed in an ongoing segment of the proceeding, such as a covered merchandise inquiry under ยง 351.227, rather than initiating a circumvention inquiry, the Secretary will notify the requestor of its intent to address the circumvention issue in such other segment.
