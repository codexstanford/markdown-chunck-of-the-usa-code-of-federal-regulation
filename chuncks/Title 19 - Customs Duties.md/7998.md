means costs, other than direct material costs and direct labor costs.

2 (1) In this Schedule, reference to "producer", for purposes of subsection 4(8) of Schedule III, is to be read as a reference to "buyer".

(2) In this Schedule, a reference to "good",

(a) for purposes of subsection 7(15) of these Regulations, is to be read as a reference to "identical goods or similar goods, or any combination thereof";

(b) for purposes of subsection 8(8) of these Regulations, is to be read as a reference to "intermediate material";

(c) for purposes of section 16 of these Regulations, is to be read as a reference to "category of vehicles that is chosen pursuant to subsection 16(1) of these Regulations";

(d) for purposes of subsection 4(8) of Schedule III, be read as a reference to "packaging materials and containers or the elements"; and

(e) for purposes of subsection 4(8) of Schedule VI, be read as a reference to "elements".

3 (1) If a producer of a good is using, for an internal management purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good direct material costs, or part thereof, and that method reasonably reflects the direct material used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method must be used to reasonably allocate the costs to the good.

(2) If a producer of a good is using, for an internal management purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good direct labor costs, or part thereof, and that method reasonably reflects the direct labor used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method must be used to reasonably allocate the costs to the good.

(3) If a producer of a good is using, for an internal management purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good overhead, or part thereof, and that method is based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method must be used to reasonably allocate the costs to the good.

4 If costs are not reasonably allocated to a good under section 3, those costs are reasonably allocated to the good if they are allocated:

(a) With respect to direct material costs, on the basis of any method that reasonably reflects the direct material used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear;

(b) with respect to direct labor costs, on the basis of any method that reasonably reflects the direct labor used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear; and

(c) with respect to overhead, on the basis of any of the following methods:

(i) The method set out in Appendix A, B or C,

(ii) a method based on a combination of the methods set out in Appendices A and B or Appendices A and C, and

(iii) a cost allocation method based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear.

5 Notwithstanding sections 3 and 8, if a producer allocates, for an internal management purpose, costs to a good that is not produced in the period in which the costs are expensed on the books of the producer (such as costs with respect to research and development, and obsolete materials), those costs must be considered reasonably allocated if:

(a) For purposes of subsection 7(11) of these Regulations, they are allocated to a good that is produced in the period in which the costs are expensed, and

(b) the good produced in that period is within a group or range of goods, including identical goods or similar goods, that is produced by the same industry or industry sector as the goods to which the costs are expensed.

6 Any cost allocation method referred to in section 3, 4 or 5 that is used by a producer for the purposes of these Regulations must be used throughout the producer's fiscal year.

7 The allocation to a good of any of the following is considered not to be reasonably allocated to the good:

(a) Costs of a service provided by a producer of a good to another person where the service is not related to the good;

(b) gains or losses resulting from the disposition of a discontinued operation, except gains or losses related to the production of the good;

(c) cumulative effects of accounting changes reported in accordance with a specific requirement of the applicable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; and

(d) gains or losses resulting from the sale of a capital asset of the producer.

8 Any costs allocated under section 3 on the basis of a cost allocation method that is used for an internal management purpose that is solely for the purpose of qualifying a good as an originating good are considered not to be reasonably allocated.

For the overhead to be allocated, the producer may choose one or more allocation bases that reflect a relationship between the overhead and the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear.

With respect to each allocation base that is chosen by the producer for allocating overhead, a cost ratio is calculated for each good produced by the producer as determined by the formula:

The costs with respect to which an allocation base is chosen are allocated to a good in accordance with the following formula:

Under paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations, where excluded costs are included in costs to be allocated to a good, the cost ratio used to allocate that cost to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the costs allocated to the good.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of allocation bases that may be used by the producer to calculate cost ratios:

For each good produced by the producer, a direct labor and direct material ratio is calculated by the formula:

Overhead is allocated to a good by the formula:

Under paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations, if excluded costs are included in overhead to be allocated to a good, the direct labor and direct material ratio used to allocate overhead to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the overhead allocated to the good.

Direct overhead is allocated to a good on the basis of a method based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear.

Indirect overhead is allocated on the basis of a direct cost ratio.

For each good produced by the producer, a direct cost ratio is calculated by the formula:

Indirect overhead is allocated to a good by the formula:

Under paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations, if excluded costs are included in

(a) direct overhead to be allocated to a good, those excluded costs are subtracted from the direct overhead allocated to the good; and

(b) indirect overhead to be allocated to a good, the direct cost ratio used to allocate indirect overhead to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the indirect overhead allocated to the good.

1 (1) Unless otherwise stated, the following definitions apply in this Schedule.
