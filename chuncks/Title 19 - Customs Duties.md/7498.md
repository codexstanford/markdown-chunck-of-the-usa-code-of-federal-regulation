###### NAFTA transaction

(5) Ais an act or activity to which the NAFTA provisions apply. A "prospective" NAFTA transaction is one that is merely contemplated or is currently being undertaken but has not resulted in any arrival or in the filing of any entry or entry summary or other document or in any other act so as to bring the transaction, or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs office. A "current" NAFTA transaction is one which is presently under consideration by a field office of Customs. A "completed" NAFTA transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs field office and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest or other review as provided in the applicable Customs laws and regulations. An "ongoing" NAFTA transaction is a series of identical, recurring transactions, consisting of current and completed transactions where future transactions are contemplated.
