##### Customs acceptance.

(e)Seals will be considered as acceptable for use and/or purchase by U.S. Customs as soon as the manufacturer attests that the seals have been tested and meet or exceed the standards provided in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, and will continue to be considered acceptable until such time as it is demonstrated that they do not meet the standards. A manufacturer may attest to the qualification of a specific seal, or to an entire product line of seals as of a certain date. Any addition of a seal to a group of seals attested to as a group would require specific acceptance of that seal by Customs.
