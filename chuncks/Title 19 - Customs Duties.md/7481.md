(d)Where Customs determines, either as a result of an origin verification initiated under ยง 181.72(a) of this part or under any other circumstance, that a certain good imported into the United States does not qualify as an originating good based on a tariff classification or a value applied in the United States to one or more materials used in the production of the good, including a material used in the production of another material that is used in the production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or value applied to the materials by the country from which the good was exported, the Customs determination shall not become effective until Customs provides written notification thereof both to the U.S. importer of the good and to the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based.
