###### General.

(a)A person submitting a request for an advance ruling and desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved should indicate that desire in writing at the time the advance ruling request is filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the advance ruling request is under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary to that advocated in the advance ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the advance ruling request. Accordingly, the parties will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or agreed to, expressly or by implication, during the conference unless either party subsequently agrees to be so bound in writing. The conference will not conclude with the issuance of an advance ruling letter.
