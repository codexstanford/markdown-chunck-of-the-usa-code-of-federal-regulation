## Chapter III - International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce
### PART 356 - PROCEDURES AND RULES FOR ARTICLE 10.12 OF THE UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
#### Subpart D - Violation of a Protective Order or a Disclosure Undertaking
##### ยง 356.16 Charging letter.
###### Settlement and amendment of the charging letter.

(b)The Deputy Under Secretary may amend, supplement, or withdraw the charging letter at any time with the approval of an administrative law judge if the interests of justice would thereby be served. If a hearing has not been requested, the Deputy Under Secretary will ask the Under Secretary to appoint an administrative law judge to make this determination. If a charging letter is withdrawn after a request for a hearing, the administrative law judge will determine whether the withdrawal will bar the Deputy Under Secretary from seeking sanctions at a later date for the same alleged violation. If there has been no request for a hearing, or if supporting information has not been submitted under ยง 356.28, the withdrawal will not bar future actions on the same alleged violation. The Deputy Under Secretary and a charged or affected party may settle a charge brought under this subpart by mutual agreement at any time after service of the charging letter; approval of the administrative law judge or the APO Sanctions Board is not necessary.
