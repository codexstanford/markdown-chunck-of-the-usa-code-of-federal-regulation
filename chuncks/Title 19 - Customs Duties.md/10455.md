##### ยง 351.215 Expedited antidumping review and security in lieu of estimated duty under section 736(c) of the Act.
###### Introduction.

(a)Exporters and producers individually examined in an investigation normally cannot obtain a review of entries until an administrative review is requested. In addition, when an antidumping order is published, importers normally must begin to make a cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties upon the entry of subject merchandise. Section 736(c), however, establishes a special procedure under which exporters or producers may request an expedited review, and bonds, rather than cash deposits, may continue to be posted for a limited period of time if several criteria are satisfied. This section contains rules regarding requests for expedited antidumping reviews and the procedures applicable to such reviews.
