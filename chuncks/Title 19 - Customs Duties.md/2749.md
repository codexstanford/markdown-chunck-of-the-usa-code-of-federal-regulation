##### ยง 19.12 Inventory control and recordkeeping system.
###### Maintenance of FIFO.

(4)FIFO procedures used for merchandise in any inventory category, must be used consistently throughout the warehouse storage and recordkeeping practices and procedures for the merchandise. For example, merchandise may not be added to inventory by FIFO but withdrawn by bypassing certain inventory layers to reach a specific warehouse entry other than the oldest one. However, this does not preclude the use of specific identification for some merchandise in a warehouse entry and FIFO for other merchandise, so long as they are segregated in physical storage and clearly distinguished in the inventory and accounting records.
