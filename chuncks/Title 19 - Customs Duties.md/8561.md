(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 190.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)

(The exact material placed under this heading in individual cases will vary, but it should include such information as the type of business in which the manufacturer is engaged, whether the manufacturer is manufacturing for its own account or is performing the operation on a toll basis (including commission or conversion basis) for the account of others, whether the manufacturer is a direct exporter of its products or sells or delivers them to others for export, and whether drawback will be claimed by the manufacturer or by others.)
