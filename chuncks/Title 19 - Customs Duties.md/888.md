###### ยง 10.471 Special rule for verifications in Chile of U.S. imports of textile and apparel products.
####### Procedures to determine whether a claim of origin is accurate.

(a)For the purpose of determining that a claim of origin for a textile or apparel good is accurate, CBP may request that the government of Chile conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP may take appropriate action, as directed by The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), which may include suspending the application of preferential treatment to the textile or apparel good for which a claim of origin has been made. If CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, CBP may take appropriate action with respect to the textile and apparel good subject to the verification, and with respect to similar goods exported or produced by the entity that exported or produced the good, if directed by CITA.
