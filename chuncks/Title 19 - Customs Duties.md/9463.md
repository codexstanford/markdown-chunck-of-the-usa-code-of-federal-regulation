If the President, under section 302(b) of the USMCA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 4552(b)), has excluded imports from a USMCA country or countries from an action under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, any entity that is representative of an industry for which such action is being taken may request the Commission to conduct an investigation to determine whether a surge in such imports undermines the effectiveness of the action.
