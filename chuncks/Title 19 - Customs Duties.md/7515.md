Where the net cost method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: a list of all product, period and other costs relevant to determining the total cost of the good as defined in the appendix to this part; a list of all excluded costs to be subtracted from the total cost of the good as provided in the appendix to this part; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used in the production of the good, in accordance with section 7 of the appendix to this part; the basis for any allocation of costs in accordance with schedule VII of the appendix to this part; the period over which the net cost calculation is to be made; and any other information relevant to determining the appropriate value of any cost under this part. Where the advance ruling request concerns only the calculation of an element of a regional value content formula, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only contain the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), other than the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii); the information in paragraph (b)(5); and any information in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request.
