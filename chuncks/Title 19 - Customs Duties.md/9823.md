####### Nonconfidential summaries.

(b)Except as the Commission may otherwise provide, a party submitting confidential business information shall also submit to the Commission, at the time that it submits such information, a nonconfidential summary of the information. If a party indicates that the confidential business information cannot be summarized, it shall state in writing the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. If the Commission finds that a request for confidentiality is not warranted, and if the party concerned is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summarized form, the Commission may disregard the submission.
