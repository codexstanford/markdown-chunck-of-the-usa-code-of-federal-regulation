### PART 4 - VESSELS IN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADES
#### Arrival and Entry of Vessels
##### ยง 4.14 Equipment purchases for, and repairs to, American vessels.
###### Time limit for submitting evidence of cost.

(f)A complete vessel repair entry must be supported by evidence showing the cost of each item entered. If the entry is incomplete when submitted, evidence to make it complete must be received by the VRU as identified in paragraph (g) of this section within 150 calendar days from the date of vessel arrival. That evidence must include the final cost of repairs. In the event that all final cost evidence is not furnished within 150 days, or is of doubtful authenticity, the VRU may refer the matter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to begin procedures to obtain the needed evidence. That agency may also investigate the reason for a failure to file or for an untimely submission. Unexplained or unjustified delays in providing CBP with sufficient information to properly determine duty may result in penalty action as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
