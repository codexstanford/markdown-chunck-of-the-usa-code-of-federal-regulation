####### Importer requirements.

(b)In order to make a claim for preferential tariff treatment under ยง 10.235, the importer:

(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the article qualifies for preferential tariff treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential tariff treatment because it meets the applicable rule of origin set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to part 181 of this chapter. A properly completed Certificate of Origin in the form prescribed in ยง 10.236(b) is a record that would serve this purpose;

(2) Must establish and implement internal controls which provide for the periodic review of the accuracy of the Certificate of Origin or other records referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

(3) Must have shipping papers that show how the article moved from the CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States. If the imported article was shipped through a country other than a CBTPA beneficiary country and the invoices and other documents from the CBTPA beneficiary country do not show the United States as the final destination, the importer also must have documentation that demonstrates that the conditions set forth in ยง 10.233(d)(3)(i) through (iii) were met; and

(4) Must be prepared to explain, upon request from Customs, how the records and internal controls referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section justify the importer's claim for preferential tariff treatment.
