(3)No part of the advance ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and part 103 of this chapter, or shall be deemed to be subject to the confidentiality principle set forth in ยง 181.121 of this part, unless, as provided in ยง 181.93(b)(7) of this part, the information claimed to be exempt from disclosure is clearly identified and a valid basis for nondisclosure is set forth. Before the issuance of the advance ruling letter, the person submitting the advance ruling request will be notified of any decision adverse to his request for nondisclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the advance ruling request. If in the opinion of Customs an impasse exists on the issue of confidentiality and the person who submitted the advance ruling request does not withdraw the request, Customs will decline to issue the advance ruling. All advance ruling letters issued by Customs will be available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).
