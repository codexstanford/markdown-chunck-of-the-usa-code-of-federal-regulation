###### information letter

(4) Anis a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that does no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation of principles under the NAFTA, without applying it to a specific set of facts. If Customs believes that general information may be of some benefit to the person making the request, an information letter may be issued in response to a request for an advance ruling when:

(i) The request suggests that general information, rather than an advance ruling, is actually being sought;

(ii) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart; or

(iii) The requested advance ruling cannot be issued for any other reason.
