##### Aggravating Factors.

(5)Certain factors may be determined to be aggravating factors in calculating the amount of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the final administrative penalty. The presence of one or more aggravating factors may not be used to raise the level of culpability attributable to the alleged violations, but may be used to offset the presence of mitigating factors. The following factors will be considered "aggravating factors", provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.

(a) Obstructing an investigation or audit.

(b) Withholding evidence.

(c) Providing misleading information concerning the violation.

(d) Prior substantive violations of section 593A for which a final administrative finding of culpability has been made.

(e) Failure to comply with a Customs summons or lawful demand for records.
