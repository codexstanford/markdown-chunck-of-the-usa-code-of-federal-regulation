## Chapter I - U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security; Department of the Treasury
### PART 24 - CUSTOMS FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE
#### ยง 24.26 Automated Clearinghouse credit.
##### Procedures for daily statement filers.

(2)The procedures set forth in ยง 24.25(c) for ABI filers using statement processing remain applicable when payment is effected through ACH credit. However, when the ABI filer is a customs broker who is not the importer of record and thus is not responsible for the payment, the ABI filer must provide the statement number and statement amount to the importer of record at least one business day prior to the due date so that the importer of record can originate the payment.
