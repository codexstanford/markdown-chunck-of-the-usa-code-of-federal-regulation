(g)Duty-free store proprietors must maintain, at the duty-free store or at another location approved by the port director, a current inventory separately for each storage area, crib, and sales area containing conditionally duty-free merchandise by warehouse entry, or by unique identifier where permitted by the port director. Proprietors must assure that CBP has ready access to those records, and that the records are stored in such a way as to keep transactions of multiple facilities separated. The inventory must be reconcilable with the accounting and inventory records and the permit file folder requirements of § 19.12 (d), (e) and (f) of this part. Proprietors are subject also to the recordkeeping requirements of other paragraphs of § 19.12, as well as those of §§ 19.6(d), 19.37(d), 19.39(d) of this part, and 144.37(h)(3) of this chapter.
