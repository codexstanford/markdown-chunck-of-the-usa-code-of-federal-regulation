###### General.

(a)Section 4.3 provides which vessels are subject to formal entry and where and when entry must be made. The formal entry of an American vessel is governed by section 434, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1434). The term "American vessel" means a vessel of the United States (see ยง 4.0(b)) as well as, when arriving by sea, a vessel entitled to be documented except for its size (see ยง 4.0(c)). The formal entry of a foreign vessel arriving within the limits of any CBP port is also governed by section 434, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1434). Alternatively, information necessary for formal entry may be transmitted electronically pursuant to a system authorized by CBP.
