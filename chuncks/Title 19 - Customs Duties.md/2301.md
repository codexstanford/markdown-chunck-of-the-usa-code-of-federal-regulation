(a)Merchandise detained pursuant to ยง 12.42(e) may be exported at any time prior to seizure pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or before it is deemed to have been abandoned as provided in this section, whichever occurs first. Provided no finding has been issued by the Commissioner of CBP under ยง 12.42(f) and the merchandise has not been exported within 3 months after the date of importation, the port director will ascertain whether the proof specified in ยง 12.43 has been submitted within the time prescribed in that section.

Upon the expiration of 60 days after the delivery or mailing of such advice by the port director, the merchandise will be deemed to have been abandoned and will be destroyed, unless it has been exported or a protest has been filed as provided for in section 514, Tariff Act of 1930.
