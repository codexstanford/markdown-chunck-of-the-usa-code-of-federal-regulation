###### Introduction.

(a)The URAA added a new procedure, commonly referred to as "sunset reviews," in section 751(c) of the Act. In general, no later than once every five years, the Secretary must determine whether dumping or countervailable subsidies would be likely to continue or resume if an order were revoked or a suspended investigation were terminated. The Commission must conduct a similar review to determine whether injury would be likely to continue or resume in the absence of an order or suspended investigation. If the determinations under section 751(c) of both the Secretary and the Commission are affirmative, the order (or suspended investigation) remains in place. If either determination is negative, the order will be revoked (or the suspended investigation will be terminated). This section contains rules regarding the procedures for sunset reviews.
