####### Waiver of specific details for each entry.

(d)There are cases where large quantities of United States components are purchased from various sources or exported at various ports and dates on a continuing basis, so that it is impractical to identify the exact source, port and date of export for each particular component included in an entry of merchandise claimed to be subject to the exemption under subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202). In these cases, specific details such as the port and date of export and the name of the manufacturer of the United States components may be waived if the Center director is satisfied that the importer and assembler have established reliable controls to insure that all components for which the exemption is claimed are in fact products of the United States. These controls shall include strict physical segregation of United States and foreign components, as well as records of United States components showing quantities, sources, costs, dates shipped abroad, and other necessary information. These records shall be maintained by the importer and assembler for 5 years from the date of the released entry in a manner so that they are readily available for audit, inspection, copying, reproduction or other official use by authorized Customs officers.
