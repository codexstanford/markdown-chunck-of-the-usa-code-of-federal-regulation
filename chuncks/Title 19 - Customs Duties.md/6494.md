(d)Certifications are subject to verification. Parties, therefore, are required to maintain the accounting records used in developing their claims, for a period of five years after the filing of the certification. The records supporting certifications must be those that are normally kept in the ordinary course of business (see ยง 163.1(a)(1) and (a)(2)(vi) of this chapter). Parties must be able to demonstrate that their records specifically support each qualifying expenditure enumerated in a certification. In addition, the claimant must be able to support how qualifying expenditures are determined to be related to the production of the product covered by the order or finding.
