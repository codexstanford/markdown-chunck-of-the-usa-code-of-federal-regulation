###### TIR carnets.

(3)The port director will cause a CBP seal to be affixed to a container or road vehicle that is being used to transport merchandise under cover of a TIR carnet unless the container or road vehicle bears a customs seal (domestic or foreign). The port director will likewise cause a CBP seal or label to be affixed to heavy or bulky goods being so transported. If, however, the port director has reason to believe that there is a discrepancy between the merchandise listed on the Goods Manifest of the carnet and the merchandise that is to be transported, the port director may cause a CBP seal or label to be affixed only when the listing of the merchandise in the carnet and a physical inventory agree.
