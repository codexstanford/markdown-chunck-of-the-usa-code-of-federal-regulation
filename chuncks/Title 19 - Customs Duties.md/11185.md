###### Hearing procedures.

(c)Hearings will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit attendance at any hearing or portion thereof if necessary or advisable in order to protect proprietary information from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law shall not apply, and all evidentiary material the administrative law judge determines to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious may be received into evidence and given appropriate weight. The administrative law judge may make such orders and determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence, conduct of examination and cross-examination, and similar matters as are necessary or appropriate to ensure orderliness in the proceedings. The administrative law judge will ensure that a record of the hearing will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, and will order such part of the record to be sealed as is necessary to protect proprietary information.
