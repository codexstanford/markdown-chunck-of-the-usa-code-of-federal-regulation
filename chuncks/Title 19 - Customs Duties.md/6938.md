###### Normal and customary manner.

(4)"Normal and customary manner" means that inquiry suggested by particular facts and circumstances which would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether a petitioner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how property would be used by another legally in possession of the property.
