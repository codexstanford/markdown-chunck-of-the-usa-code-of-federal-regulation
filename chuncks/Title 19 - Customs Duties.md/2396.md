(d)If a declaration filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section states that the entry is being made under circumstances described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the entry shall be accepted only if the owner or importer of record gives a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in ยง 113.62 of this chapter, for the production of a notification from the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his designee, in accordance with 21 CFR 1005.23, that the electronic product described in the declaration filed by the importer of record is in compliance with the applicable standards. The bond shall be in an amount deemed appropriate by the port director. Within 180 days after the entry of such additional period as the port director may allow for good cause shown, the importer of record shall take any action necessary to insure delivery to the port director of the notification described in this paragraph. If the notification is not delivered to the director of the port of entry of the electronic products within 180 days of the date of entry or such additional period as may be allowed by the port director, for good cause shown, the importer of record shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the port director those electronic products which were released. In the event that any electronic products are not redelivered to Customs custody or exported under Customs supervision within the period allowed by the port director in the Notice of Redelivery (Customs Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent), liquidated damages shall be assessed in the full amount of a bond if it is a single entry bond, or if a continuous bond is used, the amount that would have been taken under a single entry bond.
