##### Articles Assembled Abroad With United States Components
###### § 10.25 Textile components cut to shape in the United States and assembled abroad.

Where a textile component is cut to shape (but not to length, width, or both) in the United States from foreign fabric and exported to another country, territory, or insular possession for assembly into an article that is then returned to the United States and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1996, the value of the textile component shall not be included in the dutiable value of the article. For purposes of determining whether a reduction in the dutiable value of an imported article may be allowed under this section:

(a) The terms "textile component" and "fabric" have reference only to goods covered by the definition of "textile or apparel product" set forth in § 102.21(b)(5) of this chapter;

(b) The operations performed abroad on the textile component shall conform to the requirements and examples set forth in § 10.16 insofar as they may be applicable to a textile component; and

(c) The valuation and documentation provisions of §§ 10.17, 10.18, 10.21 and 10.24 shall apply.
