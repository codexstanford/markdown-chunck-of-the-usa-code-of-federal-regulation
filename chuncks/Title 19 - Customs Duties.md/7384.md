###### Substitution manufacturing drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b).

(d)Upon presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), on which the amount of drawback payable is based on the lesser amount of the customs duties paid on the good either to the United States or to Canada or Mexico, the amount of drawback is the same as that which would have been allowed had the substituted merchandise used in manufacture been itself imported. For purposes of drawback under this subpart, the term "same kind and quality" used in ยง 1313(b) (see ยง 191.2(x)(1) of this chapter) shall have the same meaning as the term "identical or similar good" used in Article 303 of the NAFTA except that there shall be no requirement that the good be manufactured in the same country.
