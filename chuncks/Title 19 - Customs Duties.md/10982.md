####### Calculation of ad valorem subsidy rate.,ad valorem,e.g.,

(a)The Secretary will calculate ansubsidy rate by dividing the amount of the benefit allocated to the period of investigation or review by the sales value during the same period of the product or products to which the Secretary attributes the subsidy under paragraph (b) of this section. Normally, the Secretary will determine the sales value of a product on an f.o.b. (port) basis (if the product is exported) or on an f.o.b. (factory) basis (if the product is sold for domestic consumption). However, if the Secretary determines that countervailable subsidies are provided with respect to the movement of a product from the port or factory to the place of destination (freight or insurance costs are subsidized), the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments to the sales value used in the denominator.
