"Crew member" means a pilot, copilot, flight engineer, airline management personnel authorized to travel in the cockpit, cabin crew, and relief crew (also known as "deadheading crew"). However, for all other purposes of immigration law and documentary evidence required under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101,), "crew member" (or "crewman") means a person serving onboard an aircraft in good faith in any capacity required for the normal operation and service of the flight (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(10) and (a)(15)(D), as applicable). In addition, the definition of "crew member" applicable to this section should not be applied in the context of other customs laws, to the extent this definition differs from the meaning of "crew member" contemplated in such other customs laws.
