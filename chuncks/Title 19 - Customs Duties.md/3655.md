(2) The CBP regulations concerning the maintenance of inventory control and recordkeeping systems covering merchandise in the foreign trade zone or subzone.

It is understood and agreed that whether the default involves merchandise is a determination made by CBP, that the amount to be collected under this condition will be based upon the quantity and value of the merchandise as determined by CBP, and that value as used in these provisions means value as determined under 19 U.S.C. 1401a. If the principal defaults and the default does not involve merchandise, the obligors agree to pay liquidated damages of $1,000 for each default, or such other amount as may be authorized by law or regulations.
