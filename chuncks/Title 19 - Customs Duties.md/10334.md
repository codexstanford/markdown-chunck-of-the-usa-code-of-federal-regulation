###### Relatively short period.

(i)Under section 705(a)(2)(B) or section 735(a)(3)(B) of the Act, the Secretary normally will consider a "relatively short period" as the period beginning on the date the proceeding begins and ending at least three months later. However, if the Secretary finds that importers, or exporters or producers, had reason to believe, at some time prior to the beginning of the proceeding, that a proceeding was likely, then the Secretary may consider a period of not less than three months from that earlier time.
