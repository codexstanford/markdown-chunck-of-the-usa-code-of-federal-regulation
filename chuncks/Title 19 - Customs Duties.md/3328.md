###### Change in ownership.

(e)If the ownership of a broker changes and ownership shares in the broker are not publicly traded, the broker must immediately provide written notice of that fact to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, and must send a copy of the written notice to the processing Center. When a change in ownership results in the addition of a new principal to the organization, and whether or not ownership shares in the broker are publicly traded, CBP reserves the right to conduct a background investigation on the new principal. The processing Center will notify the broker if CBP objects to the new principal, and the broker will be given a reasonable period of time to remedy the situation. If the background investigation uncovers information which would have been the basis for a denial of an application for a broker's license and the principal's interest in the broker is not terminated to the satisfaction of the processing Center, suspension or revocation proceedings may be initiated under subpart D of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, a "principal" means any person having at least a five (5) percent capital, beneficiary or other direct or indirect interest in the business of a broker.
