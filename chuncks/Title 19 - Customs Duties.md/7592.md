##### Situation 4:

Use of the material in a self-produced automotive component

If the engine is a self-produced material rather than an acquired material, the heavy-duty vehicle producer is using the rocker arm assembly in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle rather than in the production of the engine, because, under section 7(4), the engine cannot be designated as an intermediate material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value, under section 10(1)(f), of the rocker arm assembly is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.

A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component.
