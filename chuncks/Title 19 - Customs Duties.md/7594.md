##### Situation:

Use of the automotive component assembly

The automotive component assembly is acquired by a producer who uses it in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is an originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under any of section 10(1)(d) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.) If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is a non-originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under section 10(1)(e) (i) or (ii). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.)

Regardless of whether the automotive component assembly is an originating material or a non-originating material, the value of the automotive component that was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is a non-originating material, and, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of an automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that transmission, the value of the transmission is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates it.

An aluminum ingot, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of cast block that will be used in an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The aluminum ingot is not a listed material; the cast block is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component.
