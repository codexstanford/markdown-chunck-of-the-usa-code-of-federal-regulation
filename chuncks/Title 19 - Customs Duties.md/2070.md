####### Example.,see

Panamanian producer A produces good C. Producer A ships good C to the United States in a shipping container that it purchased from Company B in Panama. The shipping container is originating. The value of the shipping container determined under ยง 10.2016(a)(2) is $3. Good C is subject to a regional value content requirement. The transaction value of good C is $100, which includes the $3 shipping container. The U.S. importer decides to use the build-up method, RVC= (VOM/AV) x 100 (ยง 10.2015(c))), in determining whether good C satisfies the regional value content requirement. In determining the AV, adjusted value, of good C imported into the U.S., paragraph (b) of this section and the definition of AV require a $3 deduction for the value of the shipping container. Therefore, the AV is $97 ($100-$3). In addition, the value of the shipping container is disregarded and not included in the VOM, value of originating materials.
