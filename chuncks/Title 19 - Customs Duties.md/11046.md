#### ยง 354.10 Discovery.
##### Interrogatories and requests for admissions or production of documents.

(b)A party may serve on any other party interrogatories, requests for admissions, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and a party concerned may then apply to the presiding official for such enforcement or administrative protective order as that party deems warranted concerning such discovery. The party will serve a discovery request at least 20 days before the scheduled date of a hearing, if a hearing has been requested and scheduled, unless the presiding official specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents and responses thereto will be served on all parties. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested will be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 days after the date of service of the request, or within such further time as the presiding official may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either admitting or denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
