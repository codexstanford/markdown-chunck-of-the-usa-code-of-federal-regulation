### PART 181 - NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
#### Subpart G - Origin Verifications and Determinations
##### ยง 181.76 Application of origin determinations.
###### Cases involving a pattern of conduct.

(c)Where multiple origin verifications initiated under ยง 181.72(a) of this part indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer involving false or unsupported representations on Certificates of Origin that a good imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good, Customs may deny subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment on identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with the rules applicable to originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part, provided that advance written notice of the intent to deny such claims is given to the importer. For purposes of this paragraph, a "pattern of conduct" means repeated instances of false or unsupported representations by an exporter or producer as established by Customs on the basis of not fewer than two origin verifications of two or more importations of the good that result in the issuance of not fewer than two written determinations issued to that exporter or producer pursuant to ยง 181.75 of this part which conclude, as a finding of fact, that Certificates of Origin completed and signed by that exporter or producer with respect to identical goods contain false or unsupported representations.
