###### Can existing Customs-accredited laboratories continue to operate?

(i)Commercial laboratories accredited by the Executive Director prior to December 8, 1993, will retain that accreditation under these regulations provided they conduct their business in a manner consistent with the administrative portions of this section. This paragraph does not pertain to any laboratory which has had its accreditation suspended or revoked. Laboratories which have had their accreditations continued under this section will have their status reevaluated on their next triennial inspection date which is no earlier than three years after the effective date of this regulation. At the time of reaccreditation, these laboratories must meet the requirements of this section and remit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period, the fixed reaccreditation fee. Failure to meet these requirements will result in revocation or suspension of the accreditation.
