## Chapter I - U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security; Department of the Treasury
### PART 101 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
#### ยง 101.10 Centers of Excellence and Expertise.
##### Assignment of importers to the Centers

(b). Generally, each importer will be assigned to an industry-category administered by a specific Center based on the tariff classification in the HTSUS of the predominant number of goods imported. The list of HTSUS numbers that will be used by CBP for the importer's placement in a Center is the same list of HTSUS numbers that are referenced in the definition for Centers (see ยง 101.1). Factors that may cause CBP to place an importer in a Center not based on the tariff classification of the predominant number of goods imported include the importer's associated business practices within an industry, the intended use of the predominant number of goods imported, or the high relative value of goods imported.
