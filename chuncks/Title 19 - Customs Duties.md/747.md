###### Originating materials for which no price paid.

(ii)In cases involving a vertically integrated producer (that is, an entity which produces goods for export from materials which that producer has also made) a "price paid" for such originating materials normally does not exist. Even in the absence of a "price paid", such a vertically integrated producer may still claim the materials as originating materials for purposes of qualifying the finished goods exported to the United States as goods originating in Canada. However, under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section the value of those materials for purposes of applying the value-content requirement is limited to the price paid for those materials imported from the third country plus any costs added thereto under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The following examples will illustrate these principles.
