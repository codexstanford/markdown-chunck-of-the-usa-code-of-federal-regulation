###### Evidence of sale for export and placement for through shipment.

(iii)A sale for export and placement for through shipment to the United States under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section shall be established by means of a through bill of lading to be presented to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically. Only in those situations where it clearly would be impossible to ship merchandise on a through bill of lading (e.g., shipments via the seller's own conveyance) will other documentation satisfactory to the Center director showing a sale for export to the United States and placement for through shipment to the United States be accepted in lieu of a through bill of lading.
