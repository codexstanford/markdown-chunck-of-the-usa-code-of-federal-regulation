(2)FIFO inventory procedures may be used only for fungible merchandise. For purposes of this section, "fungible merchandise" means merchandise which is identical and interchangeable for all commercial purposes. While commercial interchangeability is usually decided between buyer and seller or between proprietor and importer, CBP is the final arbiter of fungibility in bonded warehouses. The criteria for determining whether merchandise is fungible include, but are not limited to, Governmental and recognized industrial standards, part numbers, tariff classification, value, brand name, unit of quantity (such as barrels, gallons, pounds, pieces), model number, style and same kind and quality. Fungible textile and textile products which are withdrawn from a Class 9 warehouse may be accounted for using FIFO inventory procedures, inasmuch as such articles would be exempt from textile quotas.
