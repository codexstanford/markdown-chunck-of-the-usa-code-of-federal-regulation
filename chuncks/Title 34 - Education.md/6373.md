(ii) For a withdrawal of owner's equity described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section-

(A) For a capital distribution that is the equivalent of wages in a sole proprietorship or partnership, no later than 10 days after the date the Secretary notifies the institution that its composite score is less than 1.5.

However, if the institution makes wage-equivalent distributions that exceed 150 percent of the total amount of wage-equivalent distributions it made during its prior fiscal year less any distributions that were made to pay any taxes related to the operation of the institution at any time during the 18-month period, it must report each of those distributions no later than 10 days after they are made, and the Secretary recalculates the institution's composite score based on the cumulative amount of the distributions made at that time;
