###### § 607.10 What activities may and may not be carried out under a grant?
####### Endowment funds.

(d)If a grantee uses part of its grant funds to establish or increase an endowment fund under paragraphs (b)(11) or (b)(13)(xiii) of this section, it must comply with the provisions of §§ 628.3, 628.6, 628.10 and 628.41 through 628.47 of this chapter with regard to the use of those funds, except-

(1) The definition of the term "endowment fund income" in § 628.6 of this chapter does not apply. For the purposes of this paragraph (d), "endowment fund income" means an amount equal to the total value of the fund, including fund appreciation and retained interest and dividends, minus the endowment fund corpus.

(2) Instead of the requirement in § 628.10(a) of this chapter, the grantee institution must match each dollar of Federal grant funds used to establish or increase an endowment fund with one dollar of non-Federal funds; and

(3) Instead of the requirements in § 628.41(a)(3) through (a)(5) and the introductory text in § 628.41(b) and § 628.41(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this chapter, if a grantee institution decides to use any of its grant funds for endowment purposes, it must match those grant funds immediately with non-Federal funds when it places those funds into its endowment fund.
