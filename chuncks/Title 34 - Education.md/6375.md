####### Audit opinions and disclosures.

(h)Even if an institution satisfies all of the general standards of financial responsibility under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary does not consider the institution to be financially responsible if, in the institution's audited financial statements, the opinion expressed by the auditor was an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion, or the financial statements contain a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements that there is substantial doubt about the institution's ability to continue as a going concern as required by accounting standards, unless the Secretary determines that a qualified or disclaimed opinion does not have a significant bearing on the institution's financial condition, or that the substantial doubt about the institution's ability to continue as going concern has been alleviated.
