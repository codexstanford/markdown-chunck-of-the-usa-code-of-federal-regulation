###### § 600.31 Change in ownership resulting in a change in control for private nonprofit, private for-profit and public institutions.

(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public institution that undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in control ceases to qualify as an eligible institution upon the change in ownership and control. A change of ownership that results in a change in control includes any change by which a person who has or thereby acquires an ownership interest in the entity that owns the institution or the parent of that entity, acquires or loses the ability to control the institution.

(2) If a private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public institution has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change in control, the Secretary may, under the provisions of § 600.20(g) and (h), continue the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs on a provisional basis, provided that the institution submits, under the provisions of § 600.20(g), a materially complete application-

(i) No later than 10 business days after the change occurs; or

(ii) For an institution owned by a publicly-traded corporation, no later than 10 business days after the institution knew, or should have known of the change based upon SEC filings, that the change occurred.

(3) In order to reestablish eligibility and to resume participation in the title IV, HEA programs, the institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that after the change in ownership and control-

(i) The institution satisfies all the applicable requirements contained in §§ 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6, except that if the institution is a proprietary institution of higher education or postsecondary vocational institution, it need not have been in existence for two years before seeking eligibility; and

(ii) The institution qualifies to be certified to participate under 34 CFR part 668, subpart B.
