###### § 682.208 Due diligence in servicing a loan.

(a) The loan servicing process includes reporting to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, responding to borrower inquiries, establishing the terms of repayment, and reporting a borrower's enrollment and loan status information.

(b)(1) An eligible lender of a FFEL loan shall report to each nationwide consumer reporting agency-

(i) The total amount of FFEL loans the lender has made to the borrower, within 90 days of each disbursement;

(ii) The outstanding balance of the loans;

(iii) Information concerning the repayment status of the loan, no less frequently than every 90 days or quarterly after a change in that status from current to delinquent;

(iv) The date the loan is fully repaid by, or on behalf of, the borrower, or discharged by reason of the borrower's death, bankruptcy, or total and permanent disability, within 90 days after that date;

(v) Other information required by law to be reported.

(2) An eligible lender that has acquired a FFEL loan shall report to each nationwide consumer reporting agency the information required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)-(v) of this section within 90 days of its acquisition of the loan.

(3) Upon receipt of a valid identity theft report as defined in section 603(q)(4) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a) or notification from a consumer reporting agency that information furnished by the lender is a result of an alleged identity theft as defined in § 682.402(e)(14), an eligible lender shall suspend consumer reporting agency reporting for a period not to exceed 120 days while the lender determines the enforceability of a loan.

(i) If the lender determines that a loan does not qualify for a discharge under § 682.402(e)(1)(i)(C), but is nonetheless unenforceable, the lender must-

(A) Notify the consumer reporting agency of its determination; and

(B) Comply with §§ 682.300(b)(2)(ix) and 682.302(d)(1)(viii).

(ii) [Reserved]

(4) If, within 3 years of the lender's receipt of an identity theft report, the lender receives from the borrower evidence specified in § 682.402(e)(3)(v), the lender may submit a claim and receive interest subsidy and special allowance payments that would have accrued on the loan.

(c)(1) A lender shall respond within 30 days after receipt to any inquiry from a borrower or any endorser on a loan.

(2) When a lender learns that a Stafford loan borrower or a student PLUS loan borrower is no longer enrolled at an institution of higher education on at least a half-time basis, the lender shall promptly contact the borrower in order to establish the terms of repayment.

(3)(i) If the borrower disputes the terms of the loan in writing and the lender does not resolve the dispute, the lender's response must provide the borrower with an appropriate contact at the guaranty agency for the resolution of the dispute.

(ii) If the guaranty agency does not resolve the dispute, the agency's response must provide the borrower with information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.

(d) Subject to the rules regarding maximum duration of a repayment period and minimum annual payment described in § 682.209(a)(7), (c), and (h), nothing in this part is intended to limit a lender's discretion in establishing, or, with the borrower's consent, revising a borrower's repayment schedule-

(1) To provide for graduated or income-sensitive repayment terms. The Secretary strongly encourages lenders to provide a graduated or income-sensitive repayment schedule to a borrower providing for at least the payment of interest charges, unless the borrower requests otherwise, in order to make the borrower's repayment burden commensurate with his or her projected ability to pay; or

(2) To provide a single repayment schedule, as authorized and if practicable, for all FFEL program loans to the borrower held by the lender.

(e)(1) If the assignment or transfer of ownership interest of a Stafford, PLUS, SLS, or Consolidation loan is to result in a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower must send subsequent payments, the assignor and assignee of the loan shall, no later than 45 days from the date the assignee acquires a legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the assigned loan, provide, either jointly or separately, a notice to the borrower of-

(i) The assignment;

(ii) The identity of the assignee;

(iii) The name and address of the party to whom subsequent payments or communications must be sent;

(iv) The telephone numbers of both the assignor and the assignee;

(v) The effective date of the assignment or transfer of the loan;

(vi) The date, if applicable, on which the current loan servicer will stop accepting payments; and

(vii) The date on which the new loan servicer will begin accepting payments.

(2) If the assignor and assignee separately provide the notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, each notice must indicate that a corresponding notice will be sent by the other party to the assignment.

(3) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "assigned" is defined in § 682.401(b)(8)(ii).

(4) The assignee, or the assignor on behalf of the assignee, shall notify the guaranty agency that guaranteed the loan within 45 days of the date the assignee acquires a legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the loan of-

(i) The assignment; and

(ii) The name and address of the assignee, and the telephone number of the assignee that can be used to obtain information about the repayment of the loan.

(5) The requirements of this paragraph (e), as to borrower notification, apply if the borrower is in a grace period or has entered the repayment period.

(f)(1) Notwithstanding an error by the school or lender, a lender shall follow the procedures in § 682.412 whenever it receives information that can be substantiated that the borrower, or the student on whose behalf a parent has borrowed, has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program assistance, provided false or erroneous information or took actions that caused the student or borrower-

(i) To be ineligible for all or a portion of a loan made under this part;

(ii) To receive a Stafford loan subject to payment of Federal interest benefits as provided under § 682.301, for which he or she was ineligible; or

(iii) To receive loan proceeds that were not paid to the school or repaid to the lender by or on behalf of a registered student who-

(B) Failed to attend school during that period.

(2) For purposes of this section, the term "guaranty agency" in § 682.412(e) refers to the Secretary in the case of a Federal GSL loan.
