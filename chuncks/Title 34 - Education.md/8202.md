(xi) Provide information on the National Student Loan Data System and how the borrower can access the borrower's records;

(xii) Provide the name of and contact information for the individual the borrower may contact if the borrower has any questions about the borrower's rights and responsibilities or the terms and conditions of the loan;

(xiii) For loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020, if, as a condition of enrollment, the school requires borrowers to enter into a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, as defined in § 668.41(h)(2)(iii) of this chapter, or to sign a class action waiver, as defined in § 668.41(h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this chapter, the school must provide a written description of the school's dispute resolution process that the borrower has agreed to pursue, including the name and contact information for the individual or office at the school that the borrower may contact if the borrower has a dispute relating to the borrower's loans or to the provision of educational services for which the loans were provided;

(xv) For loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020, if, as a condition of enrollment, the school requires borrowers to sign a class-action waiver, as defined in § 668.41(h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this chapter, the school must explain how and when the waiver applies, alternative processes the borrower may pursue to seek redress, and who to contact if the borrower has any questions.

(7) Entrance counseling for graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must-

(i) Inform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on-

(A) A range of student levels or indebtedness of graduate or professional student PLUS loan borrowers, of student borrowers with Direct PLUS Loans and Direct Subsidized Loans or Direct Unsubsidized Loans, depending on the types of loans the borrower has obtained; or

(8) A school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as part of the school's quality assurance plan described in § 685.300(b)(9). If a school adopts an alternative approach, it is not required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section unless the Secretary determines that the alternative approach is not adequate for the school. The alternative approach must-

(i) Ensure that each student borrower subject to entrance counseling under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is provided written counseling materials that contain the information described in paragraphs (a)(6)(i) through (a)(6)(v) of this section;

(ii) Be designed to target those student borrowers who are most likely to default on their repayment obligations and provide them more intensive counseling and support services; and

(iii) Include performance measures that demonstrate the effectiveness of the school's alternative approach. These performance measures must include objective outcomes, such as levels of borrowing, default rates, and withdrawal rates.

(9) The school must maintain documentation substantiating the school's compliance with this section for each student borrower.
