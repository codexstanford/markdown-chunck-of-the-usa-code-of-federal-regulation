###### ยง 222.71 What tax rates may the Secretary use if substantial local revenues are derived from local tax sources other than real property taxes?

(a) In a State in which a substantial portion of revenues for current expenditures for educational purposes is derived from local tax sources other than real property taxes, the State educational agency (SEA) may request that the Secretary take those revenues into account in determining whether an LEA in that State meets the applicable tax rate requirement under ยง 222.68.

(b) If, based upon the request of an SEA, the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to take the revenues described in paragraph (a) of this section into account in determining whether an LEA in that State meets the applicable tax rate requirement under ยง 222.68, the Secretary uses tax rates computed by-

(1) Dividing the assessed value of each classification of real property in the LEA by the percentage of true value assigned to that property for tax purposes and aggregating the results;

(2) Determining the LEA's total revenues derived from local tax sources for current expenditures (as defined in section 8013);

(3) Dividing the amount determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the amount determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

(4) Performing the computations in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for each of the generally comparable LEAs and then determining the average of those computed tax rates.
