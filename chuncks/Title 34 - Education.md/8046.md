####### Borrower qualification for discharge.

(c)(1) For loans first disbursed before July 1, 2020, in order to qualify for discharge of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit to the Secretary a written request and sworn statement, and the factual assertions in the statement must be true. The statement need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the borrower must-

(i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)-

(A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;

(B) Did not complete the program of study at that school because the school closed while the student was enrolled, or the student withdrew from the school not more than 120 days before the school closed. The Secretary may extend the 120-day period if the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances related to a school's closing justify an extension. Exceptional circumstances for this purpose may include, but are not limited to: the school's loss of accreditation; the school's discontinuation of the majority of its academic programs; action by the State to revoke the school's license to operate or award academic credentials in the State; or a finding by a State or Federal government agency that the school violated State or Federal law; and

(C) Did not complete the program of study through a teach-out at another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school;

(ii) State whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the borrower's loan obligation; and

(iii) State that the borrower (or student)-

(A) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this section; and

(B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) For loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020, in order to qualify for discharge of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit to the Secretary a completed application, and the factual assertions in the application must be true and made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. The application explains the procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge and requires the borrower to-

(i) Certify that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)-

(A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after July 1, 2020 to attend a school;

(B) Did not complete the program of study at that school because the school closed on the date that the student was enrolled, or the student withdrew from the school not more than 180 calendar days before the date that the school closed. The Secretary may extend the 180-day period if the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances related to a school's closing justify an extension. Exceptional circumstances for this purpose may include, but are not limited to: The revocation or withdrawal by an accrediting agency of the school's institutional accreditation; revocation or withdrawal by the State authorization or licensing authority to operate or to award academic credentials in the State; the termination by the Department of the school's participation in a title IV, HEA program; the teach-out of the student's educational program exceeds the 180-day look-back period for a closed school loan discharge; or the school responsible for the teach-out of the student's educational program fails to perform the material terms of the teach-out plan or agreement, such that the student does not have a reasonable opportunity to complete his or her program of study or a comparable program; and

(C) Did not complete the program of study or a comparable program through a teach-out at another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school;

(ii) Certify that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf the parent borrowed) has not accepted the opportunity to complete, or is not continuing in, the program of study or a comparable program through either an institutional teach-out plan performed by the school or a teach-out agreement at another school, approved by the school's accrediting agency and, if applicable, the school's State authorizing agency.

(3) If the Secretary determines, based on information in the Secretary's possession, that the borrower qualifies for the discharge of a loan under this section, the Secretary-

(i) May discharge the loan without an application from the borrower; and

(ii) With respect to schools that closed on or after November 1, 2013, and before July 1, 2020, will discharge the loan without an application from the borrower if the borrower did not subsequently re-enroll in any title IV-eligible institution within a period of three years from the date the school closed.
