###### ยง 600.58 Duration of eligibility determination.

(a) The eligibility of a foreign institution under this subpart expires six years after the date of the Secretary's determination that the institution is eligible to apply for participation, except that the Secretary may specify a shorter period of eligibility. In the case of a foreign graduate medical school, continued eligibility is dependent upon annual submission of the data and information required under ยง 600.55(a)(5)(i), subject to the terms described in ยง 600.53(b).

(b) A foreign institution that has been determined eligible loses its eligibility on the date that the institution no longer meets any of the criteria in this subpart E.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of 34 CFR 668.26, if a foreign institution loses its eligibility under this subpart E, an otherwise eligible student, continuously enrolled at the institution before the loss of eligibility, may receive an FFEL program loan for attendance at that institution for the academic year succeeding the academic year in which that institution lost its eligibility, if the student actually received an FFEL program loan for attendance at the institution for a period during which the institution was eligible under this subpart E.
