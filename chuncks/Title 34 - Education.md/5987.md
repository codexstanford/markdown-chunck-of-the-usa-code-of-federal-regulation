####### Repayments.

(g)(1) An institution or third-party servicer that must repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification, unless-

(i) The institution or servicer files an appeal under the procedures established in subpart H of this part; or

(ii) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g)(1) of this section-

(i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted surety or has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary questions expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements and identifies liabilities, then the Secretary may determine that deferring recourse to the surety or guarantee is not appropriate because-

(A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers affected by the act or omission giving rise to the liability outweighs the importance of deferring collection action until completion of available appeal proceedings; or

(B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete assurance that recourse to that protection will be fully available through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or

(ii) The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR part 30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures of this section.

(3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in the Secretary's notification, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or third-party servicer must repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this part unless-

(i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or

(ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is appropriate pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

(4) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a violation incurred in servicing any aspect of that institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs and remains responsible for that amount until that amount is repaid in full.
