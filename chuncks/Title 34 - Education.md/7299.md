####### Not-for-Profit Holder Change of Status.

(xii)Within 10 business days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a change that may result in a State or non-profit entity that has been designated an eligible not-for-profit holder, either directly or through an eligible lender trustee, losing that eligibility, the State or non-profit entity must-

(A) Submit details of the change to the Secretary; and

(B) Cease billing for special allowance at the rate established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section for the period from the date of the change that may result in it no longer being eligible for the rate established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to the date of the Secretary's determination that such entity has not lost its eligibility as a result of such change; provided, however, that in the quarter following the Secretary's determination that such eligible not-for-profit holder has not lost its eligibility, the eligible not-for-profit holder may submit a billing for special allowance during the period from the date of the change to the date of the Secretary's determination equal to the difference between special allowance at the rate established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and the amount it actually billed at the rate established under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

(xiii) In the case of a loan for which the special allowance payment is calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and that is sold by the eligible not-for-profit holder holding the loan to an entity that is not an eligible not-for-profit holder, the special allowance payment for such loan shall, beginning on the date of the sale, no longer be calculated under paragraph (f)(2) and shall be calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section instead.

(4) In the case of a loan for which the special allowance payment is calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and that is sold by the eligible not-for-profit holder holding the loan to an entity that is not an eligible not-for-profit holder, the special allowance payment for such loan shall, beginning on the date of the sale, no longer be calculated under paragraph (f)(2) and shall be calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section instead.

(g) For purposes of this section-

(1) A tax-exempt obligation is an obligation the income of which is exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C.);

(2) The date on which an obligation is considered to be "originally issued" is determined under § 682.302(f)(2)(i) or (ii), as applicable.

(i) An obligation issued to obtain funds to make loans, or to purchase a legal or equitable interest in loans, including by pledge as collateral for that obligation, is considered to be originally issued on the date issued.

(ii) A tax-exempt obligation that refunds, or is one of a series of tax-exempt refundings with respect to a tax-exempt obligation described in § 682.302(f)(2)(i), is considered to be originally issued on the date on which the obligation described in § 682.302(f)(2)(i) was issued.

(3) A loan is refinanced when an Authority that has pledged the loan as collateral for an obligation of that Authority retains an interest in the loan, but causes the loan to be released from the lien of that obligation and pledged as collateral for a different obligation of that Authority.

(4) References to an Authority include a successor entity that may not qualify as an Authority under § 682.200(b).
