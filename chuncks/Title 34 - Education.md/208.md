###### School Outdoor Education

means a separate facility for outdoor education as distinguished from components of a basic school. Components of a school such as playgrounds and athletic fields receive the basic allowance applicable for that type of school. The outdoor education must be located reasonably near the school system and may be open to and used by the general public, but only if the educational program for which the property is conveyed is given priority of use. This category does not include components of the school such as playgrounds and athletic fields, that are utilized during the normal school year, and are available to all students.
