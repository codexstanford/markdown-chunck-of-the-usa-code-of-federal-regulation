###### ยง 463.190 When are sanctions applied for failure to achieve adjusted levels of performance?

(a) States' negotiated levels of performance will be adjusted through the application of the statistical adjustment model established under ยง 463.170 to account for actual economic conditions experienced during a program year and characteristics of participants, annually at the close of each program year.

(b) Any State that fails to meet adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance outlined in ยง 463.155 for any year will receive technical assistance, including assistance in the development of a performance improvement plan provided by the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education.

(c) Whether a State has failed to meet adjusted levels of performance will be determined using the following three criteria:

(1) The overall State program score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by a core program on the primary indicators of performance to the adjusted levels of performance for that core program. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators by a core program will constitute the overall State program score.

(2) However, until all indicators for the core program have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State program score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data for that program;

(3) The overall State indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved on a primary indicator of performance by all core programs in a State to the adjusted levels of performance for that primary indicator. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance by all of the core programs on that indicator will constitute the overall State indicator score.

(4) However, until all indicators for the State have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State indicator score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data in a State.

(5) The individual indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by each core program on each of the individual primary indicators to the adjusted levels of performance for each of the program's primary indicators of performance.

(d) A performance failure occurs when:

(1) Any overall State program score or overall State indicator score falls below 90 percent for the program year; or

(2) Any of the States' individual indicator scores fall below 50 percent for the program year.

(e) Sanctions based on performance failure will be applied to States if, for 2 consecutive years, the State fails to meet:

(1) 90 percent of the overall State program score for the same core program;

(2) 90 percent of the overall State indicator score for the same primary indicator; or

(3) 50 percent of the same indicator score for the same program.
