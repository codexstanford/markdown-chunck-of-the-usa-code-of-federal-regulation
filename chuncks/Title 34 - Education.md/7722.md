###### 1. Cures.

In the case of a loan involving violations described in section I.C.2.d. or I.C.3.d., the lender may utilize either of the two procedures described in section I.D.1.a or I.D.1.b. for obtaining reinstatement of reinsurance coverage on the loan.

a. After the violations occur, the lender obtains a new repayment agreement signed by the borrower. The repayment agreement must comply with the repayment period limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(8) and 682.209(h)(2); or

b. After the violations occur, the lender obtains one full payment. If the borrower later defaults, the guaranty agency must obtain evidence of this payment (e.g., a copy of the check) from the lender.
