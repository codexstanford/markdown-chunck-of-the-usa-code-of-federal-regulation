####### Exception to disclosure requirement.

(b)In the case of a Federal Unsubsidized Stafford loan or a Federal PLUS loan, the lender is not required to provide the information in paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section if the lender, instead of that disclosure, provides the borrower with sample projections of the monthly repayment amounts assuming different levels of borrowing and interest accruals resulting from capitalization of interest while the borrower or student on whose behalf the loan is made is in school. Sample projections must disclose the cost to the borrower of principal and interest, interest only, and capitalized interest. The lender may rely on the Stafford and PLUS promissory notes and associated materials approved by the Secretary for purposes of complying with this section.
