###### § 686.32 Counseling requirements.
####### Subsequent counseling.

(b)(1) If a student receives more than one TEACH Grant, the institution must ensure that the student receives additional counseling prior to the first disbursement of each subsequent TEACH Grant award.

(2) Subsequent counseling may be in person, by audiovisual presentation, or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the institution must ensure that an individual with expertise in title IV, HEA programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student's questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student enrolled in a correspondence program of study or a study-abroad program of study approved for credit at the home institution, the student may be provided with written counseling materials before the grant is disbursed.

(3) Subsequent counseling must-

(i) Review the terms and conditions of the TEACH Grant agreement to serve or repay as described in § 686.12;

(ii) Emphasize to the grant recipient that if the grant recipient fails or refuses to complete the service obligation contained in the agreement to serve or repay or any other condition of the agreement to serve or repay-

(A) The TEACH Grant must be repaid as a Direct Unsubsidized Loan; and

(B) The grant recipient will be obligated to repay the full amount of the grant and the accrued interest from the disbursement date;

(iii) Explain the circumstances, as described in § 686.43, under which a TEACH Grant will be converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan;

(iv) Explain that to avoid further accrual of interest as described in § 686.12(b)(4)(ii), a grant recipient who decides not to teach in a qualified school or field, or who for any other reason no longer intends to satisfy the service obligation, may request that the Secretary convert his or her TEACH Grant to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan that the grant recipient may begin repaying immediately, instead of waiting for the TEACH Grant to be converted to a loan under the condition described in § 686.43(a)(1)(ii);

(v) Emphasize that, once a TEACH Grant is converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it may be reconverted to a grant only if-

(A) The Secretary determines, based on documentation provided by the recipient or in the Secretary's records, that the grant recipient was satisfying the service obligation as described in § 686.12 or that the grant was converted to a loan in error; or

(B) In the case of a grant recipient whose TEACH Grant was converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in accordance with § 686.43(a)(1)(i), the grant recipient requests that the Secretary reconvert the loan to a grant and is determined to be eligible for reconversion in accordance with § 686.43(a)(8); and

(vi) Review for the grant recipient information on the availability of the Department's Federal Student Aid Ombudsman's office.
