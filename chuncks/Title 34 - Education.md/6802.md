####### Secretary's review of the total and permanent disability discharge application.

(3)(i) If, after reviewing the veteran's completed application, the Secretary determines, based on a review of the documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs, that the veteran is totally and permanently disabled as defined in § 674.51(aa)(2), the Secretary notifies the veteran and the veteran's lenders that the application for disability discharge has been approved. With this notification, the Secretary provides the effective date of the determination and directs each institution holding a Direct, NDSL, or Perkins Loan made to the veteran to discharge the loan.

(ii) The institution returns any payments received on or after the effective date of the determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the veteran is unemployable due to a service-connected disability to the person who made the payments.

(iii) If the Secretary determines, based on a review of the documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs, that the veteran is not totally and permanently disabled as defined in § 674.51(aa)(2), the Secretary notifies the veteran or the veteran's representative, and the institution that the application for a disability discharge has been denied. The notification includes-

(A) The reason or reasons for the denial;

(B) An explanation that the loan is due and payable to the institution under the terms of the promissory note and that the loan will return to the status that would have existed had the total and permanent disability discharge application not been received;

(C) An explanation that the institution will notify the veteran of the date the veteran must resume making payments on the loan;

(D) An explanation that the veteran is not required to submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application if the veteran requests that the Secretary re-evaluate the veteran's application for discharge by providing, within 12 months of the date of the notification, additional documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs that supports the veteran's eligibility for discharge; and

(E) Information on how the veteran may reapply for a total and permanent disability discharge in accordance with the procedures described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section, if the documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs does not indicate that the veteran is totally and permanently disabled as defined in § 674.51(aa)(2), but indicates that the veteran may be totally and permanently disabled as defined in § 674.51(aa)(1).
