(b)(1) A holder of a HEAL loan must treat a refund payment received from a HEAL school as a downward adjustment in the principal amount of the loan.

(2) When a lender receives a school refund check for a loan it no longer holds, the lender must transfer that payment to the holder of the loan and either inform the borrower about the refund check and where it was sent or, if the borrower's address is unknown, notify the current holder that the borrower was not informed. The current holder must provide the borrower with a written notice of the refund payment.
