###### ยง 690.80 Recalculation of a Federal Pell Grant award.
####### Change in expected family contribution.

(a)(1) The institution shall recalculate a Federal Pell Grant award for the entire award year if the student's expected family contribution changes at any time during the award year. The change may result from-

(i) The correction of a clerical or arithmetic error under ยง 690.14; or

(ii) A correction based on information required as a result of verification under 34 CFR part 668, subpart E.

(2) Except as described in 34 CFR 668.60(c), the institution shall adjust the student's award when an overaward or underaward is caused by the change in the expected family contribution. That adjustment must be made-

(i) Within the same award year-if possible-to correct any overpayment or underpayment; or

(ii) During the next award year to correct any overpayment that could not be adjusted during the year in which the student was overpaid.
