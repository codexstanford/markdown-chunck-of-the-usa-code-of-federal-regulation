(iii) If the borrower fails to submit an application for a total and permanent disability discharge to the Secretary within 120 days, collection resumes on the borrower's title IV loans, and the lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance of principal and interest from the date it suspended collection activity.

The holders of the loans must notify the applicable guaranty agencies that the total and permanent disability discharge application has been received.

(vii) If the application is incomplete, the Secretary notifies the borrower of the missing information and requests the missing information from the borrower or the physician who provided the certification, as appropriate. The Secretary does not make a determination of eligibility until the application is complete.
