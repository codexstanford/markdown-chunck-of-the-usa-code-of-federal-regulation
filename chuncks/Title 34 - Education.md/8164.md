The Secretary also recalculates the monthly payment for a borrower who chooses to stop making income-based payments. In either case, as result of the recalculation-

(i) The maximum monthly amount that the Secretary requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's eligible loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment on the loans under the income-based repayment plan; and

(ii) The borrower's repayment period based on the recalculated payment amount may exceed 10 years.

(2)(i) If a borrower no longer wishes to pay under the income-based repayment plan, the borrower must pay under the standard repayment plan and the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment based on-

(A) For a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan, the time remaining under the maximum ten-year repayment period for the amount of the borrower's loans that were outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan; or

(B) For a Direct Consolidation Loan, the time remaining under the applicable repayment period as initially determined under ยง 685.208(j) and the amount of that loan that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan.

(ii) A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan and who is required to repay under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may request a change to a different repayment plan after making one monthly payment under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan. For this purpose, a monthly payment may include one payment made under a forbearance that provides for accepting smaller payments than previously scheduled, in accordance with ยง 685.205(a).
