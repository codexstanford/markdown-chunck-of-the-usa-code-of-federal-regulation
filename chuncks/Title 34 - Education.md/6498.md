###### ยง 668.204 Draft cohort default rates and your ability to challenge before official cohort default rates are issued.
####### General.

(a)(1) We notify you of your draft cohort default rate before your official cohort default rate is calculated. Our notice includes the loan record detail report for the draft cohort default rate.

(2) Regardless of the number of borrowers included in your cohort, your draft cohort default rate is always calculated using data for that fiscal year alone, using the method described in ยง 668.202(d)(1).

(3) Your draft cohort default rate and the loan record detail report are not considered public information and may not be otherwise voluntarily released to the public by a data manager.

(4) Any challenge you submit under this section and any response provided by a data manager must be in a format acceptable to us. This acceptable format is described in the "Cohort Default Rate Guide" that we provide to you. If your challenge does not comply with the requirements in the "Cohort Default Rate Guide," we may deny your challenge.
