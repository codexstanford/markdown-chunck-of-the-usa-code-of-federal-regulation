(a) Before the Secretary sets the amount of a new grant, the Secretary does a cost analysis of the project. The Secretary:

(1) Verifies the cost data in the detailed budget for the project;

(2) Evaluates specific elements of costs; and

(3) Examines costs to determine if they are necessary, reasonable, and allowable under applicable statutes and regulations.

(b) The Secretary uses the cost analysis as a basis for determining the amount of the grant to the applicant. The cost analysis shows whether the applicant can achieve the objectives of the project with reasonable efficiency and economy under the budget in the application.
