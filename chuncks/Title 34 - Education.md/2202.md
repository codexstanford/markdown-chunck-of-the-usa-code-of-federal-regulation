1.

(a) The determinations of disparity in current expenditures or revenue per pupil are made by-

(i) Ranking all LEAs having similar grade levels within the State on the basis of current expenditures or revenue per pupil for the second preceding fiscal year before the year of determination;

(ii) Identifying those LEAs in each ranking that fall at the 95th and 5th percentiles of the total number of pupils in attendance in the schools of those LEAs; and

(iii) Subtracting the lower current expenditure or revenue per pupil figure from the higher for those agencies identified in paragraph (ii) and dividing the difference by the lower figure.

(b) In cases under ยง 222.162(b), where separate computations are made for different groups of LEAs, the disparity percentage for each group is obtained in the manner described in paragraph (a) above. Then the weighted average disparity percentage for the State as a whole is determined by-

(i) Multiplying the disparity percentage for each group by the total number of pupils receiving free public education in the schools in that group;

(ii) Summing the figures obtained in paragraph (b)(i); and

(iii) Dividing the sum obtained in paragraph (b)(ii) by the total number of pupils for all the groups.
