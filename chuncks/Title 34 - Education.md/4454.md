####### Post-test.

(c)A local eligible provider must-

(2) Administer the post-test to students at a uniform time, according to the State's assessment policy;

(3)(i) Administer post-tests with a secure, parallel, equated form of the same test-either traditional paper and pencil or computer-administered instruments-for which forms are constructed prior to administration to examinees to pre-test and determine the initial placement of students; or

(ii) Administer post-tests with an adaptive test that uses computerized algorithms for selecting and administering items in real time; however, for such an instrument, the size of the item pool and the method of item selection must ensure negligible overlap in items across pre- and post-testing; and

(4) Administer post-tests to students in the same skill areas as the pre-test.
