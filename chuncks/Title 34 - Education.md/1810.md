######## Assessing English language proficiency of English learners.

(h)(1) Each State must-

(i) Develop a uniform, valid, and reliable statewide assessment of English language proficiency, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills; and

(ii) Require each LEA to use such assessment to assess annually the English language proficiency, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, of all English learners in kindergarten through grade 12 in schools served by the LEA.

(2) The assessment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section must-

(i) Be aligned with the State's English language proficiency standards under section 1111(b)(1)(F) of the Act;

(ii) Be developed and used consistent with the requirements of ยง 200.2(b)(2), (4), and (5); and

(iii) Provide coherent and timely information about each student's attainment of the State's English language proficiency standards to parents consistent with ยง 200.2(e) and section 1112(e)(3) of the Act.

(3) If a State develops a computer-adaptive assessment to measure English language proficiency, the State must ensure that the computer-adaptive assessment-

(i) Assesses a student's language proficiency, which may include growth toward proficiency, in order to measure the student's acquisition of English; and

(ii) Meets the requirements for English language proficiency assessments in paragraph (h) of this section.

(4)(i) A State must provide appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure a student's English language proficiency relative to the State's English language proficiency standards under section 1111(b)(1)(F) of the Act for each English learner covered under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section.

(ii) If an English learner has a disability that precludes assessment of the student in one or more domains of the English language proficiency assessment required under section 1111(b)(2)(G) of the Act such that there are no appropriate accommodations for the affected domain(s) (e.g., a non-verbal English learner who because of an identified disability cannot take the speaking portion of the assessment), as determined, on an individualized basis, by the student's IEP team, 504 team, or by the individual or team designated by the LEA to make these decisions under title II of the ADA, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a State must assess the student's English language proficiency based on the remaining domains in which it is possible to assess the student.

(5) A State must provide for an alternate English language proficiency assessment for each English learner covered under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section who cannot participate in the assessment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section even with appropriate accommodations.
