###### ยง 222.53 What restrictions and requirements apply to the use of funds provided under section 8003(d)?
####### i.e.

(1) By recording, for each fiscal year, the receipt (or credit) of section 8003(d) funds separately from other funds received under the Act,, on a line item basis in the general fund account or in a separate account; and

(2) By demonstrating that, for each fiscal year, the amount of expenditures for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to the federally connected children with disabilities is at least equal to the amount of section 8003(d) funds received or credited for that fiscal year. This is done as follows:

(i) For each fiscal year determine the amount of an LEA's expenditures for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to all children with disabilities.

(ii) The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is divided by the average daily attendance (ADA) of the total number of children with disabilities the LEA served during that fiscal year.

(iii) The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is then multiplied by the total ADA of the LEA's federally connected children with disabilities claimed by the LEA for that fiscal year.

(3) If the amount of section 8003(d) funds the LEA received (or was credited) for the fiscal year exceeds the amount obtained in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, an overpayment equal to the excess section 8003(d) funds is established. This overpayment may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that the LEA can demonstrate that the average per pupil expenditure for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to federally connected children with disabilities exceeded its average per pupil expenditure for serving non-federally connected children with disabilities.
