#### ยง 33.31 Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the Department head, upon appeal, evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating fraudulent conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty is imposed.
