####### ยง 222.117 What procedures are followed after the Assistant Secretary issues a notice of intent to withhold payments?
######## After an IPP hearing.

(c)(1) An LEA that rejects or fails to implement the final determination of the Assistant Secretary after an IPP hearing has 10 days from the date of the LEA's receipt of the written notice of intent to withhold funds to provide the Assistant Secretary with a written explanation and documentation in support of the reasons why its payments should not be withheld. The Assistant Secretary provides the affected Indian tribe or tribes with an opportunity to respond to the LEA's submission.

(2) If after reviewing an LEA's written explanation and supporting documentation, and any response from the Indian tribe or tribes, the Assistant Secretary determines to withhold an LEA's payments, the Assistant Secretary notifies the LEA and the affected Indian tribe or tribes of the withholding determination in writing by certified mail with return receipt requested prior to withholding the payments.

(3) In the withholding determination, the Assistant Secretary states the facts supporting the determination that the LEA failed to comply with the legal requirements at issue, and why the provisions of ยง 222.120 (provisions governing circumstances when an LEA is exempt from the withholding of payments) are inapplicable. This determination is the final decision of the Department.
