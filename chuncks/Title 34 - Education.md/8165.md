###### § 685.221 Income-based repayment plan.
####### Eligibility documentation, verification, and notifications.

(e)(1) The Secretary determines whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower selects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan. To make this determination, the Secretary requires the borrower to-

(i) Provide documentation, acceptable to the Secretary, of the borrower's AGI;

(ii) If the borrower's AGI is not available, or the Secretary believes that the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, provide other documentation to verify income; and

(iii) Annually certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the Secretary assumes a family size of one for that year.

(2) After making a determination that a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower initially elects the plan and for any subsequent year that the borrower has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with-

(i) The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount, as calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment amount will apply (annual payment period);

(ii) Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the income-based repayment plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the Secretary must receive this information;

(iii) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (e)(7) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information;

(iv) An explanation of the consequences if the borrower no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan; and

(v) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the Secretary recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.

(3) For each subsequent year that a borrower who currently has a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The notification provides the borrower with-

(i) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the Secretary must receive all of the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (annual deadline); and

(ii) The consequences if the Secretary does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount, and the fact that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized at the end of the borrower's current annual payment period in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(4) Each time the Secretary makes a determination that a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship for a subsequent year that the borrower wishes to remain on the plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with-

(i) The borrower's recalculated monthly payment amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

(ii) An explanation that unpaid interest will be capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

(iii) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time, that the Secretary redetermine whether the borrower has a partial financial hardship, if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount used to determine that the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship does not reflect the borrower's current income, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified annually of this option. If the Secretary determines that the borrower again has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.

(5) For each subsequent year that a borrower who does not currently have a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.

(6) If a borrower who is currently repaying under another repayment plan selects the income-based repayment plan but does not provide the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section, or if the Secretary determines that the borrower does not have a partial financial hardship, the borrower remains on his or her current repayment plan.

(7) The Secretary designates the repayment option described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if a borrower who is currently repaying under the income-based repayment plan remains on the plan for a subsequent year but the Secretary does not receive the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(ii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, unless the Secretary is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period.

(8) If the Secretary receives the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline-

(i) The Secretary promptly determines the borrower's new scheduled monthly payment amount and maintains the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the new scheduled monthly payment amount is determined.

(A) If the new monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary makes the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account. Notwithstanding the requirements of § 685.211(a)(3), unless the borrower requests otherwise, the Secretary applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(B) If the new monthly payment amount is equal to or greater than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary does not make any adjustment to the borrower's account.

(C) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).

(ii) The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.

(9)(i) If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline and the borrower's monthly payment amount is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Secretary grants forbearance with respect to payments that are overdue or would be due at the time the new calculated income-based monthly payment amount is determined, if the new monthly payment amount is $0.00 or is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount. Interest that accrues during the portion of this forbearance period that covers payments that are overdue after the end of the prior annual payment period is not capitalized.

(ii) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).
