###### ยง 363.1 What is the State Supported Employment Services program?

(a) Under the State supported employment services program, the Secretary provides grants to assist States in developing and implementing collaborative programs with appropriate entities to provide programs of supported employment services for individuals with the most significant disabilities, including youth with the most significant disabilities, to enable them to achieve an employment outcome of supported employment in competitive integrated employment. Grants made under the State supported employment services program supplement a State's vocational rehabilitation program grants under 34 CFR part 361.

(b) For purposes of this part and 34 CFR part 361, "supported employment" means competitive integrated employment, including customized employment, or employment in an integrated work setting in which an individual with a most significant disability, including a youth with a most significant disability, is working on a short-term basis toward competitive integrated employment, that is individualized and customized, consistent with the unique strengths, abilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual, including with ongoing support services for individuals with the most significant disabilities-

(1)(i) For whom competitive integrated employment has not historically occurred; or

(ii) For whom competitive integrated employment has been interrupted or intermittent as a result of a significant disability; and

(2) Who, because of the nature and severity of the disability, need intensive supported employment services, and extended services after the transition from support provided by the designated State unit in order to perform the work.
