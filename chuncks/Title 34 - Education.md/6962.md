###### ยง 681.32 The HEAL lender or holder insurance contract.
####### Comprehensive insurance contract.

(c)(1)A lender with a comprehensive insurance contract may disburse a loan without submitting an individual borrower's loan application to the Secretary for approval. All eligible loans made by a lender with this type of contract are insured immediately upon disbursement.

(2) The Secretary will revoke the comprehensive contract of any lender who utilizes procedures which are inconsistent with the HEAL statute and regulations, the lender's insurance contract, or its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to ยง 681.31(c), and require that such lenders disburse HEAL loans only under a standard contract. When the Secretary determines that the lender is in compliance with the HEAL statute and regulations and its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to ยง 681.31(c), the lender may reapply for a comprehensive contract.

(3) In providing comprehensive contracts, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible lenders that:

(i) Make loans to students at interest rates below the rates prevailing during the period involved; or

(ii) Make loans under terms that are otherwise favorable to the student relative to the terms under which eligible lenders are generally making loans during the period involved.
