###### § 685.202 Charges for which Direct Loan Program borrowers are responsible.
####### Capitalization.

(b)(1) The Secretary may add unpaid accrued interest to the borrower's unpaid principal balance. This increase in the principal balance of a loan is called "capitalization."

(2) For a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan that qualifies for a grace period under the regulations that were in effect for consolidation applications received before July 1, 2006, a Direct PLUS Loan, or for a Direct Subsidized Loan for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2014, the Secretary may capitalize the unpaid interest that accrues on the loan when the borrower enters repayment.

(3) Notwithstanding § 685.208(l)(5) and § 685.209(b)(3)(iv), for a Direct Loan not eligible for interest subsidies during periods of deferment, and for all Direct Loans during periods of forbearance, the Secretary capitalizes the unpaid interest that has accrued on the loan upon the expiration of the deferment or forbearance.

(4) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and in §§ 685.208(l)(5) and 685.209(b)(3)(iv), the Secretary annually capitalizes unpaid interest when the borrower is paying under the alternative repayment plan or the income-contingent repayment plan described in § 685.209(b) and the borrower's scheduled payments do not cover the interest that has accrued on the loan.

(5) The Secretary may capitalize unpaid interest when the borrower defaults on the loan.
