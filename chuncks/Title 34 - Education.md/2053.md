####### Basis for foundation payment.

(c)(1) The foundation payment for a consolidated district is based on the total section 7002 payment for the last fiscal year for which the former LEA received payment. When more than one former LEA qualifies under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the payments for the last fiscal year for which the former LEAs received payment are added together to calculate the foundation basis.

(2) Consolidated LEAs receive only a foundation payment and do not receive a payment from any remaining funds.
