(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each ED award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces-

(1) To the ED official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by ED officials or their designated representatives.
