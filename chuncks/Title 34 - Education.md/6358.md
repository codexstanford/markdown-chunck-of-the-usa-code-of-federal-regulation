(k)If an institution did not make a disbursement to an enrolled student for a payment period the student completed (for example, because of an administrative delay or because the student's ISIR was not available until a subsequent payment period), the institution may pay the student for all prior payment periods in the current award year or loan period for which the student was eligible. For Pell Grant payments under this paragraph (k), the student's enrollment status must be determined according to work already completed, as required by 34 CFR 690.76(b).
