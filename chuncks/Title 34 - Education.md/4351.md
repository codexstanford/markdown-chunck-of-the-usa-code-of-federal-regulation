####### Provided,

(e) The operation of a vending facility established under pre-existing arrangements shall not be affected by the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section shall further not preclude future arrangements under which vending facilities to be operated by blind vendors may be established in buildings of a size or with an employee population less than that specified in paragraph (d) of this section:That both the State licensing agency and the Federal property managing department, agency or instrumentality concur in such establishment.

(f) Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States, when leasing property in privately owned buildings, shall make every effort to lease property capable of accommodating a vending facility.
