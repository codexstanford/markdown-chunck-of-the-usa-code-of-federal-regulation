###### ยง 600.11 Special rules regarding institutional accreditation or preaccreditation.
####### Multiple accreditation.

(b)The Secretary does not recognize the accreditation or preaccreditation of an otherwise eligible institution if that institution is accredited or preaccredited as an institution by more than one accrediting agency, unless the institution-

(1) Provides to each such accrediting agency and the Secretary the reasons for that multiple accreditation or preaccreditation;

(2) Demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for that multiple accreditation or preaccreditation.

(i) The Secretary determines the institution's cause for multiple accreditation to be reasonable unless the institution-

(A) Has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause during the preceding 24 months, unless such withdrawal, revocation, or termination has been rescinded by the same accrediting agency; or

(B) Has been subject to a probation or equivalent, show cause order, or suspension order during the preceding 24 months.

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, the Secretary may determine the institution's cause for seeking multiple accreditation or preaccreditation to be reasonable if the institution's primary interest in seeking multiple accreditation is based on that agency's geographic area, program-area focus, or mission; and

(3) Designates to the Secretary which agency's accreditation or preaccreditation the institution uses to establish its eligibility under this part.
