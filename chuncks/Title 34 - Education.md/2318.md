###### ยง 263.9 What are the payback requirements?
####### e.g.,

(3) Work-related payback is credited for the actual time the participant works, not for how the participant is paid (for work completed over 9 months but paid over 12 months, the payback credit is 9 months).

(4) For participants that initiate, but cannot complete, a work-related payback, the payback converts to a cash payback that is prorated based upon the amount of work-related payback completed.
