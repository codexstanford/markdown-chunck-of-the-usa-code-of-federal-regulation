###### ยง 222.24 How does a local educational agency that has multiple tax rates for real property classifications derive a single real property tax rate?

An LEA that has multiple tax rates for real property classifications derives a single tax rate for the purposes of determining its Section 7002 maximum payment by dividing the total revenues for current expenditures it received from local real property taxes by the total taxable value of real property located within the boundaries of the LEA. These data are from the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the applicant seeks assistance.
