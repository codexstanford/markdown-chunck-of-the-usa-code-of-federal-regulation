###### ยง 682.215 Income-based repayment plan.
####### Eligibility documentation, verification, and notifications.

(e)(1) The loan holder determines whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower elects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan. To make this determination, the loan holder requires the borrower to-

(i) Provide documentation, acceptable to the loan holder, of the borrower's AGI;

(ii) If the borrower's AGI is not available, or the loan holder believes that the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, provide other documentation to verify income;

(iii) If the spouse of a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return has eligible loans and the loan holder does not hold at least one of the spouse's eligible loans-

(A) Ensure that the borrower's spouse has provided consent for the loan holder to obtain information about the spouse's eligible loans from the National Student Loan Data System; or

(B) Provide other documentation, acceptable to the loan holder, of the spouse's eligible loan information; and

(iv) Annually certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the loan holder must assume a family size of one for that year.

(2) After making a determination that a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower initially elects the plan and for any subsequent year that the borrower has a partial financial hardship, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with-

(i) The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount, as calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment amount will apply (annual payment period);

(ii) Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the income-based repayment plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the loan holder must receive this information;

(iii) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (e)(7) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information;

(iv) An explanation of the consequences if the borrower no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan; and

(v) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the loan holder recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the loan holder recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.

(3) For each subsequent year that a borrower who currently has a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the loan holder must notify the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The notification must provide the borrower with-

(i) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the loan holder must receive all of the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (annual deadline); and

(ii) The consequences if the loan holder does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount, and the fact that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized at the end of the borrower's current annual payment period in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

(4) Each time a loan holder makes a determination that a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship for a subsequent year that the borrower wishes to remain on the plan, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with-

(i) The borrower's recalculated monthly payment amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

(ii) An explanation that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and

(iii) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time, that the loan holder redetermine whether the borrower has a partial financial hardship, if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount used to determine that the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship does not reflect the borrower's current income, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified annually of this option. If the loan holder determines that the borrower again has a partial financial hardship, the loan holder must recalculate the borrower's monthly payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and send the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.

(5) For each subsequent year that a borrower who does not currently have a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.

(6) If a borrower who is currently repaying under another repayment plan selects the income-based repayment plan but does not provide the documentation described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section, or if the loan holder determines that the borrower does not have a partial financial hardship, the borrower remains on his or her current repayment plan.

(7) The loan holder designates the repayment option described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if a borrower who is currently repaying under the income-based repayment plan remains on the plan for a subsequent year but the loan holder does not receive the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, unless the loan holder is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period.

(8) If the loan holder receives the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline-

(i) The loan holder must promptly determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount.

(ii) If the loan holder does not determine the new monthly payment amount by the end of the borrower's current annual payment period, the loan holder must prevent the borrower's monthly payment amount from being recalculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section and maintain the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the loan holder determines the new monthly payment amount.

(A) If the new monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount, the loan holder must make the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account to reflect any payments at the previously calculated amount that the borrower made after the end of the most recent annual payment period. Notwithstanding the requirements of ยง 682.209(b)(2)(ii), unless the borrower requests otherwise the loan holder applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(B) If the new monthly payment amount is equal to or greater than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount, the loan holder does not make any adjustments to the borrower's account.

(iii) The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.

(9) If the loan holder receives the documentation described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline and the borrower's monthly payment amount is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the loan holder may grant forbearance with respect to payments that are overdue or would be due at the time the new calculated income-based monthly payment amount is determined, if the new monthly payment amount is $0.00 or is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount. Interest that accrues during the portion of this forbearance period that covers payments that are overdue after the end of the prior annual payment period is not capitalized.
