() An entity established by an entity described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(1) of this section.

(C) A special purpose entity is a "related special purpose entity" with respect to a State or non-profit entity if it holds any interest in loans acquired from or at the direction of that State or non-profit entity or from a special purpose entity established by that State or non-profit entity.

(iii) An entity that otherwise qualifies under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section shall not be considered an eligible not-for-profit holder unless such entity-

(A) Was a State or non-profit entity and an eligible lender under section 435(d) of the Act, other than a school lender, and on or before September 27, 2007 had made or acquired a FFEL loan, unless the State waives this requirement under paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section; or

(B) Is acting as an eligible lender trustee on behalf of a State or non-profit entity that was the sole beneficial owner of a loan eligible for a special allowance payment on September 27, 2007.

(iv) Subject to the provisions of section 435(d)(1)(D) of the Act, a State may waive the requirement of paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) of this section to identify a new eligible not-for-profit holder pursuant to a written application filed in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(x) of this section, for the purposes of carrying out a public purpose of the State, except that a State may not designate a trustee for this purpose.

(v) A State or non-profit entity, and a trustee to the extent acting on behalf of such an entity or its related special purpose entity, shall not be an eligible not-for-profit holder if the State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity is owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by a for-profit entity. For purposes of this paragraph, a for-profit entity has ownership and control of a State or non-profit entity, or its related special purpose entity, if-

(A) The for-profit entity is a member or shareholder of a State or non-profit entity or related special purpose entity that is a membership or stock corporation, and the for-profit entity has sufficient power to control the State or non-profit entity or its special purpose entity;

(B) The for-profit-entity employs or appoints individuals that together constitute a majority of the State, non-profit, or special purpose entity's board of trustees or directors, or a majority of such board's audit committee, executive committee, or compensation committee; or

(C) For a State, non-profit, or special purpose entity that has no board of trustees or directors and associated committees of such, the for-profit entity is authorized by law, agreement, or otherwise to approve decisions by the entity regarding its audits, investments, hiring, retention, or compensation of officials, unless the Secretary determines that the particular authority to approve such decisions is not likely to affect the integrity of those decisions.

(vi) For purposes of paragraph (f)(3) of this section-

(A) A for-profit entity has sufficient power to control a State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity, if it possesses directly, or represents, either alone or together with other persons, under a voting trust, power of attorney, proxy, or similar agreement, one or more persons who hold, individually or in combination with the other person represented or the persons representing them, a sufficient voting percentage of the membership interests or voting securities to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity.

(B) An individual is deemed to be employed or appointed by a for-profit entity if the for-profit entity employs a family member, as defined in ยง 600.21(f), of that individual, unless the Secretary determines that the particular nature of the family member's employment is not likely to affect the integrity of decisions made by the board or committee member.

(C) "Beneficial owner" (including "beneficial ownership" and "owner of a beneficial interest") means the entity that has those rights with respect to the loan or income from the loan that are the normal incidents of ownership, including the right to receive, possess, use, and sell or otherwise exercise control over the loan and the income from the loan, subject to any rights granted and limitations imposed in connection with or related to the granting of a security interest described in paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, and subject to any limitations on such rights under the Act as a result of such entity not qualifying as an eligible lender or holder under the Act.

(D) "Sole owner" means the entity that has all the rights described in paragraph (f)(3)(vi)(C) of this section, which may be subject to the rights and limitations described in paragraph (f)(3)(vi)(C), to the exclusion of any other entity, with respect both to a loan and the income from a loan.

(vii)(A) No State or non-profit entity, and no trustee to the extent acting on behalf of such a State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity, shall be an eligible not-for-profit holder with respect to any loan or income from any loan on which payment is claimed at the rate established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, unless such State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity is the sole owner of the beneficial interest in such loan and the income from such loan.

(B) A State or non-profit entity that had sole ownership of the beneficial interest in a loan and the income from such loan is considered to retain that sole ownership for purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(A) of this section if such entity transferred beneficial interest in the loan to its related special purpose entity and no party other than that State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity owns any beneficial interest or residual ownership interest in the loan or income from the loan.

(viii)(A) A trustee described in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(D) of this section shall not receive compensation as consideration for acting as an eligible lender on behalf of a State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity in excess of reasonable and customary fees paid for providing the particular service or services that the trustee undertakes to provide to such entity.

(B) Fees are reasonable and customary for purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of this section, if they do not exceed the amounts received by the trustee for similar services with regard to similar portfolios of loans of that State or non-profit entity or its related special purpose entity that are not eligible to receive special allowance at the rate established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, or if they do not exceed an amount as determined by such other method requested by the State or non-profit entity that the Secretary considers reliable.

(C) Loans owned by the State or non-profit entity or a related special purpose entity for which the trustee receives fees in excess of the amount permitted by paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of this section cease to qualify for a special allowance payment at the rate prescribed under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(ix) For purposes of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if a State or non-profit entity, its related special purpose entity, or a trustee acting on behalf of any of these entities, grants a security interest in, or otherwise pledges as collateral, a loan, or the income from a loan, to secure a debt obligation for which such State or non-profit entity, or its related special purpose entity, is the issuer of that debt obligation, none of these entities shall, by such action-

(A) Be deemed to be owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by a for-profit entity; or

(B) Lose its status as the sole owner of a beneficial interest in a loan and the income from a loan.
