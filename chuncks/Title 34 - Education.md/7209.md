####### Post-active duty student deferment.

(u)(1) Effective October 1, 2007, a borrower who receives a FFEL Program loan and is serving on active duty on that date, or begins serving on or after that date, is entitled to receive a post-active duty student deferment for 13 months following the conclusion of the borrower's active duty military service and any applicable grace period if-

(i) The borrower is a member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or a member of such forces in retired status; and

(ii) The borrower was enrolled, on at least a half-time basis, in a program of instruction at an eligible institution at the time, or within six months prior to the time, the borrower was called to active duty.

(2) As used in paragraph (u)(1) of this section, "active duty" means active duty as defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code for at least a 30-day period, except that-

(i) Active duty includes active State duty for members of the National Guard under which a Governor activates National Guard personnel based on State statute or policy and the activities of the National Guard are paid for with State funds;

(ii) Active duty includes full-time National Guard duty under which a Governor is authorized, with the approval of the President or the U.S. Secretary of Defense, to order a member to State active duty and the activities of the National Guard are paid for with Federal funds;

(iii) Active duty does not include active duty for training or attendance at a service school; and

(iv) Active duty does not include employment in a full-time, permanent position in the National Guard unless the borrower employed in such a position is reassigned to active duty under paragraph (u)(2)(i) of this section or full-time National Guard duty under paragraph (u)(2)(ii) of this section.

(3) If the borrower returns to enrolled student status, on at least a half-time basis, during the 13-month deferment period, the deferment expires at the time the borrower returns to enrolled student status, on at least a half-time basis.

(4) If a borrower qualifies for both a military service deferment and a post-active duty student deferment, the 180-day post-demobilization military service deferment period and the 13-month post-active duty student deferment period apply concurrently.

(5) To receive a post-active duty student deferment, the borrower must request the deferment and provide the lender with all information and documents required to establish eligibility for the deferment, except that a lender may grant a borrower a post-active duty student deferment under the procedures specified in paragraphs (s)(1)(iii) through (s)(1)(v) of this section.
