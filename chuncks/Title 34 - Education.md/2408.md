####### Need for assistance.

(b)The Secretary evaluates the applicant's need for assistance under this part, by considering-

(1) The costs of fully implementing the magnet schools project as proposed;

(2) The resources available to the applicant to carry out the project if funds under the program were not provided;

(3) The extent to which the costs of the project exceed the applicant's resources; and

(4) The difficulty of effectively carrying out the approved plan and the project for which assistance is sought, including consideration of how the design of the magnet school project-e.g., the type of program proposed, the location of the magnet school within the LEA-impacts on the applicant's ability to successfully carry out the approved plan.
