####### Accounting for operating leases.

(d)The Secretary accounts for operating leases by-

(1) Applying FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to all leases the institution has entered into on or after December 15, 2018 (post-implementation operating/financing leases), as specified in the Supplemental Schedule (see Section 2 of Appendix A to this subpart and Section 2 of Appendix B to this subpart);

(2) Treating leases the institution entered into prior to December 15, 2018 (pre-implementation operating/financing leases), as they would have been treated prior to the requirements of ASU 2016-02, as long as the institution provides information about those leases on the Supplemental Schedule and a note in, or on the face of, its audited financial statements; and

(3) Accounting for any adjustments, such as any options exercised by the institution to extend the life of a pre-implementation operating/finance lease, as post-implementation operating/finance leases.
