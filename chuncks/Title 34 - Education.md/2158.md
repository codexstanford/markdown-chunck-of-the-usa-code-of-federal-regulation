####### Note to paragraph (a):

The Secretary encourages applicants requesting an Impact Aid hearing to mail or email their requests. Because of enhanced security procedures, building access for non-official staff may be limited. Applicants should be prepared to mail their hearing requests if they or their courier are unable to obtain access to the building.

(b) Clearly specify in its written hearing request the issues of fact and law to be considered; and

(c) Furnish a copy of its hearing request to its State educational agency (SEA) (unless the applicant is an SEA).
