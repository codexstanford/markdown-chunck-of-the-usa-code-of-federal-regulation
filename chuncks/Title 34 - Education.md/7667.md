(a) A school shall certify that the information it provides in connection with a loan application about the borrower and, in the case of a parent borrower, the student for whom the loan is intended, is complete and accurate. Except as provided in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E, a school may rely in good faith upon statements made by the borrower and, in the case of a parent borrower of a PLUS loan, the student and the parent borrower.

(b) The information to be provided by the school about the borrower pertains to-

(1) The borrower's eligibility for a loan, as determined in accordance with § 682.201 and § 682.204;

(3) The schedule for disbursement of the loan proceeds, which must reflect the delivery of the loan proceeds as set forth in section 428G of the Act.

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, in certifying a loan, a school must certify a loan for the lesser of the borrower's request or the loan limits determined under § 682.204.

(2) Exceeds the student's estimated cost of attendance for the period of enrollment, less-

(i) The student's estimated financial assistance for that period; and

(ii) In the case of a Subsidized Stafford loan, the borrower's expected family contribution for that period.

(f)(1)(i) The minimum period of enrollment for which a school may certify a loan application is-

(A) At a school that measures academic progress in credit hours and uses a semester, trimester, or quarter system, or has terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, a single term (e.g., a semester or quarter); or
