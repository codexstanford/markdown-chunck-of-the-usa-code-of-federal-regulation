####### Local tax revenues

means compulsory charges levied by an LEA or by an intermediate school district or other local governmental entity on behalf of an LEA for current expenditures for educational services. "Local tax revenues" include the proceeds of ad valorem taxes, sales and use taxes, income taxes and other taxes. Where a State funding formula requires a local contribution equivalent to a specified mill tax levy on taxable real or personal property or both, "local tax revenues" include any revenues recognized by the State as satisfying that local contribution requirement.
