###### ยง 650.41 How are institutional payments to be administered?

(a) With respect to the awards made for the academic year 1998-1999, the Secretary makes a payment of $10,222 to the institution of higher education for each individual awarded a fellowship for pursuing a course of study at the institution. The Secretary adjusts the amount of the institutional payment annually thereafter in accordance with inflation as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year.

(b) If the institution of higher education charges and collects amounts from a fellow for tuition or other expenses required by the institution as part of the fellow's instructional program, the Secretary deducts that amount from the institutional payment.

(c) If the fellow is enrolled for less than a full academic year, the Secretary pays the institution a pro rata share of the allowance.
