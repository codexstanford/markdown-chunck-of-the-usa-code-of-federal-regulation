###### ยง 222.18 What amount does the Secretary forgive?
####### Forgiveness in part.

(b)(1) The Secretary forgives the eligible overpayment in part if the Secretary determines that the LEA meets the requirements of ยง 222.17 (undue financial hardship), and the LEA's preceding fiscal year's current expenditure closing balance is more than ten percent of its TCE for that year.

(2) For an eligible overpayment that is forgiven in part, the Secretary-

(i) Requires the LEA to repay the amount by which the LEA's preceding fiscal year's current expenditure closing balance exceeded ten percent of its preceding fiscal year's TCE ("calculated repayment amount"); and

(ii) Forgives the difference between the calculated repayment amount and the LEA's total overpayments.

(3) For the purposes of this section, "current expenditure closing balance" means an LEA's closing balance before any revocable transfers to non-current expenditure accounts, such as capital outlay or debt service accounts.
