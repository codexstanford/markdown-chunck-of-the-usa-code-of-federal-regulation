###### Inadequacies of Existing Facilities

means an allowance that is earned on a percentage basis depending on the degree of inadequacy considering both public and nonpublic facilities. Overall plant requirements are determined based on the relationship between the maximum enrollment accommodated in the present facilities, excluding double and night sessions and the anticipated enrollment if the facilities are transferred. Inadequacies may be computed for a component school unit such as a school farm, athletic field, facility for home economics, round-out school site, cafeteria, auditorium, teacherages, faculty housing, etc., only if the component is required to meet State standards. In that event, the State Department of Education will be required to provide a certification of the need. Component school unit inadequacies may only be related to a particular school and not to the entire school system.
