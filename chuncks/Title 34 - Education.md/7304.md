####### Average daily balance method for special allowance.

(d)(1) To compute the average daily balance outstanding for purposes of special allowance, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on all qualified loans at each applicable interest rate for each day of the quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at each applicable interest rate.

(2) To compute the average daily balance of unpaid accrued interest for purposes of special allowance on loans covered by ยง 682.215(b)(7), the lender adds the unpaid accrued interest on such loans for each eligible day of the quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at the applicable interest rate.

(3) The Secretary computes the special allowance payable to a lender based upon the average daily balance computed by the lender under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
