###### ยง 690.75 Determination of eligibility for payment.

(2) Is enrolled in an eligible program as an undergraduate student; and

(3) If enrolled in a credit hour program without terms or a clock hour program, has completed the payment period as defined in ยง 668.4 for which he or she has been paid a Federal Pell Grant.

(b) If an institution determines at the beginning of a payment period that a student is not maintaining satisfactory progress, but reverses that determination before the end of the payment period, the institution may pay a Federal Pell Grant to the student for the entire payment period.
