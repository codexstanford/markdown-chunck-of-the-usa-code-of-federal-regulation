####### Penalty interest.

(b)(1)(i) If the Secretary does not pay interest benefits or the special allowance within 30 days after the Secretary receives an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from a lender, the Secretary pays the lender penalty interest.

(ii) The payment of interest benefits or special allowance is deemed to occur, for purposes of this paragraph, when the Secretary-

(A) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the lender;

(B) Credits the payment due the lender against a debt that the Secretary determines is owed the Secretary by the lender; or

(C) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the amount due by the lender to another Federal agency for credit against a debt that the Federal agency has determined the lender owes.

(2) Penalty interest is an amount that accrues daily on interest benefits and special allowance due to the lender. The penalty interest is computed by-

(i) Multiplying the daily interest rate applicable to loans on which payment for interest benefits was requested, by the amount of interest benefits due on those loans for each interest rate;

(ii) Multiplying the daily special allowance rate applicable to loans on which special allowance was requested by the amount of special allowance due on those loans for each interest rate and special allowance category;

(iii) Adding the results of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to determine the gross penalty interest to be paid for each day that penalty interest is due;

(iv) Dividing the results of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section by the gross amount of interest benefits and special allowance due to obtain the average penalty interest rate;

(v) Multiplying the rate obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section by the total amount of reduction to gross interest benefits and special allowance due (e.g., origination fees or other debts owed to the Federal Government);

(vi) Subtracting the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section from the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section to obtain the net amount of penalty interest due per day; and

(vii) Multiplying the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section by the number of days calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(3) The Secretary pays penalty interest for the period-

(i) Beginning on the later of-

(A) The 31st day after the final day of the quarter covered by the request for payment; or

(B) The 31st day after the Secretary's receipt of an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from the lender; and

(ii) Ending on the day the Secretary pays the interest benefits and the special allowance at issue, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(4) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is considered timely only if it is received by the Secretary within 90 days following the end of the quarter to which the request pertains.

(5) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is not considered accurate and complete if it-

(i) Requests payments to which the lender is not entitled under §§ 682.300 through 682.302;

(ii) Includes loans that the Secretary, in writing, has directed that the lender exclude from the request;

(iii) Does not contain all information required by the Secretary or contains conflicting information; or

(iv) Is not provided and certified on the form and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary.
