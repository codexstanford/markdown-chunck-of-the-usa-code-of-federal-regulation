###### § 668.91 Initial and final decisions.

(a)(1)(i) A hearing official issues a written initial decision in a hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested to-

(A) The designated department official who began a proceeding against an institution or third-party servicer;

(B) The institution or servicer, as applicable; and

(C) In the case of a proceeding against a third-party servicer, each institution that contracts with the servicer.

(ii) The hearing official may also transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means if practical.

(iii) The hearing official issues the decision within the latest of the following dates:

(A) The 30th day after the last submission is filed with the hearing official.

(B) The 60th day after the last submission is filed with the hearing official if the Secretary, upon request of the hearing official, determines that the unusual complexity of the case requires additional time for preparation of the decision.

(C) The 50th day after the last day of the hearing, if the hearing official does not request the parties to make any posthearing submission.

(2)(i) The hearing official's initial decision states whether the imposition of the fine, limitation, suspension, or termination or recovery sought by the designated department official is warranted, in whole or in part. If the designated department official brought a termination action against the institution or servicer, the hearing official may, if appropriate, issue an initial decision to fine the institution or servicer, as applicable, or, rather than terminating the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility, as applicable, impose one or more limitations on the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility.

(ii) In a borrower defense and recovery proceeding conducted in two phases under § 668.87(a)(1)(iv)(B), the hearing official's initial decision determines whether the institution is liable for the act or omission described in the notice of intent to recover, and the hearing official issues an initial decision on liability only.

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section-

(i) If, in a termination action against an institution, the hearing official finds that the institution has violated the provisions of § 668.14(b)(18), the hearing official also finds that termination of the institution's participation is warranted;

(ii) If, in a termination action against a third-party servicer, the hearing official finds that the servicer has violated the provisions of § 668.14(b)(18), the hearing official also finds that termination of the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility is warranted;

(iii) In an action brought against an institution or third-party servicer that involves its failure to provide a letter of credit, or other financial protection under § 668.15 or § 668.171(c) or (d), the hearing official finds that the amount of the letter of credit or other financial protection established by the Secretary under § 668.175 is appropriate, unless the institution demonstrates that the amount was not warranted because-

(A) For financial protection demanded based on events or conditions described in § 668.171(c) or (d), the events or conditions no longer exist, have been resolved, or the institution demonstrates that it has insurance that will cover all potential debts and liabilities that arise from the triggering event or condition. The institution can demonstrate it has insurance that covers risk by presenting the Department with a copy of the insurance policy that makes clear the institution's coverage;

(B) For financial protection demanded based on the grounds identified in § 668.171(d), the action or event does not and will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, or results of operations of the institution;

(C) The institution has proffered alternative financial protection that provides students and the Department adequate protection against losses resulting from the risks identified by the Secretary. Adequate protection may consist of one or more of the following-
