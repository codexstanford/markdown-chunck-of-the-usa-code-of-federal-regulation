###### ยง 222.162 What disparity standard must a State meet in order to be certified and how are disparities in current expenditures or revenues per pupil measured?
####### Per pupil figure computations.

(c)In calculating the current expenditures or revenue disparities under this section, computations of per pupil figures are made on one of the following bases:

(1) The per pupil amount of current expenditures or revenue for an LEA is computed on the basis of the total number of pupils receiving free public education in the schools of the agency. The total number of pupils is determined in accordance with whatever standard measurement of pupil count is used in the State.

(2) If a State aid program uses "weighted pupil," "classroom," "instructional unit," or another designated measure of need in determining allocations of State aid to take account of special cost differentials, the computation of per pupil revenue or current expenditures may be made using one of the methods in paragraph (d) of this section. The two allowable categories of special cost differentials are-

(i) Those associated with pupils having special educational needs, such as children with disabilities, economically disadvantaged children, non-English speaking children, and gifted and talented children; and

(ii) Those associated with particular types of LEAs such as those affected by geographical isolation, sparsity or density of population, high cost of living, or special socioeconomic characteristics within the area served by an LEA.
