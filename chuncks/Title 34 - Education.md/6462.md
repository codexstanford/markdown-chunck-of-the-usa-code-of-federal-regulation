####### Scheduled to complete.

(e)In calculating a completion or placement rate under this section, the date on which a student is originally scheduled to complete a program is based on-

(1) For a student who is initially enrolled full-time, the amount of time specified in your enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials for completion of the program by a full-time student; or

(2) For a student who is initially enrolled less than full-time, the amount of time that it would take the student to complete the program if the student remained at that level of enrollment throughout the program.
