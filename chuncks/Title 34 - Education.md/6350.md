(B) For any year in which the institution's enrolled students open 30 or more financial accounts marketed under the T2 arrangement, the number of students who had financial accounts under the contract at any time during the most recently completed award year, and the mean and median of the actual costs incurred by those account holders;

(v) Ensure that the items under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section are posted at the URL that is sent to the Secretary under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section for publication in a centralized database accessible to the public;

(vi) Ensure that the student accountholder can execute balance inquiries and access funds deposited in the financial accounts through surcharge-free in-network ATMs sufficient in number and housed and serviced such that the funds are reasonably available to the accountholder, including at the times the institution or its third-party servicer makes direct payments into them;

(vii) Ensure that the financial accounts are not marketed or portrayed as, or converted into, credit cards;

(viii) Ensure that the terms of the accounts offered pursuant to a T2 arrangement are not inconsistent with the best financial interests of the students opening them. The Secretary considers this requirement to be met if-

(A) The institution documents that it conducts reasonable due diligence reviews at least every two years to ascertain whether the fees imposed under the T2 arrangement are, considered as a whole, consistent with or below prevailing market rates; and

(B) All contracts for the marketing or offering of accounts pursuant to T2 arrangements to the institution's students make provision for termination of the arrangement by the institution based on complaints received from students or a determination by the institution under paragraph (f)(4)(viii)(A) of this section that the fees assessed under the T2 arrangement are not consistent with or are above prevailing market rates;

(ix) Take affirmative steps, by way of contractual arrangements with the financial institution as necessary, to ensure that requirements of this section are met with respect to all accounts offered pursuant to T2 arrangements; and

(x) Ensure students incur no cost for opening the account or initially receiving or validating an access device.

(xii) Institutions falling below the thresholds described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the applicable provisions of paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5) of this section.

(5) The requirements of paragraph (f)(4) of this section no longer apply with respect to a student who has an account described under paragraph (f)(1) of this section when the student is no longer enrolled at the institution and there are no pending title IV disbursements, except that nothing in this paragraph should be construed to limit the institution's responsibility to comply with paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section with respect to students enrolled during the award year for which the institution is reporting. To effectuate this provision, an institution may share information related to students' enrollment status with the financial institution or entity that is party to the arrangement.
