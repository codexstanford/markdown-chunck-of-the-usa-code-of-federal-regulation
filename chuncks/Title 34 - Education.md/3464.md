(b) Establish dates by which those EIS providers must report to the lead agency to ensure that the State complies with § 303.721(a);

(c) Obtain certification from each EIS provider that an unduplicated and accurate count has been made;

(d) Aggregate the data from the count obtained from each EIS provider and prepare the report required under §§ 303.721 through 303.723; and

(e) Ensure that documentation is maintained to enable the State and the Secretary to audit the accuracy of the count.
