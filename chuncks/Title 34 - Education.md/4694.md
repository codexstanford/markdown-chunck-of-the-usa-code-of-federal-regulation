###### ยง 600.31 Change in ownership resulting in a change in control for private nonprofit, private for-profit and public institutions.
####### Publicly traded corporations required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

(2)A change in ownership and control occurs when-

(i) A person acquires such ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Form 8K with the SEC notifying that agency of the change in control; or

(ii) (A) A person who is a controlling shareholder of the corporation ceases to be a controlling shareholder. A controlling shareholder is a shareholder who holds or controls through agreement both 25 percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more shares of voting stock than any other shareholder. A controlling shareholder for this purpose does not include a shareholder whose sole stock ownership is held as a U.S. institutional investor, as defined in 17 CFR 240.15a-6(b)(7), held in mutual funds, held through a profit-sharing plan, or held in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).

(B) When a change of ownership occurs as a result of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the institution may submit its most recent quarterly financial statement as filed with the SEC, along with copies of all other SEC filings made after the close of the fiscal year for which a compliance audit has been submitted to the Department of Education, instead of the "same day" balance sheet.

(C) If a publicly-traded institution is provisionally certified due to a change in ownership under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and that institution experiences another change of ownership under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, an approval of the subsequent change in ownership does not extend the original expiration date for the provisional certification provided that any current controlling shareholder was listed on the change of ownership application for which the original provisional approval was granted.
