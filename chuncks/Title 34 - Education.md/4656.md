###### § 600.11 Special rules regarding institutional accreditation or preaccreditation.
####### Change of accrediting agencies.

(a)(1) For purposes of §§ 600.4(a)(5)(i), 600.5(a)(6), and 600.6(a)(5)(i), the Secretary does not recognize the accreditation or preaccreditation of an otherwise eligible institution if that institution is in the process of changing its accrediting agency, unless the institution provides the following to the Secretary and receives approval:

(i) All materials related to its prior accreditation or preaccreditation.

(ii) Materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing its accrediting agency. The Secretary will not determine such cause to be reasonable if the institution-

(A) Has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause during the preceding 24 months, unless such withdrawal, revocation, or termination has been rescinded by the same accrediting agency; or

(B) Has been subject to a probation or equivalent, show cause order, or suspension order during the preceding 24 months.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the Secretary may determine the institution's cause for changing its accrediting agency to be reasonable if the agency did not provide the institution its due process rights as defined in § 602.25, the agency applied its standards and criteria inconsistently, or if the adverse action or show cause or suspension order was the result of an agency's failure to respect an institution's stated mission, including religious mission.
