The initial date of receipt of the written notice must be documented by a date stamp.

(ii) A collection history, if any;

(iii) A proof of claim, where applicable;

(iv) An assignment to the United States of America of its proof of claim, where applicable;

(v) All pertinent documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court;

(vi) A statement of any facts of which the lender is aware that may form the basis for an objection to the bankrupt's discharge or an exception to the discharge;

(vii) The notice of the first meeting or creditors, or an explanation as to why this is not included;

(viii) In cases where there is defective service, a declaration or affidavit attesting to the fact that the lender or holder was not directly served with the notice of meeting of creditors. This declaration or affidavit must also indicate when and how the lender or holder learned of the bankruptcy; and

(ix) In cases where there is defective service due to the borrower's failure to list the proper creditor, a copy of the letter sent to the borrower at the time of purchase of the HEAL loan by the current holder, or a sample letter with documentation indicating when the letter was sent to the borrower.
