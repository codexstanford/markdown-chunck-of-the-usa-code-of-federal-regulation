(b)(1) A Direct Loan borrower is eligible for a deferment during any period during which-

(ii) The borrower is not serving in a medical internship or residency program, except for a residency program in dentistry.

(2) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Secretary processes a deferment when-

(i) The borrower submits a request to the Secretary along with documentation verifying the borrower's eligibility;

(ii) The Secretary receives information from the borrower's school indicating that the borrower is eligible to receive a new loan;

(iii) The Secretary receives student status information from the borrower's school, either directly or indirectly, indicating that the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis; or

(iv) The Secretary confirms a borrower's half-time enrollment status through the use of the National Student Loan Data System if requested to do so by the school the borrower is attending.

(3)(i) Upon notification by the Secretary that a deferment has been granted based on paragraph (b)(2)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, the borrower has the option to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan.

(ii) If the borrower elects to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan, the borrower has the option to make the principal and interest payments that were deferred. If the borrower does not make the payments, the Secretary applies a deferment for the period in which payments were not made and capitalizes the interest.
