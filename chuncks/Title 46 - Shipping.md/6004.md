(a) A vessel must be provided with a satisfactory arrangement for draining any watertight compartment, other than small buoyancy compartments, under all practicable conditions. Sluice valves are not permitted in watertight bulkheads.

(b) Special consideration may be given to vessels, such as high speed craft, which have a high degree of subdivision and utilize numerous small buoyancy compartments. Where the probability of flooding of the space is limited to external hull damage, compartment drainage may be omitted provided it can be shown by stability calculations, submitted to the cognizant OCMI, that the safety of the vessel will not be impaired.
