###### ยง 385.37 Requirement for unrestricted solicitations for discretionary assistance awards.
####### Policy.

(a)It is MarAd policy to maximize the opportunity for prospective recipients to be considered for assistance awards where eligibility is not prescribed by law. Therefore, when eligibility is not prescribed by law or a final program regulation, and when discretionary assistance awards are selected to accomplish a program objective, applications or proposals will be obtained, wherever practicable, by issuance of a written solicitation. When MarAd initiates the solicitation of applications or proposals, eligibility to be considered for discretionary awards will not be restricted by MarAd to one category of recipients or to a single recipient without adequate basis.
