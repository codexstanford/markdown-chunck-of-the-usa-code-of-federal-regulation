####### Unit feed system.

(e)Unit feed systems shall be provided with pumps and piping as follows:

(1) The unit feed system may be used on vessels having two or more boilers. When the unit feed system is employed each boiler shall have its own independently driven main feed pump capable of supplying the boiler at its normal operating capacity. In addition these shall be an auxiliary independently driven feed pump of the same capacity which can be operated in place of and in conjunction with the main feed pump. In vessels with three or more boilers, not more than two boilers may be served by any one auxiliary pump. The auxiliary pump may be so interconnected that any pump can feed any boiler.

(2) In the unit feed system, a separate feed line shall be provided for each boiler from its pumps. A separate auxiliary feed line is not required. The discharge from each pump and the feed supply to each boiler shall be automatically controlled by the level of the water in that boiler. In addition to the automatic control, manual control shall be provided.
