####### Control system details.

(e)(1) Each operator control device must have a detent at the zero thrust position.

(2) Propulsion machinery automatic safety trip control operation must only occur when continued operation could result in serious damage, complete breakdown, or explosion of the equipment. Other than the overrides mentioned in ยง 62.25-10(a)(4) and temporary overrides located at the main navigating bridge control location, overrides of these safety trip controls are prohibited. Operation of permitted overrides must be alarmed at the navigating bridge and at the maneuvering platform or ECC, as applicable, and must be guarded against inadvertent operation.

(3) Remote propulsion control systems must be failsafe by maintaining the preset (as is) speed and direction of thrust until local manual or alternate manual control is in operation, or the manual safety trip control operates. Failure must activate alarms on the navigating bridge and in the machinery spaces.
