(1) Wooden ships of primitive build;

(2) Unrigged vessels; and

(3) Vessels of less than 200 GRT.

(b) Endorsements as master or mate of uninspected fishing industry vessels are issued for either ocean or near-coastal routes, depending on the examination completed. To qualify for an uninspected fishing industry vessel endorsement, the applicant must satisfy the training and examination requirements of ยง 11.201(h)(1) of this part.

(c) An applicant for an endorsement as master of uninspected fishing industry vessels must have 4 years of total service on ocean or near-coastal routes. Service on Great Lakes or inland waters may substitute for up to 2 years of the required service. One year of the required service must have been as master, mate, or equivalent position while holding a license or MMC endorsement as master or mate of self-propelled vessels, or master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels, or OUPV.

(1) To qualify for an endorsement for less than 500 GRT, at least 2 years of the required service, including the 1 year as master, mate, or equivalent, must have been on vessels of 50 GRT or more.

(3) To qualify for an endorsement for more than 1,600 GRT, but not more than 5,000 GRT, the vessel tonnage upon which the 4 years of required service was obtained will be used to compute the tonnage. The endorsement is limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25 percent of the required service was obtained or 150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated.

(ii) Six months of service as master on a vessel results in a limitation in that capacity equal to 150 percent of the tonnage of that vessel.

(iii) Six months of service as master on vessels more than 1,600 GRT results in raising the limitation to 5,000 GRT.

(iv) Six months of service as mate on vessels more than 1,600 GRT results in raising the limitation for master to the tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained.

(v) Two years of service as a deckhand on a vessel while holding a license or MMC endorsement as master results in a limitation on the MMC equal to 150 percent of the tonnage of that vessel up to 5,000 GRT.

(3) To qualify for an endorsement of more than 1,600 GRT, but not more than 5,000 GRT, the vessel tonnage upon which the 3 years of required service was obtained will be used to compute the tonnage. The endorsement is limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25 percent of the required service was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated.

(4) The tonnage limitation on this endorsement may be raised using one of the following methods, but cannot exceed 5,000 GRT. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated.
