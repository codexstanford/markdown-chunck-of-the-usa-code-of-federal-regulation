####### Platform strength.

(2)If the pilot hoist has a lift platform, the platform is lifted to a level where it is supported only by its suspension components. A static load of 900 kilograms (2000 pounds) is then applied to the center of the platform for one minute. The load must be uniformly distributed over a 100 millimeter (4 inch) square contact surface. The test must be repeated enough additional times so that the load is placed in the center of each hatch cover when in its closed position, and in the center of each area of the platform located between floor supports. The platform must not break or crack during these tests.
