###### Cranes.

(9)(a) Plan approval will not normally be required of any crane which conforms to the specifications of the manufacturer as originally installed. A rated load test as described in ยง 107.260 of Subchapter IA will be required unless the crane has been load tested while under certification by an approved certifying authority as provided for in 46 CFR 107.258. Prior to the rated load test, the crane should be identified by manufacturer and model number to determine that the correct load rating chart is being used. The owner must submit to the OCMI details and calculations of any alterations to a crane which were accomplished without manufacturer's documentation in order to verify the rated load of the crane.
