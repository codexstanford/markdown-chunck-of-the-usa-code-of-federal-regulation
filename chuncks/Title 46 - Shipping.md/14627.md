###### Payments on indebtedness.

(b)Payments on indebtedness may constitute qualified withdrawals only if the party shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation a direct connection between incurring the indebtedness and the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or its complement of barges and containers whether or not the indebtedness is secured by the vessel or its complement of barges and containers. The fact that an indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified vessel, barge, or container is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the necessary connection.
