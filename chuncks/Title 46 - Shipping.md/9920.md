####### Test No. 1A.

(1)The separator is filled with water and started. Next, the separator is fed with pure Test Fluid A for at least 5 minutes and then with a mixture of Test Fluid A and water influent containing Test Fluid A content of between 5,000 and 10,000 ppm until a steady flow rate at a steady, constant ppm occurs. After the flow rate is steady, the influent is fed to the separator for 30 minutes. Samples of separated water effluent are taken after the first 10 and 20 minutes. At the end of the 30-minute period, the air cock on the test rig is opened and, if necessary, the oil and water supply valves are closed to stop the flow of influent. A sample is then taken of the separated water effluent as the effluent flow ceases.
