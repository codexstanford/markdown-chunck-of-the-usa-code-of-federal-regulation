####### Cargo identification/name.,see

(a)This column identifies cargoes by name. Words in italics are not part of the cargo name but may be used in addition to the cargo name. When one entry references another entry by use of the word "see" and both names are in roman type, either name may be used as the cargo name (e.g., "Diethyl eitherEthyl ether"). However, the referenced entry is preferred.
