####### Buoyancy test.

(e)Known weights are loaded on the sample buoyant apparatus until it is awash. The buoyancy is the downward force exerted by the weights loaded on the apparatus. A raised platform of known weight having two runners on edge spaced so as to bear on the apparatus may be used to support the weights out of water to avoid the necessity for making allowances for the displacement of submerged weights. This test is not a required production test if the manufacturer-

(1) Uses the same plastic buoyancy foam used in previous production lots,

(2) Determines that the density of each batch of foam used is within a range specified on the approved plans, and

(3) Closely controls the amount of foam used in each apparatus.
