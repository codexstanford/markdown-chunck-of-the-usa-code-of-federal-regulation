(c)().

(1) Each socket weld must conform to ASME B16.11 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2), to applicable standards listed in 46 CFR 56.60-1, table 56.60-1(b), and to Figure 127.4.4C in ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) as modified by § 56.30-10(b)(4) of this part. A gap of approximately one-sixteenth inch between the end of the pipe and the bottom of the socket must be provided before welding. This may best be provided by bottoming the pipe and backing off slightly before tacking.

(2) Socket welds must not be used where severe erosion or crevice corrosion is expected to occur. Restrictions on the use of socket welds appear in § 56.70-15(d)(3) of this part for Class I service and in § 56.50-105 of this part for low temperature service. These sections should be checked when designing for these systems. See § 56.70-15(d)(4) of this part for Class II service.
