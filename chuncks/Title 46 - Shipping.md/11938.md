(a) Spaces containing machinery which uses, or tanks which contain, fuel having a flashpoint of 110 &#xB0;F. or lower shall have natural supply and mechanical exhaust ventilation as required by this section.

(b) The mechanical exhaust system shall be such as to assure the air changes as noted in Table 190.15-5(b) depending on the size of the space.

(c) Exhaust blower motors, unless of a totally enclosed, explosion-proof type, shall be located outside of the ducts and outside of the compartment required to be ventilated. Exhaust blower motors if mounted in any compartment shall be located as high above the bilge as practicable. Blower blades shall be nonsparking with reference to their housings.

(d) Exhaust blower switches shall be located outside of any space required to be ventilated by this section, and shall be of the type interlocked with the ignition switch so that the blowers are started before the engine ignition is switched on. A red warning sign at the switch shall state that the blowers shall be operated prior to starting the engines for a sufficient time to insure at least one complete change of air in the compartments.
