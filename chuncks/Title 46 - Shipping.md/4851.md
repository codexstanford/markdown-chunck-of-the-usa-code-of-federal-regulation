####### Widely-separated locations

as the term applies to the location of lifeboats on self-elevating units, means locations on different sides or ends of the unit separated by sufficient distance or structure to protect the lifeboats in one location from a fire or explosion occurring at or near the lifeboats in another location on the unit. Locations across from each other at the apex of a unit with a triangular deck are not widely-separated locations unless there is a substantial solid structure between them.
