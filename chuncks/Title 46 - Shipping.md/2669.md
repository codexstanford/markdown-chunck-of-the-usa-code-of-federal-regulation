(3) In certain types of vessels where the boiler foundation forms the ashpit, such foundations shall be efficiently ventilated, except in cases where the ashpit is partially filled with water at all times.

(4) The pans of oil-burning, watertube boilers shall be arranged to prevent oil from leaking into the bilges and shall be lined with firebrick or other heat resisting material.

(5) The distance between a boiler and a compartment containing fuel oil shall not be less than 24 inches at the back end of a boiler and 18 inches elsewhere, except that for a cylindrical part of a boiler or a knuckle in the casing of a water-tube boiler, these distances may be reduced to 18 inches, provided all parts are readily accessible for inspection and repair.
