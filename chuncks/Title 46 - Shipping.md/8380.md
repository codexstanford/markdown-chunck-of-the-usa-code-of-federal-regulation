####### Materials.

(a)All materials used in the construction of impulse-projected rocket type line-throwing appliances and equipment shall be of good quality suitable for the purpose intended, and shall conform to this subpart and to the specifications submitted by the manufacturer and approved by the Commandant. The choice of materials, when there is no specific requirement, shall be such that maximum safety to operating personnel will be maintained, and that resistance to corrosion by salt water or spray, shock, temperature change, and wear will be obtained. The use of dissimilar materials in combination shall be avoided wherever possible, but when such contacts are necessary, provision shall be made to prevent such deleterious effects as galvanic corrosion, freezing or buckling of moving parts, and loosening or tightening of joints due to differences in coefficients of thermal expansion.
