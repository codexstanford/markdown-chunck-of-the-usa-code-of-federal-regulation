###### § 174.255 Restricted service.
####### Damaged stability.

(b)(1) Each liftboat must be designed so that, while it is in each of its normal operating conditions, its final equilibrium waterline will remain below the lowest edge of any opening through which additional flooding can occur if the liftboat is subjected simultaneously to-

(i) Damage causing flooding described by paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

(ii) A wind heeling moment calculated in compliance with § 174.055(b) using a wind speed of 50 knots.

(2) Each liftboat must have a means of closing off each pipe, ventilation system, and trunk in each compartment described by paragraph (b)(4) of this section if any part of the pipe, ventilation system, or trunk is within 760 millimeters (30 inches) of the hull.

(3) For compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, no compartment on the liftboat may be ballasted or pumped out to compensate for the flooding described by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(4) For compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, each compartment within 760 millimeters (30 inches) of the hull, excluding the bottom of the liftboat, between two adjacent main watertight bulkheads and the uppermost continuous deck or first superstructure deck where superstructures are fitted must be assumed subject to simultaneous flooding.

(5) In the calculations required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the permeability of a floodable space must be as listed by Table 174.205(d).
