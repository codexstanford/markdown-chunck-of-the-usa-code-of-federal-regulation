###### acquisition

(3) For purposes of this section, the termmeans any of the following:

(i) Any acquisition, but only to the extent the basis of the property acquired in the hands of the transferee is its cost. Thus, for example, if a party transfers a vessel and $1 million in an exchange for another vessel which qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031(a) of the Code (relating to like-kind exchange), there is an acquisition to the extent of $1 million.

(ii) With respect to a lessee's interest in a vessel, expenditures which result in increasing the amounts with respect to which a deduction for depreciation (or amortization in lieu thereof) is allowable.
