A current list of Coast Guard accepted laboratories may be obtained from the following Web site:

(5) Three copies of a list prepared by the manufacturer that contains the name, model number, and function of each major component and accessory, such as the main control cabinet, remote annunciator cabinet, detector, zone card, isolator, central processing unit, zener barrier, special purpose module, or power supply.
