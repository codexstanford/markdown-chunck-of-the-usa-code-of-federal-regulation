####### United States Citizen Trust

(y)means:

(1) Subject to paragraph (3) of this definition, a trust that is qualified under this definition.

(2) A trust is qualified only if:

(i) Each of the trustees is a section 50501 citizen; and

(ii) The application for documentation of the vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121, includes the affidavit of each trustee stating that the trustee is not aware of any reason involving a beneficiary of the trust that is not a section 50501 citizen, or involving any other person that is not a section 50501 citizen, as a result of which the beneficiary or other person would hold more than 25 percent of the aggregate power to influence or limit the exercise of the authority of the trustee with respect to matters involving any ownership or operation of the vessel that may adversely affect the interests of the United States.

(3) If any person that is not a section 50501 citizen has authority to direct or participate in directing a trustee for a trust in matters involving any ownership or operation of the vessel that may adversely affect the interests of the United States or in removing a trustee for a trust without cause, either directly or indirectly through the control of another person, the trust instrument provides that persons who are not section 50501 citizens may not hold more than 25 percent of the aggregate authority to so direct or remove a trustee.

(4) This definition will not be considered to prohibit a person who is not a section 50501 citizen from holding more than 25 percent of the beneficial interest in a trust.
