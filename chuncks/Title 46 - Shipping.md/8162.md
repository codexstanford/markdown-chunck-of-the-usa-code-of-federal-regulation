####### Strength test #1.

(1)An assembled ladder is supported so that a static load, if placed on any of its steps, would exert a force both on the step and each suspension member. A static load of 315 kg (700 lb.) is then placed on one step for at least one minute. The load must be uniformly distributed over a contact surface that is approximately 100 mm (4 in.) wide. The center of the contact surface must be at the center of the step. This test is performed on six different steps. No step may break, crack, or incur any deformation that remains after the static load is removed. No attachment between any step and a suspension member may loosen or break during this test.
