####### Potentially Dangerous Material,PDM

ormeans a material that does not fall into a particular hazard class but can present a danger when carried in bulk aboard a vessel. The dangers often result from the material's tendency to self-heat or cause oxygen depletion. Materials that present a potential danger due solely to their tendency to shift in the cargo hold are not PDMs. For international shipments prepared in accordance with the IMSBC Code (incorporated by reference, see ยง 148.8), equivalent terminology to PDM is Material Hazardous only in Bulk (MHB).
