###### § 162.050-35 Bilge alarm: Approval tests.
####### Test No. 5A Supply Voltage Variation Test.

(f)(1) The supply voltage to the bilge alarm is raised to 110 percent of its design supply voltage. The bilge alarm is fed with a mixture of Test Fluid B and water and the test fluid content of the mixture is increased until the bilge alarm actuates. The ppm display is recorded and a sample of the mixture causing actuation is taken.

(2) The supply voltage to the alarm is lowered to 90 percent of its design supply voltage. The bilge alarm is fed with a mixture of Test Fluid B and water and the test fluid content of the mixture is increased until the bilge alarm actuates. The ppm display is recorded and a sample of the mixture causing actuation is taken.

(3) Upon completion of the steps described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the supply voltage to the alarm is returned to its design value.

(4) The steps described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section are repeated varying each other power supply to the alarm in the manner prescribed in those steps for supply voltage.
