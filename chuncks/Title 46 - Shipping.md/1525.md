##### Subpart 30.30 - Interim Procedures for Evaluating Vessel Personnel Licensing and Certification Programs of Foreign Countries
###### ยง 30.30-1 Scope and purpose.

(a) This subpart contains procedures for evaluating vessel personnel licensing and certification programs of foreign countries. Evaluations are done for countries which license or certificate personnel serving on tank vessels that enter or operate in U.S. navigable waters and ports.

(b) The purpose of each evaluation is to determine whether a foreign licensing and certification program has standards that are comparable to or more stringent than U.S. standards.

(c) A determination that licensing and certification standards of a foreign country are not comparable to or more stringent than U.S. standards will subject tank vessels manned with officers licensed by that country to the prohibition in 46 U.S.C. 70021(a)(5) on operation with those officers in U.S. navigable waters and ports.
