###### § 162.050-27 Oil content meter: Approval tests.
####### Test No. 5 Contaminant Test.

(f)(1) The meter is fed with a 15 ppm mixture until a steady oil content reading is obtained and recorded.

(2) The meter is fed with a 15 ppm oil mixture of contaminated water consisting of not less than 270 ppm by weight of the clay mineral attapulgite, or similar contaminant that is stable in both fresh and salt water and 30 ppm by weight of iron oxides. The test contaminant should have a particle size distribution with about 30 percent of 10 microns or less and a maximum particle size of 100 microns. The oil content reading, when steady, is recorded.

(3) Each of the two contaminants will be mixed sequentially in the following manner: the mixing of attapulgite shall be for a period of not less than 15 minutes so that a homogeneous suspension is formed; then, iron oxides will be added for an additional period of not less than 10 minutes. The mixing process should maintain the contaminants in suspension throughout the test period.

(4) The test in paragraph (f)(2) of this section is repeated for 100 and 300 ppm oil mixtures in contaminated water.
