(ii) The operator, while still being able to steer and control the speed of the rescue boat, must be able to see the water-

(A) Over a 90 degree arc within 3 m (10 ft) of each side of the rescue boat;

(B) Over a 30 degree arc within 1 m (3 ft, 3 in) of each side of the rescue boat; and

(C) Within 0.5 m (1 ft, 8 in) of the entrances designated for recovering persons from the water.
