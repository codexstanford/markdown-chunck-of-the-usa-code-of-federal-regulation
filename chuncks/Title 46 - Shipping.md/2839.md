###### ยง 56.20-15 Valves employing resilient material.
####### Category B valves.

(3)The closed valve will not provide effective closure of the line or will permit appreciable leakage from the valve after the resilient material is damaged or destroyed. Category B valves are not required to be tested and may be used in any location except where a Category A or positive shutoff valve is required.

(c) If a valve designer elects to use either a calculation or actual fire testing instead of material removal and pressure testing, the calculation must employ ISA-S75.02 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) to determine the flow coefficient (C), or the fire testing must be conducted in accordance with API 607 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
