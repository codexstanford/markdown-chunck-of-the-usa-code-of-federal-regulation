###### Hull Structure.

(3)(a) No structural changes will be required unless manifestly unsafe conditions exist.

(b) Existing uncertificated units must be drydocked or have a special examination in lieu of drydocking as required by 46 CFR, 107-261.

(c) Achievement of one compartment subdivision is not required where extensive modification of the original design would be necessary; however, watertight integrity of the hull and structural boundaries must be maintained. Bulkheads and decks designed to be watertight must be maintained as such where they are penetrated by pipes, electrical cable, reach rods, ventilation systems, etc.
