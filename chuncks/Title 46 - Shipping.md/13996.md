###### Where the desired results from competitive bidding cannot be obtained.

(1)For example, where there is doubt as to the reality of competition or the fairness or reasonableness of a low bid, all bids shall be rejected. If the ship's availability permits a new Invitation for Bids for the work in question shall be issued. If the bids received as a result of the second invitation are not considered satisfactory the bids are to be again rejected and prices of all specification items are to be negotiated with and the job awarded to the lowest bidder. If the low bidder refuses to accept the award upon the condition referred to the offer of award subject to price negotiation may be made to the next lowest bidder, etc. Negotiated awards in such cases shall be made in accordance with the conditions set forth on the invitation form, e.g., time specified, liquidated damages, etc. If a satisfactory price cannot be secured by negotiation with the bidders as herein proved an award may be made upon a negotiated basis approved in section 5 of this order.
