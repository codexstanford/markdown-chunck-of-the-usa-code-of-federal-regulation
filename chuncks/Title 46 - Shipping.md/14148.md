####### Lender Syndicate

(n)means an arrangement established for the combined extension of credit of not less than $20,000,000 made up of four or more entities that each have a beneficial interest, held through an agent, under a trust arrangement established pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31322(f). Other than the exercise by the agent of powers related to routine administrative matters, none of the entities in a Lender Syndicate may exercise powers related to the Lender Syndicate's extension of credit without the concurrence of at least one other unaffiliated beneficiary. Powers related to routine administrative matters include those concerning the day-to-day management of the extension of credit such as monitoring compliance with loan covenants, collateral inspections and similar matters; however, more substantive powers such as amending loan and mortgage documents, releasing guarantors or collateral, or administering the loan in the event of a default are not considered routine.
