###### Appendix B to Subpart C of Part 197-Substance Technical Guidelines, Benzene
####### Fire.

(a)(1) Flash point (closed cup): -11 &#xB0;C (12 &#xB0;F).

(2) Autoignition temperature: 580 &#xB0;C (1076 &#xB0;F).

(3) Flammable limits in air, % by volume: Lower: 1.3%, Upper: 7.5%.

(4) Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or foam.

(5) Special fire fighting procedures: Do not use a solid stream of water, because it will scatter and spread the fire. Fine water spray may be used to keep fire-exposed containers cool.

(6) Unusual fire and explosion hazards: Benzene is a flammable liquid. Its vapors can form explosive mixtures. All ignition sources must be controlled when benzene is used, handled, or stored. Areas where liquid or vapor may be released are considered hazardous locations. Benzene vapors are heavier than air. Thus, benzene vapors may travel along the deck and ground and be ignited by open flames or sparks at locations remote from the site at which benzene is handled.

(7) Benzene is classified as a flammable liquid for the purpose of conforming to the requirements of 49 CFR 172.101 concerning the designation of materials as hazardous materials. Locations where benzene may be present in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitable mixtures are considered Class I Group D locations for the purposes of conforming to the requirements of 46 CFR parts 30 through 40, 151, and 153 when determining the requirements for electrical equipment as specified in Subchapter J (Electrical engineering).
