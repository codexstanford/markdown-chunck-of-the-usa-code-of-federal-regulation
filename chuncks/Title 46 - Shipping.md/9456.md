###### § 160.156-15 Production inspections, tests, quality control, and conformance of rescue boats and fast rescue boats.
####### In-process inspections and tests.

(1)Each production rescue boat must be examined during lay-up of the hull to verify that the lay-up conforms to the approved drawings. Each FRP major component, such as the hull, canopy, and inner liner, must be examined and weighed after it is completed but before assembled. If the rescue boat is constructed by the spray lay-up technique, the hull and canopy thicknesses must be measured using ultrasonic or equivalent techniques. Laboratory tests of laminates must be conducted at this time. Test samples must be cut out from the rescue boat itself or be laid up at the same time, using the same procedures, and by the same operators as the laminate used in the rescue boat. The number of samples used for each test, and the conditions and test methods used, must be as described in the applicable test specified in this paragraph.
