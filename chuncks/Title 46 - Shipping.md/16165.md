##### § 560.1 Purpose; general provisions.

(a)(1) It is the purpose of this part to enumerate certain conditions resulting from the action of a common carrier, acting alone or in concert with any person, or a foreign government, which unduly impair the access of a vessel documented under the laws of the United States whether liner, bulk, tramp or other vessel, (hereinafter "U.S. flag vessel") to ocean trade between foreign ports, which includes intermodal movements, and to establish procedures by which the owner or operator of a U.S. flag vessel (hereinafter "U.S. flag carrier") may petition the Federal Maritime Commission for relief under the authority of section 13(b)(6)of the Shipping Act of 1984 ("the Act") (46 U.S.C. 41108(d)).

(2) It is the further purpose of this part to indicate the general circumstances under which the authority granted to the Commission under section 13(b)(6) (46 U.S.C. 41108(d)) may be invoked, and the nature of the subsequent actions contemplated by the Commission.

(3) This part also furthers the goals of the Act with respect to encouraging the development of an economically sound and efficient U.S. flag liner fleet as stated in section 2 of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40101).

(b)(1) This part implements the statutory notice and hearing requirement and ensures that due process is afforded to all affected parties. At the same time, it allows for flexibility in structuring proceedings so that the Commission may act expeditiously whenever harm to a U.S. flag carrier resulting from impaired access to cross trades has been demonstrated or is imminent.
