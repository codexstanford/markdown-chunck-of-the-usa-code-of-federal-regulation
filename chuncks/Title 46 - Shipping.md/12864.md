(ii) Sufficient records shall be maintained to fully describe and account for all aspects of each item reported in this account, and when a firm commitment is made to dispose of an operating business segment, a provision for anticipated gain or loss to be realized in the subsequent period from disposal of assets and winding down of operations of the discontinued segment shall be taken into income in the year the contractor makes the decision.

(iii) Amounts in this account must be net of all taxes including Federal income taxes.
