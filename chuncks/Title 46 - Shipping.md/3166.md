####### Testing.

(c)(1) Prior to installation, tanks vented to atmosphere shall be tested to, and must withstand, a pressure of 5 pounds per square inch or 1times the maximum head to which they may be subjected in service, whichever is greater. A standpipe of 11feet in height attached to the tank may be filled with water to accomplish the 5 pounds per square inch test. Permanent deformation of the tank will not be cause for rejection unless accompanied by leakage.

(2) After installation of the fuel tank on a vessel the complete installation shall be tested in the presence of a marine inspector to a head not less than that to which the tank may be subjected in service. Fuel may be used as a testing medium.

(3) All tanks not vented to atmosphere shall be constructed and tested in accordance with part 54 of this subchapter.
