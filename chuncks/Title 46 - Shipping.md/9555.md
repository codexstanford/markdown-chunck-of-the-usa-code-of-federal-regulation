####### Water and air penetration.

(10)Each subject is weighed while wearing a pre-wetted suit without any auxiliary means of buoyancy. The subject jumps into water from a height that will cause the subject to be completely immersed. The subject swims or treads water for approximately one minute, emerges from the water, and is weighed within 10 seconds after emerging. The procedure is repeated with the subject entering the water headfirst. If air accumulates in the legs as the subject enters the water head-first, it must be expelled automatically. At the end of this test, the weight of the subject in the suit must not exceed the weight of the subject in the suit at the beginning of the test by more than 500 grams. Each test subject then re-enters the water and floats for a period of one hour. The subject then emerges from the water and is weighed within 10 seconds. The weight of the subject in the suit at the end of this test must not exceed the weight of the subject in the suit at the beginning of the period of flotation by more than 200 grams.
