###### § 164.009-19 Measurement of moisture and volatile matter content.

(a) The measurements described in this section are made to determine the moisture and volatile matter content of a sample.

(b) A specimen cut from the density specimen of a sample is conditioned for at least one week, and for any additional time needed for the specimen to reach a constant weight, in an atmosphere that is 22.8 &#xB0;C. +/-2 &#xB0;C., and 50 percent +/-5 percent relative humidity. The conditioned specimen is then weighed and transferred to a previously weighed wide mouth weighing bottle that has a glass stopper. With the stopper removed, the bottle, stopper, and specimen are heated at 105 &#xB0;C. +/-5 &#xB0;C. for four hours. After four hours, the stopper is inserted in the bottle and the bottle and sample are cooled and weighed.

(c) The content of moisture and volatile matter is the difference between the two weighings and is reported as a percentage of the weight of the conditioned specimen.
