(a) Safety relief valves shall be so constructed that no shocks detrimental to the valve or pressure vessel are produced when lifting or closing. Safety relief valves shall be designed to open sharply and reach full lift and capacity at the maximum accumulation. Valve closure after popping shall be clean and sharp. Safety relief valves shall operate satisfactorily without wiredrawing and chattering at any stage of operation.

(b) Safety relief valves having adjustable blow-down construction shall be adjusted to close after blowing down not more than 5 percent of the set pressure. Valves shall be adjusted to pop within a tolerance of plus or minus 3 percent of the set pressure, except that for pressures of 70 p.s.i. and below, the tolerance in popping pressure shall not vary more than plus or minus 2 p.s.i.
