##### ยง 388.4 Criteria for grant of a waiver.
###### General Criteria.

(a)(1) A waiver of the foreign build and/or foreign rebuild prohibition in the coastwise trade laws will be granted for an eligible vessel only if we determine that the employment of the vessel in the coastwise trade will not unduly adversely affect-

(i) United States vessel builders; or

(ii) The coastwise trade business of any person who employs vessels built in the United States in that business.

(2) The determination of "unduly adverse affect" on a coastwise operator or a U.S. vessel builder may not be limited to operators or builders of vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers.

(3) We may evaluate the expected impact of the proposed waiver on the basis of the information received from all sources, including public comment, internal investigation and analysis, and any other sources of information deemed appropriate.
