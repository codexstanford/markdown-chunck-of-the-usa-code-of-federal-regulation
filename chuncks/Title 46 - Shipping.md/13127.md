(g)If only partial funding is appropriated by the 60th day of the fiscal year, then the Secretary, in consultation with SecDef, will select the vessels to retain under TSP Operating Agreements, based on the Secretaries' determinations of the most militarily useful and commercially viable vessels. If no funds are appropriated by the 60th day of such fiscal year, and notwithstanding any other provision, then all TSP Operating Agreements will be terminated, and each Agreement Holder will be released from its obligations under the TSP Operating Agreement. Final payments under the terminated TSP Operating Agreements will be made in accordance with ยง 294.31. To the extent that funds are appropriated in a subsequent fiscal year, former TSP Operating Agreements may be reinstated if mutually acceptable to the Administrator and the Agreement Holder, provided the TSP vessel remains eligible.
