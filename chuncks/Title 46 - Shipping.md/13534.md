####### Public accountant's report.

(g)The annual report will be accompanied by the public accountant's report based on an audit of the company's financial statements. We may require an audit by the public accountants of the financial statements contained in the company's semiannual report. We also may require certification of the semiannual report by the accountants. Where independent certification is not required, a responsible corporate officer will attach a certification that such report is based on the accounting records and, to the best of that officer's knowledge and belief, is accurate and complete.
