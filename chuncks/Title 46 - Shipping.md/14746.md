The report shall include the availability of Canadian Registered Pilots who are assigned to that pool for administrative purposes. The report shall list the name of each pilot and show his or her availability status for each day of the month as: available, unavailable due to illness or injury, unavailable with advance notice for personal reasons, unavailability authorized by the pool for business reasons, unavailable without advance notice or unaccounted for, unavailable for disciplinary reasons. The report shall be maintained on a daily basis by an officer or employee of the pool, who shall be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the report.
