###### ยง 32.50-20 Cargo piping for tank vessels constructed between November 10, 1936, and July 1, 1951 - TB/ALL.

(a) On tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started on or after November 10, 1936, and prior to July 1, 1951, the piping shall be arranged so as to avoid excessive stresses at the joints. For sizes exceeding 2 inches in diameter, flanged, welded, or other approved types of joints shall be employed. Packing material shall be suitable for the cargo carried. Connections at bulkheads shall be made so that the plating does not form part of a flanged joint. Piping may be carried through bunker spaces and deep tanks provided it is run through a pipe tunnel. The tunnel may be omitted where the pipe is extra heavy, all joints are welded, and bends are installed to provide for expansion and contraction.
