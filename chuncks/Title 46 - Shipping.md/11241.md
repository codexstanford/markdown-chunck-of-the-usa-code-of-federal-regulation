#### PART 174-SPECIAL RULES PERTAINING TO SPECIFIC VESSEL TYPES
##### Subpart H-Special Rules Pertaining to Liftboats
###### § 174.255 Restricted service.
####### Intact stability.

(a)(1) Each liftboat must be shown by design calculations to meet, under each condition of loading and operation afloat, the following requirements:

(i) Those imposed by § 174.045, given a "K" value of at least 1.4.

(ii) A range of positive stability of at least 10 degrees extending from the angle of the first intercept of the curves of righting moment and wind heeling moment, either to the angle of the second intercept of those curves or to the angle of heel at which downflooding would occur, whichever angle is less.

(iii) A residual righting energy of at least 0.003 meter radians (5 foot-degrees) between the angle of the first intercept of the curves of righting moment and wind heeling moment, either to the angle of the second intercept of those curves or to the angle of heel at which downflooding would occur, whichever angle is less.

(2) For this section, each wind heeling moment must be calculated as prescribed by § 174.055 of this part using winds of 60 knots for normal conditions of operation afloat and of 70 knots for severe-storm conditions of operation afloat.

(3) For paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the initial metacentric height must be at least 300 millimeters (1 foot) for each leg position encountered while afloat including the full range of leg positions encountered while jacking.
