####### ยง 308.512 Declaration of shipments under Open Cargo Policy.
######## Definition of inward and outward shipments.

(d)A shipment will be classified as an inward shipment or as an outward shipment by reference to the geographical location of the assured with respect to the movement of the shipment. The address of the assured as stated in the application filed by him for the policy shall be deemed to be the assured's geographical location for the purpose of determining whether the shipment is inward or outward. To illustrate, if an assured has stated in his application that his address is in Hawaii, the assured's shipments of goods from the United States to Hawaii would be classified as inward, and his shipments from Hawaii to the United States would be classified as outward. Any shipments that cannot be classified as inward or outward under this definition shall be treated as inward shipments for the purposes of the declaration.
