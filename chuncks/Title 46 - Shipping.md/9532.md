####### Thermal protection.

(c)The suit must be designed to protect against loss of body heat as follows:

(1) The thermal conductivity of the suit material when submerged 1 m (39 in.) in water must be less than or equal to that of a control sample of 4.75 mm (in.) thick, closed-cell neoprene foam. The control sample of foam must have a thermal conductivity of not more than 0.055 watt/meter-&#xB0; K (0.38 Btu-in./hr.-sq.ft.- &#xB0;F).

(2) The suit must provide the wearer with sufficient thermal insulation, following one jump into the water from a height of 4.5 m, to ensure that the wearer's body core temperature does not fall more than 2 &#xB0;C (3.6 &#xB0;F) after a period of 6 hours immersion in calm circulating water at a temperature of between 0 &#xB0;C (32 &#xB0;F) and 2 &#xB0;C (35.6 &#xB0;F).
