(b)(1) Cargo tanks in which Grade A liquids are to be transported shall be fitted with a venting system consisting of branch vent line from each cargo tank connected to a vent header which shall extend to a reasonable height above the weather deck and be fitted with a flame arrester or pressure-vacuum relief valve. Each branch vent line may be provided with a manually operated control valve, provided it is bypassed with a pressure-vacuum relief valve or each cargo tank to which such a branch vent line is connected is fitted with an independent pressure-vacuum relief valve. The vent header system shall be provided with suitable connections for flushing and draining.

(2) In barges with independent tanks carrying Grade A liquids, separate discharge pipes may be fitted to each pressure-vacuum relief valve, or the pressure-vacuum relief valve may be elevated, so that in either case the discharge from such valve will not be less than 7 feet above the deck where practicable.
