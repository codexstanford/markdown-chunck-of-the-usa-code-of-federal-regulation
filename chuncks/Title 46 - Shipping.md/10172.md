###### § 164.008-3 Testing procedure.
####### Preparation of test specimen.

(b)(1) The test specimens shall be conditioned to approximately constant weight with the air being maintained at a relative humidity of 40 to 70 percent and a temperature of 15&#xB0; to 25 &#xB0;C. (59&#xB0; to 77 &#xB0;F.). After conditioning, but before testing, the temperature of the specimen should not exceed 40 &#xB0;C. (104 &#xB0;F.).

(2) The specimens shall be mounted in the furnace in a vertical position in such a way as to give an exposed surface of at least 4.65 square meters (50 square feet) and a height of at least 2.44 meters (8 feet).

(3) The specimen shall be supported at the top and secured on the vertical sides and at the bottom in a manner representative of conditions in service. If provision for movement at the edges of a bulkhead panel is made for a particular construction in service, the specimen should stimulate these conditions.

(4) The method of securing shall be such that there is no possibility of misinterpretation of test results due to the passage of flame at the edges of the specimen when the method of fixing is not the subject of the test.
