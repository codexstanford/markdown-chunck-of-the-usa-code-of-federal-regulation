(a)(1) For machinery spaces and pumprooms, the system shall be so designed and arranged as to spread a blanket of foam over the entire tank top or bilge of the space protected. The arrangement of piping shall be such as to give a relatively uniform distribution over the entire area protected.

(2) Where an installation is made to protect an oil-fired boiler installation on a flat which is open to or can drain to the lower engineroom or other space, both the flat and the lower space shall be protected simultaneously. The flat shall be fitted with suitable coamings on all openings other than deck drains to properly restrain the oil and foam at that level.
