####### Overall depth

means the vertical distance taken at or near midships from a line drawn horizontally through the uppermost edges of the skin (outside planking or plating) at the sides of the hull (excluding the cap rail, trunks, cabins, and deckhouses) to the outboard face of the bottom skin of the hull, excluding the keel. For a vessel that is designed for sailing and has a keel faired to the hull, the keel is included in "overall depth" if the distance to the bottom skin of the hull cannot be determined reasonably.
