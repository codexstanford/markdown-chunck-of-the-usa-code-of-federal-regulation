####### Test procedure.

(3)A physician must always be present during this test. Before donning the suit, each subject rests quietly in a room with a temperature between 10 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) and 25 &#xB0;C (77 &#xB0;F) for 15 minutes. The rectal temperature is then recorded as the initial rectal temperature. The subject dons a suit as rapidly as possible without damaging the instrumentation and immediately enters the water. The subject assumes a face-up, stable floating position. No auxiliary means of buoyancy may be used during this test. The subject remains in the water engaging in activity that maintains the heart rate between 50 and 140 per minute for the first hour, and between 50 and 120 per minute during the remainder of the test, except that no attempt is made to control heart rate if the subject is shivering. Each thermistor or thermocouple reading is recorded at least every 10 minutes.
