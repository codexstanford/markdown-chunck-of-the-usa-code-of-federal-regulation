(d)Where a vessel is subject to a mortgage or other encumbrance at the time of its sale or loss and the taxpayer actually receives only an amount representing the equity therein or a share in such equity corresponding to his share in the vessel, he shall deposit in the construction reserve fund such amount and concurrently therewith other funds in an amount equal to the difference between the amount received and the "net proceeds" or "net indemnity".
