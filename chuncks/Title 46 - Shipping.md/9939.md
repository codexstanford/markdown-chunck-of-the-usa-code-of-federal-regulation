###### § 162.050-27 Oil content meter: Approval tests.
####### Test No. 9 Sample Pressure or Flow Test.

(j)(1) The steps described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section are repeated.

(2) If the meter has a positive displacement mixture pump, the mixture pressure is lowered to one-half of the meter's maximum design pressure. If the meter has a centrifugal mixture pump, or is not equipped with a mixture pump, the mixture flow rate is reduced to one-half of the meter's design flow rate. The reduced flow rate or mixture pressure is maintained until a steady oil content reading is obtained and recorded.

(3) If the meter has a positive displacement mixture pump, the mixture pressure is increased to twice the meter's design pressure. If the meter has a centrifugal mixture pump or does not have a mixture pump, the mixture flow rate is increased to twice the meter's maximum design flow rate. The increased flow rate or mixture pressure is maintained until a steady oil content reading is obtained and recorded.
