###### Qualified withdrawals paid to related persons.

(4)A withdrawal, including payments for indebtedness, paid to a related person, within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder, shall not constitute a qualified withdrawal unless the Maritime Administrator determines that no portion of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital or a contribution of capital under the Internal Revenue Code. Transactions which include payments to a related person, will be approved if the cost of the item to be acquired, constructed or reconstructed through qualified withdrawals is or was at the time of the acquisition, construction or reconstruction its fair market value. The party must obtain the prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator before any qualified withdrawals may be paid to a related person. Any such withdrawal prior to approval shall be a nonqualified withdrawal.
