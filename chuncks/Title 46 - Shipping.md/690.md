####### Disenrollment.

(h)(1) A Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization must give each client organization it serves a 180-day notice of its intention to cease to function as a Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization.

(2) If the Coast Guard determines that a Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization is not meeting its obligations to review, accept, and monitor training and assessment, the NMC will notify the organization in writing and will enclose information about the events that led to this determination. The organization will then have a specified period of time to correct the deficiency or appeal the conclusions to the Commandant (CG-5P). If the organization appeals, and the appeal is denied, or the deficiencies are not corrected within the allotted time, the NMC will withdraw the acceptance of the Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization. The NMC will notify all client organizations affected by this decision so that they may make arrangements to transfer to another Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization or seek NMC approval for their training.

(i) A Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization may not approve courses provided by subsidiary organizations.
