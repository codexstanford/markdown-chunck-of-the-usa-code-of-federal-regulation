####### Working Capital.

(i)The Company's Working Capital shall not be less than one dollar. This Working Capital requirement is based on the premise that the Company engages in a service-type activity with only normal vessel inventory. If Working Capital includes other inventory, in addition to such normal Vessel inventory, we may adjust the requirement as appropriate. Also, if we determine that the Company's Working Capital includes amounts receivable that it reasonably could not expect to collect within one year, we may make adjustments to the Working Capital requirements.
