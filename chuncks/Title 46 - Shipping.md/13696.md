####### Formula.

(a)In cases where the owner and the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime Administration, have agreed, in advance of the loss, upon amounts representing, or the method for determining, the average daily consumption costs of stores and supplies for the owner's vessel, claims for total loss of such stores and supplies may be submitted by the owner on Affidavit in Proof of Claim for the loss of stores and supplies, Exhibit A. In such cases, the value of the consumable stores at time of loss is determined as follows:

(1) The value of consumable stores on board at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the number of days for which the vessel is stored by the average daily consumption cost in dollars, plus

(2) The cost of consumable stores, if any, purchased in foreign ports for the homeward voyage, less

(3) The average daily consumption cost times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus the actual amount of consumable stores transferred or sold. The values of slop chest stores, bar stock and fuel, at the time of loss are determined in the same manner by using the applicable daily consumption costs for such stores. The value of subsistence stores at the time of loss is determined as follows:

(i) The value of subsistence stores on board at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the agreed cost for one man per day by the number of crew signed on and the number of passengers, if any, and multiplying that product by the number of days for which the vessel is stored, plus

(ii) The cost of subsistence stores, if any, purchased in foreign ports for the homeward voyage, less

(iii) The number of crew signed on and the average number of passengers, if any, times the agreed cost of one man per day times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus the actual amount of subsistence stores transferred or sold.
