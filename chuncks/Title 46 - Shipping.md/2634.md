###### ยง 52.01-55 Increase in maximum allowable working pressure.

(a) When the maximum allowable working pressure of a boiler has been established, an increase in the pressure settings of its safety valves shall not be granted unless the boiler design meets the requirements of this subchapter in effect at the time the boiler was contracted for or built; but in no case will a pressure increase be authorized for boilers constructed prior to the effective date of the regulations dated November 19, 1952, if the minimum thickness found by measurement shows that the boiler will have a factor of safety of less than 4. The piping system, machinery, and appurtenances shall meet the present requirements of this subchapter for the maximum allowable working pressure requested. An increase in pressure shall be granted only by the Commandant upon presentation of data or plans proving that the requested increase in pressure is justified.

(b) When an existing boiler is replaced by a new boiler designed to operate at pressures in excess of the pressure indicated on the certificate of inspection for the previous boiler, an analysis of the complete system shall be made, including machinery and piping, to insure its compatibility with the increased steam pressure. The maximum allowable working pressure on the certificate of inspection shall be based on the results of this analysis.
