###### § 162.050-27 Oil content meter: Approval tests.
####### Test No. 3 Response Time Test.

(d)(1) The meter is fed with water, zeroed, and then fed with a 100 ppm mixture. The time at which the meter first detects oil in the mixture, the times of reading 63 ppm and 90 ppm, and the time of reaching the highest steady reading of oil content are recorded. The oil content of the mixture at the highest steady reading is also recorded.

(2) The metering pump is turned off and the time at which the highest reading starts to decrease, the times of reading 37 ppm and 10 ppm, and the time of returning to the lowest steady oil content reading are recorded. The oil content of the mixture at the lowest steady reading is also recorded.

(3) The time interval between first detecting oil in the mixture and reading 63 ppm, and the time interval between the first decrease in the highest reading and reading 37 ppm, are averaged and recorded as the response time for the meter.
