(ii) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, the rate for such year as determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and the Secretary of Transportation. Such rate shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970. The determination of the applicable rate for any such taxable year will be computed by multiplying 8 percent by the ratio which () the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of such taxable year, bears to () the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable rate so determined shall be computed to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent. If such a determination and publication is made, the latest published percentage shall apply for any taxable year beginning in the calendar year with respect to which publication is made.

(3) No interest shall be payable in respect of taxes on amounts referred to in section 607(h)(2) (i) and (ii) of the Act (relating to withdrawals for research and development and payments against indebtedness in excess of basis) or in the case of any nonqualified withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as in effect on December 31, 1969.
