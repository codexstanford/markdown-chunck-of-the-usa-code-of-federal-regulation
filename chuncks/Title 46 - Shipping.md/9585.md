####### Abrasion resistance.

(o)The abrasion resistance of each type of suit material on the exterior of the suit must be determined by the method described in Federal Test Method Standard 191, Method 5304.1. If varying thicknesses of exterior suit material are used, samples representing the thinnest portion of the material must be tested. If exterior material has multiple layers, samples of the layer on the outside surface of the suit must be tested. Any exterior material which is a composite formed of two or more layers bonded together is considered to be a single material and the abradant must be applied to the surface that is on the exterior of the suit. The residual breaking strength of each material must be at least 225 Newtons (50 lb.).
