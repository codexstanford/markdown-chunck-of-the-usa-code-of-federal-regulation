####### Brazing, general.

(c)(1) Heat shall be applied evenly and uniformly to all parts of the joint in order to prevent local overheating.

(2) The members to be joined shall be held firmly in place until the brazing alloy has set so as to prevent any strain on the joint until the brazing alloy has thoroughly solidified. The brazing shall be done by placing the flux and brazing material on one side of the joint and applying heat until the brazing material flows entirely through the lap and shows uniformly along the seam on the other side of the joint. Sufficient flux shall be used to cause the brazing material to appear promptly after reaching the brazing temperature.
