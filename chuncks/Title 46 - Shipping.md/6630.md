###### ยง 136.240 Permit to proceed.
####### What another vessel must do before proceeding to another port for repairs.

(b)If a vessel does not have a TSMS, or a vessel has one but it does not address the condition of the vessel that has resulted in non-compliance or the necessary conditions under which the vessel may safely proceed to another port for repair, the owner, managing operator, or master must request permission to proceed from the cognizant OCMI in whose zone the non-compliance occurs or is discovered. This permission operates as follows:

(1) The request for permission to proceed may be made electronically, in writing, or orally. The cognizant OCMI may require a written description, a damage survey, or other documentation to assist in determining the nature and seriousness of the non-compliance.

(2) The vessel will not engage in towing, unless the cognizant OCMI determines it is safe to do so.

(3) The Coast Guard may issue the permit either on Form CG-948, "Permit to Proceed to Another Port for Repairs," or in letter form, and will state the conditions under which the vessel may proceed to another port for repair.
