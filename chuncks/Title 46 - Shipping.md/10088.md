####### Level wind suspension cable.

(11)If the hoist has suspension cables, it is installed in a level operating position with the cables wound onto the drums. A weight equal to the working load is attached to the hoist. The cables are run all the way out and then rewound back onto the drums at least ten times. Each drum and cable is observed for level winding as the cable is wound onto the drum. The test must be repeated with a weight equal to the weight of the rigid ladder or lift platform. In each test, each cable must always rewind onto the drum in one level wind of wrap.
