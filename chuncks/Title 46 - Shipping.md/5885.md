####### Main vertical zones.

(d)(1) The hull, superstructure, and deck houses of a vessel, except for a vehicle space on a vehicle ferry, must be subdivided by bulkheads into main vertical zones which:

(i) Are generally not more than 40 meters (131 feet) in mean length on any one deck;

(ii) Must be constructed to:

(A) The greater of A-30 Class or the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, or;

(B) Minimum A-0 Class where there is a Type 8, 12 or 13 space on either side of the division; and

(iii) May have small horizontal steps, if the steps:

(A) Do not exceed 20% of the mean length of the main vertical zone or 8 meters (26 feet), whichever is smaller; and

(B) Must be constructed to A-60 Class, or minimum A-0 Class where there is a Type 8, 12 or 13 space on either side of the division.

(iv) May be extended to a maximum mean length of 44 meters (144 feet) on each deck by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center provided the maximum distance between the furthermost points of the bulkheads bounding the main vertical zone also does not exceed 44 meters (144 feet).

(2) Vehicle decks on a vehicle ferry must be subdivided. Where main vertical zones are impractical due to the vehicle carrying configuration, main horizontal zones may be provided. The decks bounding such a zone must be of at least A-30 construction or meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, whichever is greater.
