####### Methods for measuring exempt spaces.

(g)(1) If the exempt space is located within the superstructure, the exempt space is measured using the same procedures used to measure superstructure tonnage under ยง 69.113.

(2) If the exempt space is located between-deck, the space is measured using the same procedures used for between-deck tonnage under ยง 69.111(c), except that the length of the exempt space is divided into the even number of spaces most equal to the number of spaces into which the between-deck was divided.

(3) If the exempt space is located under-deck, the space is measured using the same procedures used for under-deck tonnage under ยง 69.109, except that the length of the exempt space is divided into the even number of spaces most equal to the number of spaces into which the under-deck was divided, and the zone of influence method must be applied if the ordinary frames upon which the under-deck breadth measurements are based do not have the same depth of frame.
