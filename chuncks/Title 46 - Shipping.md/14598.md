###### Effect of nonqualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to election.

(4)If property deposited into a fund with respect to which an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made, is withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in § 391.7(b)), no gain or loss is to be recognized by the party with respect to fund property or nonfund property but an amount equal to the adjusted basis of the property to the fund is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. Thus, such amount is to be applied against the various accounts in the manner provided in § 391.7(c), such amount is to be taken into account in computing the party's taxable income as provided in § 391.7(d), and such amount is to be subject to interest to the extent provided for in § 391.7(e). In the case of withdrawals to which this subparagraph applies, the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is the adjusted basis on the date of deposit, increased or decreased by the adjustments made to such property while held in the fund, and in determining the period for which the party has held the property there shall be included, in addition to the period the fund held the property, the period for which the party held the property before the date of deposit of the property into the fund. For rules relating to the basis and holding period of property purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section as purchased by the fund) and withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal see § 391.7(f).
