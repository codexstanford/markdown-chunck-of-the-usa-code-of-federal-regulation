#### PART 162-ENGINEERING EQUIPMENT
##### Subpart 162.060-Ballast Water Management Systems
###### § 162.060-42 Responsibilities for Independent Laboratories (ILs).

(a) Upon receipt of a request from a manufacturer for approval testing of a ballast water management system (BWMS), the independent laboratory will conduct a readiness evaluation and determine the acceptability of the BWMS for testing.

(1) The readiness evaluation will examine the design and construction of the BWMS to determine whether there are any fundamental problems that might constrain the ability of the BWMS to manage ballast water as proposed by the manufacturer or to operate it safely onboard vessels. This evaluation must determine that the BWMS-

(i) Is designed and constructed according to the requirements of § 162.060-20 of this subpart;

(ii) Meets all existing safety and environmental regulatory requirements for all locations and conditions where the system will be operated during the testing and evaluation period; and

(iii) Meets the definition of a complete BWMS, as defined in this subpart, to include both ballast water treatment equipment and control and monitoring equipment. Only complete systems in the configurations in which they are intended for sale and use will be accepted for type-approval testing.

(2) The independent laboratory has the right to reject a proposed BWMS for type-approval testing if it does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is not deemed ready for approval testing or if, for technical or logistical reasons, that independent laboratory does not have the capability to accommodate the BWMS for testing or evaluation.
