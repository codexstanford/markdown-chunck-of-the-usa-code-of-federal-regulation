###### § 188.10-35 International voyage.
####### i.e.,International voyage

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the term "international voyage" as used in this subchapter shall have the same meaning as that contained in Regulation 2(d), Chapter I of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974,,means a voyage from a country to which the present convention applies to a port outside such country, or conversely."

(c) The International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, does not apply to vessels "solely navigating the Great Lakes of North America and the River St. Lawrence as far east as a straight line drawn from Cap de Rosiers to West Point, Anticosti Island and, on the north side of Anticosti Island, the 63d Meridian." Accordingly, such vessels shall not be considered as being on an "international voyage" for the purpose of this subchapter.

(d) In addition, although voyages between the continental United States and Hawaii or Alaska, and voyages between Hawaii and Alaska are not "international voyages" under the provisions of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, such voyages are similar in nature and shall be considered as "international voyages" for the purposes of this subchapter.
