####### Fuses and circuitbreakers.

(c)If the allowable current-carrying capacity of the conductor does not correspond to a standard rating for fuses or circuitbreakers that meets Section 240.6 of NFPA NEC 2002 or IEC 60092-202 (both incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1), then the next larger such rating is acceptable, except that:

(1) This rating must not be larger than 150 percent of the current-carrying capacity of the conductor; and

(2) The effect of temperature on the operation of fuses and thermally controlled circuitbreakers must be taken into consideration.
