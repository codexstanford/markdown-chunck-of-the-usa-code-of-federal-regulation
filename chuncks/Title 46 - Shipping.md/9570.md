####### Test procedure.

(2)The basket is submerged so that its top edge is 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the water. The basket is then weighed. Thereafter, a suit is submerged in water and then filled with water, folded, and placed in the submerged basket. The basket is titled 45&#xB0; from the vertical for five minutes in each of four different directions to allow all entrapped air to escape. The basket is then suspended with its top edge 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the water for 24 hours. At the beginning and end of this period, the basket and suit are weighed underwater. The measured buoyancy of the suit is the difference between this weight and the weight of the basket as determined at the beginning of the test. The measured buoyancy after 24 hours must not be more than 5% lower than the initial measured buoyancy. The measured buoyancy after 24 hours is used to determine adjusted buoyancy as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
