(1) The total volume of the pockets must be not less than 25 percent of the minimum required volume of the principal buoyancy compartments of the liferaft.

(2) The pockets must be securely attached and evenly distributed around the periphery of the exterior bottom of the liferaft. They may be omitted at the locations of inflation cylinders.
