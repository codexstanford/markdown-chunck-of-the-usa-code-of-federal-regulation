(a) Nonmetallic expansion joints must be examined externally at each inspection for certification and periodic inspection for signs of excessive wear, fatigue, deterioration, physical damage, misalignment, improper flange-to-flange spacing, and leakage. A complete internal examination must be conducted when an external examination reveals excessive wear or other signs of deterioration or damage.

(b) A nonmetallic expansion joint must be replaced 10 years after it has been placed into service if it is located in a system which penetrates the side of the vessel and both the penetration and the nonmetallic expansion joint are located below the deepest load waterline. The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection may grant an extension of the ten year replacement to coincide with the vessel's next drydocking.
