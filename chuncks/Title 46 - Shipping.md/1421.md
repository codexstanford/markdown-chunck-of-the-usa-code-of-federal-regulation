####### Extent and character of damage.

(d)Except where a lesser extent of damage or a smaller penetration would be more disabling, in evaluating the damage stability of a vessel the following penetration must be assumed:

(1) Longitudinal extent-L/10, or 10 feet (3.05 meters) plus 0.03L, whichever is less. Transverse watertight bulkheads that are separated by at least this distance may be assumed to remain effective;

(2) Transverse extent-30 inches (0.76 meters) from the side measured at right angles to the centerline at the level of the deepest operating waterline; and

(3) Vertical extent-from the baseline upward without limit.

(e) Each space containing a through hull fitting, such as the lazarette and the engineroom, must be assumed to be flooded.
