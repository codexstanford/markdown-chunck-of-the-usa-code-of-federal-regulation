####### Spot check tests.

(e)(1) Deck coverings are not inspected at regularly scheduled factory inspections; however, the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may detail a marine inspector at any time to visit any place where deck coverings are manufactured to conduct any inspections or examinations deemed advisable and to select representative samples for further examination, inspection or tests. The marine inspector shall be admitted to any place where work is done on deck coverings or component materials.

(2) Manufacturers of approved deck coverings shall maintain quality control of materials used, manufacturing methods, and the finished product so as to meet the requirements of this specification, and any other conditions outlined on the certificate of approval, but the Coast Guard also reserves the right to make spot-check tests of approved deck coverings at any time on samples selected by a marine inspector at the place of manufacture or samples obtained from other sources in the field. The manufacturer will incur no expense for such tests, but the results shall be binding upon the approval of his product. The manufacturer will be advised in advance of the time of testing of the samples selected and may witness the tests if he so desires.
