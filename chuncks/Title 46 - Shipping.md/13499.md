####### Termination date of the Escrow Fund.

(e)The Escrow Fund shall terminate 90 days after the delivery date of the last Vessel or Shipyard Project covered by the Security Agreement (the "Termination Date"). In the event that on such date the payment of the full amount of the aggregate Actual Cost of all of the Vessels or Shipyard Project has not been made or the amounts with respect to such Actual Cost are not then due and payable, then we and the Obligor by written agreement shall extend the Termination Date for such period as we and the Obligor shall determine is sufficient to allow for such contingencies. Any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund on the Termination Date which are in excess of 87percent or 75 percent of Actual Cost, as the case may be, shall be applied to retire a pro rata portion of the Obligations.
