###### § 532.5 Requirements for NVOCC negotiated rate arrangements.
####### Surcharges, assessorial charges, and GRIs.

(2)(i) If the rate is not an "all-in rate," the NRA must specify whether additional surcharges, additional assessorial charges, or ocean common carrier general rate increases ("GRIs") will apply.

(ii) The NRA may list the additional surcharges or assessorial charges, including pass-through charges, or reference specific surcharges or assessorial charges in the NVOCC's rules tariff.

(iii) If the additional surcharges or assessorial charges are included in the NVOCC's rules tariff, those additional surcharges or assessorial charges and the corresponding amounts specified in the rules tariff must be fixed once the first shipment has been received by the NVOCC until the last shipment is delivered, subject to an amendment of the NRA.

(iv) For any pass-through charge for which a specific amount is not included in the NRA or the rules tariff, the NVOCC may only invoice the shipper for charges the NVOCC incurs, with no markup.
