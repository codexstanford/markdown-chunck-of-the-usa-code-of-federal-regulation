####### Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 3.

(3)Slip-on flanges meeting ASME B16.5 may be used in piping systems of Class I, Class II, or Class II-L not to exceed the service pressure-temperature ratings for flanges of class 300 and lower, within the temperature limitations of the material selected for use, and not to exceed 4-inch Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) in systems of Class I and Class II-L. If 100 percent radiography is required by 46 CFR 56.95-10 for the class, diameter, wall thickness, and material of the pipe being joined, then slip-on flanges are not permitted and butt-welding flanges are required. The configuration in Figure 127.4.4B(b) of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2), using a face and backweld, may be preferable where eliminating void spaces is desirable. For systems of Class II, the size of the strength fillet may be limited to a maximum of 0.525 inch instead of 1.4T, and the distance from the face of the flange to the end of the pipe may be a maximum of three-eighths of an inch. Restrictions on the use of slip-on flanges appear in 46 CFR 56.50-105 for low-temperature piping systems.
