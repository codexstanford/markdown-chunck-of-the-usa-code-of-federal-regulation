###### Withdrawals for obligations or liquidation.

(a)(1) Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, after having been executed by the taxpayer, shall be forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal, including properly certified invoices or other supporting papers. Such instruments of withdrawal, if payable to the Administration, will be deposited by the Administration for collection, and the proceeds thereof, upon collection, will be credited to the appropriate contract with the Administration; but if drawn to the order of payees other than the Administration, after countersignature on behalf of the Administration, will ordinarily be forwarded to the payees.
