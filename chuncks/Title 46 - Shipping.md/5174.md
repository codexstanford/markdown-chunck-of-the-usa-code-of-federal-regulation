##### Appendix A to Part 109 - Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular No. 4-78 - Inspection and Certification of Existing Mobile Offshore Drilling Units
###### Background.

2.Mobile Offshore Drilling Units are recognized internationally through the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization as being a "special purpose ship" designed and operated to carry out an industrial function at sea. Contemporary U.S. Vessel regulations in Title 46 CFR do not adequately cover the safety considerations which are unique to the hull and structural designs, industrial equipment and operating procedures incorporated in drilling vessels. To provide appropriate and adequate standards, the Coast Guard with the assistance of the National Offshore Operations Advisory Committee, and following the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, developed Subchapter IA, Regulations for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units, 46 CFR Parts 107-109 and amendments to 46 CFR Subchapters "F", Marine Engineering Regulations, and "J", Electrical Engineering Regulations. These regulations, published in(43 FR 56788 December 4, 1978) will apply to all units contracted for on or after the effective date of the regulations.
