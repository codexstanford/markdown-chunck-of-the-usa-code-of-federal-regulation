###### Chart format-

There are different degrees of reactivity among the various cargoes. Many of them are relatively non-reactive: For example, aromatic hydrocarbons or paraffins. Others will form hazardous combinations with many groups: For example, the inorganic acids.

The cargo groups in the compatibility chart are separated into two categories: 1 through 22 are "Reactive Groups" and 30 through 43 are "Cargo Groups". Left unassigned and available for future expansion are groups 23 through 29 and those past 43. Reactive Groups contain products which are chemically the most reactive; dangerous combinations may result between members of different Reactive Groups and between members of Reactive Groups and Cargo Groups. Products assigned to Cargo Groups, however, are much less reactive; dangerous combinations involving these can be formed only with members of certain Reactive Groups. Cargo Groups do not react hazardously with one another.
