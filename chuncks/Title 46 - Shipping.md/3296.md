###### ยง 62.35-5 Remote propulsion-control systems.
####### Main navigating bridge propulsion control.

(c)(1) Navigating bridge remote propulsion control must be performed by a single control device for each independent propeller. Control must include automatic performance of all associated services, and must not permit rate of movement of the control device to overload the propulsion machinery.

(2) On vessels propelled by steam turbines, the navigation bridge primary control system must include safety limit controls for high and low boiler water levels and low steam pressure. Actuation of these limits must be alarmed on the navigating bridge and at the maneuvering platform or ECC.

(3) On vessels propelled by internal combustion engines, an alarm must annunciate on the navigating bridge and at the maneuvering platform or ECC, if provided, to indicate starting capability less than 50% of that required by ยง 62.35-35. If the primary remote control system provides automatic starting, the number of automatic consecutive attempts that fail to produce a start must be limited to reserve 50% of the required starting capability.
