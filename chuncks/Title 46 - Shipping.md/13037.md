###### Purchase-money obligations.

(c)Where the proceeds from the sale of a vessel include purchase-money obligations, such obligations together with the entire collateral therefor, or, in the case of deposit of the proceeds of a share in the vessel, a proportionate part of the obligations and collateral as determined by the Administration, shall be deposited, with the remainder of the proceeds, in the construction reserve fund as a part of the "net proceeds". The depository shall receive payment of all amounts due on such purchase-money obligations and such amounts shall be placed in the fund in substitution for the portion of the obligations paid. All installments of purchase-money obligations shall be paid directly into the fund by the obligor. In the event any such installment is not so deposited, the Administration, at any time after the due date, may require the taxpayer to deposit an amount equal to such installment. If the taxpayer so desires, he may deposit in the construction reserve fund cash or approved securities in an amount equal to the face value of any purchase-money obligations in lieu of depositing such obligations.
