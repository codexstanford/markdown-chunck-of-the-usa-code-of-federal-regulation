(a) Passenger vessels required to be marked with subdivision load lines, engaged on foreign and coastwise voyages other than the Great Lakes voyages, shall not submerge in salt water the subdivision load line applicable to the voyage. Passenger vessels engaged on ocean, foreign or coastwise voyages may be marked with fresh water load lines. A passenger vessel on foreign or coastwise voyages (except Great Lakes voyages) may have an allowance made for the degree of brackishness of the water in which the vessel is floating but not for the weight of fuel, water, etc., required for consumption between the point of departure and the open sea, and no allowance is to be made for bilge or ballast water that may be in the passenger vessel at the time of departure.
