####### Rescue boat seating space test

(vi)(Paragraph 1/7.1.3). The average mass of persons used to test the rescue boat seating space must be determined by weighing as a group or individually. Each person must wear an inherently buoyant SOLAS lifejacket with at least 150 N of buoyancy or a Coast Guard-approved lifejacket approved under approval series 160.155. The operator(s) must demonstrate that the rescue boat can be operated while wearing a Coast Guard approved, insulated-buoyant immersion suit approved under approval series 160.171. The Commandant will give consideration to requests to test at, and designate rescue boats for, a heavier occupant weight than that stated in the IMO LSA Code, chapter V (incorporated by reference, § 160.156-5 of this subpart).
