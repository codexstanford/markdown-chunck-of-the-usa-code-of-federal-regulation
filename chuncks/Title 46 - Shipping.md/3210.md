####### Pneumatic tests.

(h)(1) Pressure vessels that were pneumatically tested before being stamped with the Coast Guard Symbol must be examined internally twice every 5 years and examined externally at each Inspection for Certification. No more than 3 years may elapse between any external examination and its immediate predecessor.

(2) For tanks whose design precludes a thorough internal or external examination, the thickness must be determined by a nondestructive method acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

(3) If (due to the product carried) your vessel's inspection intervals are prescribed in subchapter D (Tank Vessels), subchapter I (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels), or subchapter I-A (Mobile Offshore Drilling Units), you must comply with the pneumatic test regulations there, instead of the ones in this section.
