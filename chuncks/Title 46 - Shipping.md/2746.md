####### Small parts.

(f)The manufacturer of small parts, either cast or forged, may certify a lot of not more than 20 duplicate parts or 5 short tons, whichever is less, by reporting the results of one set of Charpy impact specimens, or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, taken from one such part selected at random, provided the same kind of material and the same process of production were used for all of the lot. When the part is too small to provide the specimens of at least minimum size, no impact test need be made. For such parts too small to impact test, toughness qualifications shall be determined by the Commandant based on material, chemical, and mechanical properties.
