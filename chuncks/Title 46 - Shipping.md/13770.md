(ii)(A) If the Maritime Administrator determines that an individual has failed to fulfill any part of the service obligations (described in ยง 310.7(b)(3)), such individual may be ordered to active duty to serve a period of time not less than two (2) years and not more than the unexpired portion of the service obligation contract relating to service in the foreign or domestic commerce or the national defense, as determined by the Maritime Administrator. The Maritime Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall determine in which service the individual shall be ordered to active duty to serve such period of time. In cases of hardship, as determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime Administrator may waive this provision in whole or in part.

(B) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to active duty under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section or if the Maritime Administrator determines that reimbursement of the Cost of Education Provided would better serve the interests of the United States, the Maritime Administrator may recover from the individual the Cost of Education Provided, plus interest and attorney's fees.

(C) The Maritime Administrator may reduce the amount to be recovered under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section from such individual to reflect partial performance of service obligations and such other factors as the Maritime Administrator determines merit such reduction.
