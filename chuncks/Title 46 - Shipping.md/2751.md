(a) The Coast Guard will give consideration to the enhanced yield and tensile strength properties of ferrous and nonferrous materials at low temperature for the purpose of establishing allowable stress values for service temperature below 0 &#xB0;F.

(b) The use of such allowable stress values must be specially approved by the Coast Guard for each application. Further information may be obtained by writing to the Commandant (CG-ENG), Attn: Office of Design and Engineering Systems, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7509, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593.

(c) Submittals must include information and calculations specified by the U.S. Coast Guard, Office of Design and Engineering Standards (CG-ENG) to demonstrate that the allowable stress for the material cannot be exceeded under any possible combination of vessel loads and metal temperature.
