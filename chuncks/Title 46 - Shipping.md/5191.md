###### Unfired Pressure Vessels.

(11)(a) Unfired pressure vessels built and stamped in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code may be continued in service as long as they remain in satisfactory condition. At the original and subsequent inspections for certification, ASME Code pressure vessels must be tested and examined in accordance with the requirements in 46 CFR 61.10-5.

(b) Unfired pressure vessels which cannot be identified as being constructed to any recognized standard may be continued in service provided that no obvious defects are noted. These pressure vessels shall be hydrostatically tested to one and one half times the working pressure. For pressure vessels that can not be reasonably hydrostatically tested, nondestructive testing may be used to verify the pressure vessels condition for continued serviceability. These pressure vessels will then be stamped with a Coast Guard identification number and periodically tested and examined in accordance with the requirements in 46 CFR 61.10-5.
