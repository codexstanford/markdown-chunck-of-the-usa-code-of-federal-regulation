###### ยง 91.55-15 Procedure for submittal of plans.

(a) As the relative location of shipyards, design offices, and Coast Guard offices vary throughout the country, no specific routing will be required in the submittal of plans. In general, one of the following procedures would apply, but in a particular case, if a more expeditious procedure can be used, there will be no objection to its adoption.

(1) The plans may be submitted to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, in the district in which the vessel is to be built. This procedure will be most expeditious in the case of those offices where personnel and facilities are available for examination and approval of the plans locally.

(2) The plans may be submitted directly to the Commandant (CG-ENG), Attn: Office of Design and Engineering Systems, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7509, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7509. In this case, the plans will be returned directly to the submitter, with a copy of the action being forwarded to the interested Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.
