####### Stability and retroreflective material.

(8)While wearing the suit in water without any auxiliary means of buoyancy, each subject assumes a face-up position and then allows his or her body to become limp. The distance from the water surface to the lowest part of the subject's mouth or nose is measured. This procedure is repeated using the auxiliary means of buoyancy, if one is provided. For each test subject, the stable position and the distance of the mouth and nose above the water must be prescribed in § 160.171-11(a)(2) and § 160.171-11(a)(3). During this test, each subject must be viewed by observers to determine whether the retroreflective material of the suit meets § 160.171-9(n).
