###### ยง 69.20 Applying tonnage thresholds.
####### Alternate tonnage thresholds.

(d)46 U.S.C. 14104 authorizes the Coast Guard to establish tonnage thresholds based on the Convention Measurement System as an alternative to tonnage thresholds based on the Regulatory Measurement System. Although 46 U.S.C. 14104 addresses only thresholds in Federal statutes, it does not preclude establishing alternate tonnage thresholds for Federal regulations that currently specify thresholds that were based on the Regulatory Measurement System, where appropriate.

(1) If an alternate tonnage threshold is prescribed or authorized by Federal statute or regulation, apply the alternate tonnage threshold using the Convention Measurement System tonnage.

(2) A vessel regulated under paragraph (d) of this section must not be measured under the Regulatory Measurement System.
