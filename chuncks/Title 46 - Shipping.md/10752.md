####### § 169.521 Stowage.
######## Lifeboat stowage.

(b)Each lifeboat must be stowed to meet the following requirements:

(1) Each lifeboat must be attached to a separate set of davits.

(2) Lifeboats must not be stowed in the bow of the vessel nor so far aft as to be endangered by the propellers or overhang of the stern.

(3) Lifeboats must be stowed so that it is not necessary to lift them in order to swing out the davits.

(4) Means must be provided for bringing the lifeboats against the ship's side and holding them there so that persons may safely embark, unless the lifeboats are arranged for boarding at the stowage position.

(5) Lifeboats must be fitted with skates or other suitable means to facilitate launching against an adverse list of up to 15 degrees. However, skates may be dispensed with if, in the opinion of the Commandant, the arrangements ensure that the lifeboats can be satisfactorily launched without them.

(6) Means must be provided outside the machinery space to prevent the discharge of water into the lifeboats while they are being lowered.
