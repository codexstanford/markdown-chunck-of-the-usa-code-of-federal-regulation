###### Determination of value.

(b)(1) For the purpose of determining the amount in the fund, the value of securities shall be their "market value" (which shall be the basis for determining value, unless otherwise agreed to by the administration) and shall be determined in the following manner:

(i) In instances where no actual purchase is involved, such as the initial deposit of securities in the fund in lieu of cash, the last sales price thereof on the principal exchange on the day the deposit was made shall be deemed to be the "market value" thereof, or, if no such sales were made, the "market value" thereof will be determined by the Administration on such basis as it may deem to be fair and reasonable in each case.
