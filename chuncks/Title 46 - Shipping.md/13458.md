####### Vessel eligibility.

(b)We may not approve a Guarantee for an Eligible Export Vessel unless:

(1) We find that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the Vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be essential in time of war or national emergency;

(2) The owner of the Vessel agrees with us that the Vessel shall not be transferred to any country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United States; and

(3) We determine that the countries in which the shipowner, its charterers, guarantors, or other financial interests supporting the transaction, if any, have their chief executive offices or have located a substantial portion of their assets, present an acceptable financial or legal risk to our collateral interests. Our determination will be based on confidential risk assessments provided by the Inter-Agency Country Risk Assessment System and will take into account any other factors related to the loan guarantee transaction that we deem pertinent.
