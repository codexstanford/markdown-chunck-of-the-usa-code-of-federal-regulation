####### Heptane ignition.

(8)(i) A metal pan must be used to hold a layer of water at least 12mm (in.) deep with a layer of technical grade heptane on top of the water. The pan must be at least 1 m (39 in.) square with sides extending between 175 mm (7 in.) and 200 mm (8 in.) above the surface of the water. The amount of heptane used to form the layer must be 2.0 liters per square meter of pan area (6.25 fluid ounces per square foot).

(ii) The test must be conducted in a draft-free location. The ambient temperature, the temperature of the water, and the temperature of the heptane must all be between 20 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F) and 25 &#xB0;C (77 &#xB0;F) at the time of the test.

(iii) The signal under test must be held with the flame end pointing upward at an angle of approximately 45&#xB0;, 1.2 m (4 ft.) directly above the center of the pan. The signal must be ignited as soon as the heptane is observed to spread out over the water in continuous layer. The signal must be allowed to burn completely, and must remain in position until it has cooled.

(iv) The heptane must not be ignited by the flare or by material from the flare.
