### PART 401 - GREAT LAKES PILOTAGE REGULATIONS
#### Subpart B - Registration of Pilots
##### ยง 401.220 Registration of pilots.

(a) The Director shall determine the number of pilots required to be registered in order to assure adequate and efficient pilotage service in the United States waters of the Great Lakes and to provide for equitable participation of United States Registered Pilots with Canadian Registered Pilots in the rendering of pilotage services. The Director determines the number of pilots needed as follows:

(1) The Director determines the base number of pilots needed by dividing each area's peak pilotage demand data by its pilot work cycle. The pilot work cycle standard includes any time that the Director finds to be a necessary and reasonable component of ensuring that a pilotage assignment is carried out safely, efficiently, and reliably for each area. These components may include, but are not limited to-

(i) Amount of time a pilot provides pilotage service or is available to a vessel's master to provide pilotage service;

(ii) Pilot travel time, measured from the pilot's base, to and from an assignment's starting and ending points;

(iii) Assignment delays and detentions;

(iv) Administrative time for a pilot who serves as a pilotage association's president;

(v) Rest between assignments, as required by ยง 401.451;

(vi) Ten days' recuperative rest per month from April 15 through November 15 each year, provided that lesser rest allowances are approved by the Director at the pilotage association's request, if necessary to provide pilotage without interruption through that period; and

(vii) Pilotage-related training.

(2) Pilotage demand and the base seasonal work standard are based on available and reliable data, as so deemed by the Director, for a multi-year base period. The multi-year period is the 10 most recent full shipping seasons, and the data source is a system approved under 46 CFR 403.300. Where such data are not available or reliable, the Director also may use data, from additional past full shipping seasons or other sources, that the Director determines to be available and reliable.

(3) The number of pilots needed in each district is calculated by totaling the area results by district and rounding them up to a whole integer. For supportable circumstances, the Director may make reasonable and necessary adjustments to the rounded result to provide for changes that the Director anticipates will affect the need for pilots in the district over the period for which base rates are being established.

(b) Registration of pilots shall be made from among those Applicant Pilots who have (1) completed the minimum number of trips prescribed by the Commandant over the waters for which application is made on oceangoing vessels, in company with a Registered Pilot, within 1 year of date of application, (2) completed a course of instruction for Applicant Pilots prescribed by the association authorized to establish the pilotage pool, (3) satisfactorily completed a written examination prescribed by the Commandant, evidencing his knowledge and understanding of the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations, Rules and Orders; the Memorandum of Arrangements, Great Lakes Pilotage, between the United States and Canada; and other related matters including the working rules and operating procedures of his district, given at such time and place as the Commandant may designate within the pilotage district of the Applicant Pilot.

(c) The Pilot Association authorized to establish a pool in which an Applicant Pilot has qualified for registration under paragraph (b) of this section shall submit to the Director in writing its recommendations together with its reasons for the registration of the Applicant.

(d) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a pilot found to be qualified under this subpart shall be issued a Certificate of Registration, valid for a term of five (5) years or until the expiration of his master's, mate's or pilot's endorsement issued under the authority of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes or until the pilot reaches age 70, whichever occurs first.

(e) The Director may, when necessary to assure adequate and efficient pilotage service, issue a temporary certificate of registration for a period of less than 1 year to any person found qualified under this subpart regardless of age.
