#### PART 390 - CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION FUND
##### ยง 390.9 Qualified withdrawals.
###### Payment of principal on indebtedness.

(4)46 U.S.C. 53509(a)(2) provides that any indebtedness which the party proposes to pay through qualified withdrawals must be shown to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator to have been incurred in direct connection with the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a qualified agreement vessel. The fact that indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified agreement vessel is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the direct connection. It is not necessary that the lien or mortgage securing the indebtedness be on the vessel. For example, if the party mortgages an office building in order to finance the construction of a vessel, payments of principal on the mortgage may be made with qualified withdrawals.
