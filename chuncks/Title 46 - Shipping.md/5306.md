####### Circuit breaker poles.

(1)There must be separate circuit breaker poles for the positive and negative leads, and, unless the main poles provide protection, for each equalizer lead. If there are equalizer poles for a three-wire generator, each overload trip must be of the "Algebraic" type. If there is a neutral pole in the generator circuit breaker, there must not be an overload trip element for the neutral pole. In this case, there must be a neutral overcurrent relay and alarm system that is set to function at a current value not more than the neutral rating.
