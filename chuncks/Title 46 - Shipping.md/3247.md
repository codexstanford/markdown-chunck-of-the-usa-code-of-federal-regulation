(a) Test procedure documents must be in a step-by-step or checkoff list format. Each test instruction must specify equipment status, apparatus necessary to perform the tests, safety precautions, safety control and alarm setpoints, the procedure to be followed, and the expected test result.

(b) Test techniques must not simulate monitored system conditions by mis-adjustment, artificial signals, improper wiring, tampering, or revision of the system unless the test would damage equipment or endanger personnel. In the latter case, the use of a synthesized signal or condition applied to the sensor is acceptable if test equipment is maintained in good working order and is periodically calibrated to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. Other test techniques must be approved by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center.
