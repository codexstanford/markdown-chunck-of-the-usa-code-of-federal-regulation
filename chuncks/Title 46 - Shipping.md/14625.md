(2) For purposes of this section the termis used to reflect an interest in a vessel and means a proprietary interest in a vessel such as, for example, that which results from joint ownership. Accordingly, a share within the meaning of ยง 391.2(f) (relating to the definition of "agreement vessel" for the purpose of making deposits) will not necessarily be sufficient to be treated as a share within the meaning of this section.
