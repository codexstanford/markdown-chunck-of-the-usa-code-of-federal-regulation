####### Apparatus.

(2)The apparatus shall consist of a compression device with two parallel plates, between which the test specimen shall be compressed by means of four studs and nuts. The plates may be steel, aluminum or any rigid smooth metal of sufficient thickness to withstand the required compression stresses without bending. The surfaces against which the test specimens are held shall be smooth and shall be thoroughly cleaned and wiped dry before each test. Metal shims inserted between the plates shall be used to limit the compression of the specimen.
