####### Valuation.

(a)The valuation in the policy for damage to, or actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured shall be a stated valuation (exclusive of National Defense features paid for by the Government) determined by the Maritime Administrator which shall not exceed the amount that would be payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 563 at the time of the attachment of the insurance under said policy: Provided, however, that in the case of a construction subsidized vessel, for the period of insurance prior to requisition for title or use, the valuation so determined shall be reduced by such proportion as the amount of construction subsidy paid with respect to the vessel bears to the entire construction cost and capital improvements thereof (excluding the cost of national defense features), and for the period of insurance after requisition for use the valuation so determined shall not exceed the amount which would be payable under 46 U.S.C. 56303 in the case of requisition for title or use: Provided, further, that the insured shall have the right within sixty (60) days after the attachment of the insurance under said policy, or within sixty (60) days after determination of such valuation by the Maritime Administrator, whichever is later, to reject such valuation, and shall pay, at the rate provided for in said policy, premiums upon such asserted valuation as the insured shall specify at the time of rejection, but such asserted valuation shall not operate to the prejudice of the Government in any subsequent action on the policy. In the event of the actual or constructive total loss of the vessel, if the insured has not rejected such valuation the amount of any claim therefor which is adjusted, compromised, settled, adjudged, or paid shall not exceed such stated amount, but if the insured has so rejected such valuation, the insured shall be paid as a tentative advance only, 75 per centum of such valuation so determined by the Maritime Administrator and shall be entitled to sue the United States in a court having jurisdiction of such claims to recover such valuation as would be equal to the just compensation which such court determines would have been payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 563 at the time of the attachment of the insurance under said policy: Provided, however, that in the case of a construction-subsidized vessel, the valuation determined by the court as such just compensation for any period of insurance prior to actual requisition for title or use of the vessel shall be reduced by such proportion as the amount of construction subsidy paid with respect to the vessel bears to the entire construction cost and capital improvements thereof (excluding the cost of national defense features), and for any period of insurance after actual requisition for use, the valuation determined by the court shall be the amount which would have been payable under 46 U.S.C. 56303 in the case of requisition for title: And provided further, that in the event of an election by the insured to reject the stated valuation fixed by the Maritime Administrator and to sue in the courts, the amount of the judgment will be payable without regard to any limitations provided by statute, although the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation that is over the amount of the court judgment shall be required to be refunded by the insured. In the event of such court determination, premiums under the policy shall be adjusted on the basis of the valuation as finally determined and of the rate provided for in said policy. The "stated valuation" of the vessel insured refers to the vessel as described in ยง 309.5 of this chapter.
