####### Storage temperature.

(f)Two samples of the immersion suits, in their storage cases, must be alternately subjected to surrounding temperatures of -30 &#xB0;C to + 65 &#xB0;C. These alternating cycles need not follow immediately after each other and the following procedure, repeated for a total of ten cycles, is acceptable:

(1) 8 hours conditioning at 65 &#xB0;C to be completed in one day;

(2) The specimens removed from the warm chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day;

(3) 8 hours conditioning at -30 &#xB0;C to be completed the next day; and

(4) The specimens removed from the cold chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day. At the conclusion of the final cycle of cold storage, two test subjects who successfully completed the donning test in paragraph (c)(2) of this section enter the cold chamber, unpack and don the immersion suits. Alternatively, the suits may be unpacked in the chamber, then removed and immediately donned. Neither of the suits must show damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities.
