###### § 162.050-23 Separator: Approval tests.
####### Test No. 1C.

(d) The following tests must be conducted using Test Fluid C:The separator is fed with a mixture composed of 6 percent Test Fluid C and 94 percent water by volume such that the emulsified Test Fluid C content is approximately 3,000 ppm in the test water until a steady flow rate occurs. After the flow rate is steady, the influent containing the 6 percent Test Fluid C solution is fed to the separator operating automatically for 3 hours. Samples of separated water effluent are taken at 50 minutes and 100 minutes. At the end of the 3-hour period, the air cock on the test rig is opened and, if necessary, the oil and water supply valves are closed to stop the flow of influent. A sample is then taken of the separated water effluent as the effluent flow ceases.
