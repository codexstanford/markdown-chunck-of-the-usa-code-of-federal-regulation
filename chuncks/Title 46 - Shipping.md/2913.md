####### Installation.

(b)(1) All fuel pipes, pipe connections, and accessories shall be readily accessible. The piping shall run in sight wherever practicable, protected against mechanical injury, and effectively secured against excessive movement and vibration by the use of soft nonferrous metal liners or straps without sharp edges. Where passing through steel decks or bulkheads, fuel lines shall be protected by close fitting ferrules or stuffing boxes. Refer to ยง 56.30-25 for tubing joint installations.

(2) Either a short length of suitable metallic or nonmetallic flexible tubing or hose or a loop of annealed copper tubing must be installed in the fuel-supply line at or near the engine to prevent damage by vibration.

(i) If nonmetallic flexible hose is used, it must meet the requirements of 46 CFR 56.60-25(b) for fuel service.

(ii) Flexible hose connections should maintain metallic contact between the sections of the fuel-supply lines; however, if they do not, the fuel tank must be grounded.

(3) Valves in fuel lines shall be installed to close against the flow.
