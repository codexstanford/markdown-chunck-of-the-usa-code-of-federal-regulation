(e)() The stresses due to hydrostatic head shall be taken into account in determining the minimum thickness of the shell or head of any boiler pressure part unless noted otherwise. Additional stresses, imposed by effects other than internal pressure or static head, which increase the average stress over substantial sections of the shell or head by more than 10 percent of the allowable stress shall be taken into account. These effects include the weight of the vessel and its contents, method of support, impact loads, superimposed loads, localized stresses due to the reactions of supports, stresses due to temperature gradients and dynamic effects.
