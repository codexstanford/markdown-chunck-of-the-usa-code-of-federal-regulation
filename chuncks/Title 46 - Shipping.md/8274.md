####### Chromaticity.

(4)The color of the burning signal must be vivid red as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the "Color Names Dictionary." Two identical test plates of white cardboard about 30 cm x 60 cm (12&#x2033; x 24&#x2033;) are used. Except for a negligible amount of stray daylight, the first test plate is illuminated by light from the specimen placed at a distance of about 1.5 cm (5 ft.). The second test plate is illuminated only by light from an incandescent lamp operated at a color temperature close to 2,848&#xB0; K at a distance of about 30 cm (1 ft.). The first plate is viewed directly, the second through combinations of lovibond red, yellow, and blue glasses selected so as to approximate a chromaticity match. By separating the test plates by a wide unilluminated area (subtending at the observer about 45&#xB0;), it is possible to make accurate determinations of chromaticity in terms of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer and Coordinate System, in spite of fluctuations in luminous intensity of the specimen by factors as high as 2 or 3. The CIE coordinates are converted to the Munsell notation which is cross-referenced to the color name in Section 13 of the "Color Names Dictionary" (see the discussion in section 10 of "the Universal Color Language").
