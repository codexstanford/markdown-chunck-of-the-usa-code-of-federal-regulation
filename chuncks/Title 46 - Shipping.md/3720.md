(ii) Under

(A) For a U.S. flag vessel, these resolutions allow tonnage thresholds in effect on July 18, 1994 to be applied using the gross register tonnage (Regulatory Measurement System), to a vessel whose keel was laid on or after July 18, 1982 but before July 19, 1994, and which did not subsequently undergo alterations resulting in a change substantially affecting its tonnage as deemed by the Commandant.

(B) For a foreign flag vessel, these resolutions allow tonnage thresholds in effect on July 18, 1994 to be applied, at the vessel owner's option, using the foreign country's national measurement system tonnage, to a vessel whose keel was laid on or after July 18, 1982, but on or before July 18, 1994, and which did not undergo alterations after July 18, 1994 of a magnitude deemed by that country to constitute a substantial variation in its tonnage subject to the provisions of these resolutions.

(iii) Any other international grandfathering provisions as authorized under appropriate International Maritime Organization instruments to which the United States is a party, or which are otherwise recognized or accepted by the United States.

(2) For all other vessels, apply all tonnage thresholds using Regulatory Measurement System tonnage.
