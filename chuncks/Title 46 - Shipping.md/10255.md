####### Procedure.

(2)(i) The tensile strength of the specimens shall be determined in a standard tensile testing machine with a rate of separation of jaws set at 2 inches per minute. The bench marks shall be followed with a suitable pair of dividers until the specimen ruptures. A minimum of 4 specimens shall be tested and if any specimen breaks at the clamp or any specimen exhibits any obvious defects, the results obtained therewith shall be discarded. A new similar specimen shall then be prepared and tested. The tensile strength shall be calculated by dividing the breaking load (to the nearest 0.1 pound) by the original area of the cross section of the specimen in square inches and the result shall be expressed in pounds per square inch. The percent ultimate elongation shall be calculated as follows:
