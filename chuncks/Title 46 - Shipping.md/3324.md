####### Flooding safety.

(e)(1) Machinery space bilges, bilge wells, shaft alley bilges, and other minimally attended locations where liquids might accumulate must be monitored from the ECC to detect flooding angles from vertical of up to 15&#xB0; heel and 5&#xB0; trim.

(2) The ECC must include the controls necessary to bring at least one independent bilge pump and independent bilge suction required by ยง 56.50-50(e) of this chapter into operation to counter flooding.

(3) Where watertight doors in subdivision bulkheads are required in the machinery spaces, they must be Class 3 watertight doors and must be controllable from the ECC and the required navigating bridge control location.

(4) Controls must be provided to operate the sea inlet and discharge valves required by ยง 56.50-95(d) of this chapter and the emergency bilge suction required by ยง 56.50-50(f). These controls must be arranged to allow time for operation in the event of flooding with the vessel in the fully loaded condition. Time considerations must include detection, crew response, and control operation time.
