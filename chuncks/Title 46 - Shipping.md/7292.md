#### PART 151-BARGES CARRYING BULK LIQUID HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CARGOES
##### Subpart 151.45-Operations
###### ยง 151.45-2 Special operating requirements.

(a) The requirements of this section shall apply to all barges carrying in bulk any cargoes regulated by this subchapter; however, the provisions of this section are not applicable to such barges when empty and gas-freed.

(b) When it is necessary to operate box or square-end barges as lead barges of tows, the person in charge of the towing vessel shall control the speed to insure protection against diving and swamping of such barges, having due regard to their design and freeboard, and to the operating conditions.

(c) No cargo tank hatch, ullage hole, or tank cleaning openings shall be opened or remain open except under the supervision of the person in charge, except when the tank is gas free.

(d) Barges, when tendered to the carrier for transportation, shall have all bilges and void spaces (except those used for ballasting) substantially free of water. Periodic inspections and necessary pumping shall be carried out to insure maintenance of such water-free condition in order to minimize the free surface effects, both in longitudinal and transverse directions. Except when otherwise considered necessary for inspection or pumping, all hatch covers and other hull closure devices for void spaces and hull compartments other than cargo spaces shall be closed and secured at all times.
