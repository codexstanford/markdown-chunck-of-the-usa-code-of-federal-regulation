####### Impact test.

(p)(1) an uninflated lifejacket is secured to the test form shown in Figure 160.176-13(n)(2). The lifejacket, with the automatic inflation mechanism disabled, is secured to the form as it is intended to be worn. The lifejacket is accelerated to 25 m/s (50 mph) horizontally and is then dropped from a height of not more than 0.5 m (1.5 ft.) into the water in the following positions:

(i) Face down, shoulder forward.

(ii) Face down, shoulder back.

(iii) Back down, shoulder forward.

(iv) Back down, shoulder back.

(v) Left side down, shoulder forward.

(vi) Right side down, shoulder back.

(2) Following each impact, there must be no sign of functional deterioration, and the lifejacket must not come off of the test form. After each impact the closures may be readjusted as necessary.

(3) Following the six impacts, the lifejacket must fully inflate using only its oral inflation mechanisms.

(4) The test in this paragraph is repeated on the same lifejacket after inflating, with manual inflation mechanisms, all chambers that have those mechanism.
