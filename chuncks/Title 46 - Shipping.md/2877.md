(b)(1) Brazed socket-type joints shall not be used on systems containing flammable or combustible fluids in areas where fire hazards are involved or where the service temperature exceeds 425 &#xB0;F. When specifically approved by the Commandant, brazed construction may be used for service temperatures up to 525 &#xB0;F. in boiler steam air heaters provided the requirements of UB-12 of section VIII ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) are satisfied at the highest temperature desired.

(2) Brazed joints depending solely upon a fillet, rather than primarily upon brazing material between the pipe and socket are not acceptable.
