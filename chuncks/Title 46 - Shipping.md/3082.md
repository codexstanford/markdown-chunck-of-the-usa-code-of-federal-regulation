####### Exhausts.

(c)(1) Where piping is used for gas turbine exhaust lines, Class II is required as a minimum. (See subpart 56.04 of this subchapter.) Where the exhaust pressure exceeds 150 pounds per square inch, such as in closed cycle systems, Class I shall be used. Where ducting other than pipe is employed, the drawings and design data shall be submitted to substantiate suitability and safety for the intended service.

(2) Where considered necessary, gas turbines and associated exhaust systems shall be suitably insulated or cooled, by means of lagging, water spray, or a combination thereof.

(3) Gas turbine exhausts shall not be interconnected with boiler uptakes except for gas turbines used for emergency power and lighting or for emergency propulsion. Dampers or other suitable means shall be installed to prevent backflow of boiler exhaust gases through the turbine. Interconnected exhausts must be specifically approved by the Commandant.

(4) A gas turbine exhaust on a mobile offshore drilling unit must not discharge in a classified location.
