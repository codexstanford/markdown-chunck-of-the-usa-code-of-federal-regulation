(b) Where the shell plate is bagged due to overheating, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may, if in his judgment it is practicable, permit the same to be driven back to its original position.

(c) Where the shell plate has blistered, bagged, or bulged to such an extent that there is an appreciable thinning of the plate, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, shall require the defective portion to be cut away and the shell repaired by fitting a patch of steel plate conforming to the requirements of ยง 52.01-90 of this subchapter in place of the defective portion. Care shall be taken that the riveting schedule of the patch is so arranged as to give the plate sufficient strength to withstand the stress placed on it in service.
