(4)ASME B16.5 socket welding flanges may be used in Class I or II-L systems not exceeding 3 NPS for class 600 and lower class flanges and 21/2NPS for class 900 and class 1500 flanges within the service pressure-temperature ratings of the standard. Whenever full radiography is required by 46 CFR 56.95-10 for the class, diameter, and wall thickness of the pipe being joined, the use of socket welding flanges is not permitted and a butt weld type connection must be provided. For Class II piping, socket welding flanges may be used without diameter limitation, and the size of the fillet weld may be limited to a maximum of 0.525 inch instead of 1.4T. Restrictions on the use of socket welds appear in 46 CFR 56.50-105 for low temperature piping systems.
