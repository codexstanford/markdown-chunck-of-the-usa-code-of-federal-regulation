Pumprooms equipped with power ventilation shall have the ventilation outlets terminate more than six feet from any opening to the interior part of the vessel which normally contains sources of vapor ignition.

The capacity of power ventilation units shall be sufficient to effect a complete change of air in not more than 3 minutes, based upon the volume of the pumproom and associated trunks up to the deck at which access from the weather is provided.
