####### Open vessels.

(o)(1) An open vessel is a vessel without an uppermost complete deck.

(2) The line of the tonnage deck for an open vessel is the upper edge of the upper strake. Depths of transverse sections are taken from this line.

(3) Any vessel, other than one having a mechanically refrigerated hold, that is not an open vessel and that has a tonnage length of less than 50 feet is measured as an open vessel, if the distance between the line of its tonnage deck and the upper edge of the upper strake is more than one-sixth of the midship depth. "Midship depth" means the depth measured from the line of the upper edge of the upper strake to the point in the bottom used for measuring tonnage depths.
