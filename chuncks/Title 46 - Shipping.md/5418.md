####### Overcurrent protection.

(a)A conductor of a control, interlock, or indicator circuit of a motor controller must be protected against overcurrent unless:

(1) The conductor is wholly within the controller enclosure;

(2) The rating or setting of the branch circuit overcurrent device is not more than 300 percent of the current-carrying capacity of the control, interlock, or indicator circuit conductor;

(3) There is an overcurrent device in each side of the line that has a rating or setting of not more than 300 percent of the current-carrying capacity of the control, electrical interlock, or indicator circuit conductor, except if under operating conditions there is no appreciable difference in potential between the external conductors, overcurrent protection need only be at the supply of that side of the line; or

(4) The opening of the control, interlock, or indicator circuit creates a hazard.
