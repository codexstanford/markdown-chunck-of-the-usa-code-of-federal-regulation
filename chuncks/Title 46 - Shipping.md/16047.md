1. All agreements and modifications to agreements between or among ocean common carriers identified in 46 CFR 535.502 must be accompanied by a completed Information Form to the full extent required in sections I through V of this Form. Sections I and V must be completed by all such agreements. In addition, sections II, III and IV must be completed, as applicable, in accordance with the authority contained in each agreement. Where an agreement containing multiple authorities is subject to duplicate reporting requirements in the various sections of this Form, the parties may provide only one response so long as the reporting requirements within each section are fully addressed. The Information Form specifies the data and information which must be reported for each section and the format in which it must be provided. If a party to an agreement is unable to supply a complete response to any item of this Form, that party shall provide either estimated data (with an explanation of why precise data are not available) or a detailed statement of reasons for noncompliance and the efforts made to obtain the required information. For purposes of this Form, if one of the agreement signatories is a joint service operating under an effective agreement, that signatory shall respond to the Form as a single agreement party.
