####### Painter/painter release.

(19)Each rescue boat must be fitted with a device to secure the painter near the bow of the rescue boat. The device must be arranged such that the rescue boat does not exhibit unsafe or unstable characteristics when being towed by the ship with the ship underway at 5 knots. A quick-release device must be provided, which allows the painter to be released from inside the rescue boat while under tension. The quick-release handle must be clearly identified by a label.
