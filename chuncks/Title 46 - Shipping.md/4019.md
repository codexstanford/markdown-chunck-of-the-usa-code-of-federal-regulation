###### ยง 71.65-15 Procedure for submittal of plans.

(a) As the relative location of shipyards, design offices, and Coast Guard offices vary throughout the country, no specific routing will be required in the submittal of plans. In general, one of the following procedures would apply, but in a particular case, if a more expeditious procedure can be used, there will be no objection to its adoption:

(1) The plans may be submitted to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, in the district in which the vessel is to be built. This procedure will be most expeditious in the case of those offices where personnel and facilities are available for examination and approval of the plans locally.
