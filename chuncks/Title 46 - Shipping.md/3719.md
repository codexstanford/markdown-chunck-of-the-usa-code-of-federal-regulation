(i) Under

(A) For a U.S. flag vessel, this Article allows associated tonnage thresholds in effect on or before July 18, 1994 to be applied, at the vessel owner's option, using Regulatory Measurement System tonnage to a vessel whose keel was laid on or before July 18, 1982, and which did not subsequently undergo alterations resulting in a change in its tonnage of a magnitude deemed by the Commandant to constitute a substantial variation in its tonnage.

(B) For a foreign flag vessel, this Article allows associated tonnage thresholds in effect on or before July 18, 1994, to be applied, at the vessel owner's option, using the foreign country's national measurement system tonnage to a vessel whose keel was laid on or before July 18, 1982, and which did not subsequently undergo alterations resulting in a change in its tonnage of a magnitude deemed by that country to constitute a substantial variation in its tonnage.
