###### ยง 56.50-96 Keel cooler installations.

(a) Keel cooler installations shall meet the requirements of ยง 56.50-95(d)(1) and (2), and (e)(3), and (f) except that shutoff or isolation valves will not be required for the inlet and discharge connections if:

(1) The installation is forward of the collision bulkhead; or,

(2) The installation is integral with the ship's hull such that the cooler tubes are welded directly to the hull of the vessel with the hull forming part of the tube and satisfies all of the following:

(i) The cooler structure is fabricated from material of the same thickness and quality as the hull plating to which it is attached except that in the case of half round pipe lesser thickness may be used if specifically approved by the Commandant. In any case the structure, with the exception of the hull proper, need not exceed three-eighths inch in thickness.

(ii) The flexible connections and all openings internal to the vessel, such as expansion tank vents and fills, in the installation are above the deepest load line and all piping components are Schedule 80 or thicker below the deepest load line.

(iii) Full penetration welds are employed in the fabrication of the structure and its attachment to the hull.

(iv) The forward end of the structure must be faired to the hull such that the horizontal length of the fairing is no less than four times the height of the structure, or be in a protected location such as inside a bow thruster trunk.
