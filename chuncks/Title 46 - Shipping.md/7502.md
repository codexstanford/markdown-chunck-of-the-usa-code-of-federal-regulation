(a) The cross-sectional flow area of any vent system segment, including any PV or SR valve, must at no point be less than that of a pipe whose inside diameter is 6.4 cm (approx. 2.5 in.).

(b) When Table 1 requires a closed or restricted gauging system, calculations must show that, under conditions in which a saturated cargo vapor is discharged through the venting system at the maximum anticipated loading rate, the pressure differential between the cargo tank vapor space and the atmosphere does not exceed 28 kPa gauge (approx. 4 psig), or, for independent tanks, the maximum working pressure of the tank.
