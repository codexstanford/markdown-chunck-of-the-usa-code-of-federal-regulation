###### § 160.170-15 Production inspections, tests, quality control, and conformance of release mechanisms.
####### Production inspections and tests.

(e)Each finished release mechanism must be visually inspected. The manufacturer must develop and maintain a visual inspection checklist designed to ensure that all applicable requirements have been met. Each approved release mechanism constructed with non-corrosion resistant steel must be confirmed to have met the coating mass and bend tests requirement specified under ASTM A 653 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.170-5 of this subpart) after galvanizing or other anti-corrosion treatment has been applied. This compliance can be ascertained through a supplier's certification papers or through conducting actual tests.

(f) Each approved release mechanism must pass each of the tests described in IMO Revised recommendation on testing, part 2, paragraph 6.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.170-5 of this subpart). However, each approved release mechanism for installation of a single-fall rescue boat must pass each of the tests described in IMO Revised recommendation on testing, part 2, paragraph 5.3.1 and 5.3.4.
