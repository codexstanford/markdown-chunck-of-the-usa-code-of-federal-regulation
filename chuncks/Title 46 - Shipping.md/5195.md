e.The intent of the original inspection ofis to identify and commence correction of any unsafe conditions and/or equipment deficiencies and to issue the unit an original Certificate of Inspection. A reasonable period of time will be permitted to correct minor deficiencies. Those items directly affecting personnel safety and health will require immediate attention to correct the unsafe condition. Extensive deficiencies, such as those involving structural aspects or equipment may require up to two years to remedy. Additional times may be allowed if repair facilities are not available to coastal areas adjacent to the unit's area of operation. Where manifestly unsafe conditions are found, the OCMI may require that the unit discontinue operations until such conditions are corrected. If the owner or operator feels aggrieved by the decision of the OCMI, the appeals procedures of 46 CFR 2.01-70 are applicable.

f. Questions concerning this NVIC should be referred to the Commandant (CG-CVC).
