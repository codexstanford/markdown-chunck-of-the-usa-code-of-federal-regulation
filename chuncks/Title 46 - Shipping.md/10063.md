####### Ladder rungs.

(w)Each rigid ladder must have at least six rungs, each with a non-skid surface that does not retain water. Adhesive non-skid sheets may not be used. (For example, a suitable surface for a wooden rung is one that has grooves at least 3 mm (in.) deep cut in a diamond pattern so that water runs off the edge of the step. Non-skid grit is applied directly to the step surface.) The stepping surface of each rung must be not less than 115 mm (4in.) wide and not less than 400 mm (16 in.) long. The distance from the top of one rung to the top of the next must be uniform, between 300 mm (12 in.) and 350 mm (13in.).
