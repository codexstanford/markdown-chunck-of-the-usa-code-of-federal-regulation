###### § 193.10-5 Fire pumps.

(a) Vessels must be equipped with independently driven fire pumps in accordance with Table 193.10-5(a) of this section.

(b) On vessels of 1,000 gross tons or more on an international voyage, each required fire pump, while delivering water through the fire main system at a pressure corresponding to that required by paragraph (c) of this section, must have a minimum capacity of at least two-thirds of that required for an independent bilge pump. However, in no case shall the capacity of each fire pump be less than that otherwise required by this section.

(c) Each pump must be capable of delivering water simultaneously from the outlets having the greatest pressure drop from the fire pumps to the nozzles which may not always be the two highest outlets, at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. Where 1-inch hose is permitted in lieu of 2-inch hose by footnote 2 of Table 193.10-5(a), the pump capacity must be determined on the same basis as if 2-inch hose had been permitted. Where-inch hose is permitted by Table 193.10-5(a), the Pitot tube pressure may not be less than 35 p.s.i.

(d) Fire pumps must be fitted on the discharge side with relief valves set to relieve at 25 p.s.i. in excess of the pressure necessary to maintain the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section or 125 p.s.i., whichever is greater. Relief valves may be omitted if the pumps, operating under shutoff conditions, are not capable of developing a pressure exceeding this amount.

(e) Fire pumps must be fitted with a pressure gage on the discharge side of the pumps.

(f) Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at all times. In no case may a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash must be so arranged that adequate water can be made continuously available for firefighting purposes.

(g) The total area of the pipes leading from a pump must not be less than the discharge area of the pump.

(h) Where two fire pumps are required on vessels with main or auxiliary oil-fired boilers or with internal combustion propulsion machinery, the pumps must be located in separate spaces. The pumps, sea connections, and sources of power must be arranged to ensure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement, the installation of a fixed fire extinguishing system may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire that would affect the powering and operation for the required fire pumps.

(i) Except as provided for in § 193.10-10(e), a sufficient number of hose streams for fire fighting purposes must be immediately available from the fire main at all times by either of the following methods:
