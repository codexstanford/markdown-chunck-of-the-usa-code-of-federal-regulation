###### ยง 151.20-5 Cargo system valving requirements.

For the purpose of adequately controlling the cargo, both under normal operating and casualty conditions, every cargo piping system shall be provided with one of the following sets of control valves and meet the requirements listed below. Cargo tanks, whether gravity or pressure vessel type, for cargoes having a saturated vapor pressure of 10 pounds per square inch gauge or less at 115 &#xB0;F (105 &#xB0;F if the tank is insulated) shall be provided with a valving system designated as Gravity-1. Cargo tanks, whether gravity or pressure vessel type, for cargoes which are carried below ambient temperature and whose vapor pressure is maintained at 10 pounds per square inch gauge or below shall be provided with a valving system designated as Gravity-2. Cargo tanks for cargoes which have vapor pressures above 10 p.s.i.g. at 115 &#xB0;F (105 &#xB0;F if tank is insulated) shall be provided with a valving system designated as Pressure-1. Cargo tanks for cargoes which have vapor pressures above 10 pounds per square inch gauge at 115 &#xB0;F (105 &#xB0;F if tank is insulated) and which require greater protection due to their hazardous characteristics shall be provided with a valving system designated as Pressure-2. The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section for stop valves or excess flow valves to be fitted at tank penetrations are not applicable to nozzles at which pressure vacuum or safety relief valves are fitted.
