##### Subpart 56.20 - Valves
###### ยง 56.20-15 Valves employing resilient material.
####### Category A valves.

(2)The closed valve must pass less than the greater of 5 percent of its fully open flow rate or 15 percent divided by the square root of the nominal pipe size (NPS) of its fully open flow rate through the line after complete removal of all resilient seating material and testing at full rated pressure; as represented by the formula: (15% / SQRT x (NPS)) (Fully open flow rate). Category A valves may be used in any location except where positive shutoff valves are required by ยง 56.50-60(d). Category A valves are required in the following locations:

(i) Valves at vital piping system manifolds;

(ii) Isolation valves in cross-connects between two piping systems, at least one of which is a vital system, where failure of the valve in a fire would prevent the vital system(s) from functioning as designed.

(iii) Valves providing closure for any opening in the shell of the vessel.
