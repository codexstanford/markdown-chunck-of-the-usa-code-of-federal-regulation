#### PART 162-ENGINEERING EQUIPMENT
##### Subpart 162.018-Safety Relief Valves, Liquefied Compressed Gas
###### § 162.018-3 Materials.

(a) The materials used in the manufacture of safety relief valves shall conform to the applicable requirements of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter, except as otherwise specified in this subpart, and shall be resistant to the corrosive or other action of the liquefied compressed gas in the liquid or gas phase.

(b) All pressure containing external parts of valves must be constructed of materials melting above 1700 &#xB0;F. for liquefied flammable gas service. Consideration of lower melting materials for internal pressure-containing parts will be given if their use provides significant improvement to the general operation of the valve. Flange gaskets shall be metal or spiral wound asbestos.

(c) Nonferrous materials shall not be used in the construction of valves for anhydrous ammonia or other service where susceptible to attack by the lading.

(d) The seats and disks shall be of suitable corrosion resistant material. Seats and disks of cast iron or malleable iron shall not be used. Springs shall be of best quality spring steel consistent with the design of the valve and the service requirement.
