####### Subordinated debt considered to be Equity.

(h)With our consent, part of the Equity requirements applicable under paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section may be satisfied by debt, fully subordinated as to the payment of principal and interest on the Secretary's Note and any claims secured as provided for in the Security Agreement or the Mortgage. Repayment of subordinated debt may be made only from funds available for payment of dividends or for other distributions, in accordance with requirements of the Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement (described in ยง 298.35). Such subordinated debt shall not be secured by any interest in property that is security for Guarantees under Title XI, unless the Obligor and the lender enter into a written agreement, satisfactory to us, providing, among other things, that if any Title XI financing or advance by us to the Obligor shall occur in the future, such security interest of the lender shall become subordinated to any indebtedness to us incurred by the Obligor and to any security interest obtained by us in that property or other property, with respect to the subsequent indebtedness.
