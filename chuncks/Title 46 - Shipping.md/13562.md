####### Vessel Position Reports.

(c)All vessels for which war risk insurance interim binders have been issued shall file a Vessel Position Report. The purpose of this report is to inform U.S. agencies of vessel arrivals, departures, and at-sea locations. Failure to make required regular reports will cause MARAD to issue a one-time notice of default. If failure to report continues, MARAD shall cancel the interim binder for the subject vessel and any insurance attaching thereunder. MARAD will issue reporting instructions and formats with the binders.
