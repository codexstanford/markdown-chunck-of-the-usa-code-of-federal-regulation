###### ยง 56.30-5 Welded joints.
####### Butt welds-general.

(b)Butt welds may be made with or without backing or insert rings within the limitations established in ยง 56.70-15. When the use of backing rings will result in undesirable conditions such as severe stress concentrations, corrosion or erosion, then:

(1) The backing rings shall be removed and the inside of the joint ground smooth, or

(2) The joint shall be welded without backing rings, or

(3) Consumable insert rings must be used. Commonly used types of butt welding end preparations are shown in ASME B16.25 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).

(4) Restrictions as to the use of backing rings appear for the low temperature piping systems and should be checked when designing for these systems.
