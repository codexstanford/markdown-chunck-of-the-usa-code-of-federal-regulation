####### Harbor of safe refuge

means a port, inlet, or other body of water normally sheltered from heavy seas by land, and in which a vessel can navigate and safely moor. The suitability of a location as a harbor of safe refuge will be determined by the cognizant OCMI, and varies for each vessel, dependent on the vessel's size, maneuverability, and mooring gear.
