###### § 160.062-3 Materials, construction, workmanship, and performance requirements.
####### General.

(a)The materials, construction, workmanship, and performance requirements shall conform to the requirements of the specifications listed in § 160.062-1(a)(1) except as otherwise provided by this subpart. In addition, all metals and materials used in a hydraulic release must be compatible with each other so that the final assembly under conditions of use is not subject to such deleterious effects as galvanic corrosion, freezing, or buckling of moving parts, or loosening and tightening of joints due to differences in coefficients of thermal expansion. Galvanizing or other forms of metallic coating on the parts of a hydraulic release are not acceptable. The criteria for accepting any combination of materials shall be determined by testing or by the data stated in § 160.062-1(b).
