####### Buoyancy.

(a)Each suit must meet the following buoyancy requirements as measured in the test conducted under § 160.171-17(h):

(1) The adjusted buoyancy of each adult and each oversize adult size suit must be at least 100 N (22 lb.). The adjusted buoyancy of each child size suit must be at least 50 N (11 lb.) The measured buoyancy must not be reduced by more than 5% after 24 hours submersion in fresh water.

(2) Each suit must have a stable floating position in which the wearer's head must be tilted to a position between 30&#xB0; and 80&#xB0; above the horizontal, with the mouth and nose at least 120 mm (4in.) above the surface of the water. If necessary, this position may be obtained through the use of an auxiliary means of buoyancy such as an inflatable bladder behind the wearer's head.

(3) If an auxiliary means of buoyancy is necessary to meet paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the suit must have a stable floating position without the auxiliary means of buoyancy in which the mouth and nose of the wearer are at least 50 mm (2 in.) above the surface of the water.

(4) The buoyancy of any auxiliary means of buoyancy must not be counted when determining the buoyancy of the suit.
