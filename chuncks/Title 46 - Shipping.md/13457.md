####### Notification to Secretary of Defense.

(a)(1) We will provide prompt notice of our receipt of an application for a loan Guarantee for an Eligible Export Vessel to the Secretary of Defense.

(2) During the 30-day period, beginning on the date on which the Secretary of Defense receives such notice, the Secretary of Defense may disapprove the loan guarantee if the Secretary of Defense makes an assessment that the Vessel's potential use may cause harm to United States national security interests.

(3) The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a loan Guarantee under this section solely on the basis of the type of vessel to be constructed with the loan Guarantee. The authority of the Secretary of Defense to disapprove a loan Guarantee under this section may not be delegated to any official other than a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. We will not approve a loan guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense.
