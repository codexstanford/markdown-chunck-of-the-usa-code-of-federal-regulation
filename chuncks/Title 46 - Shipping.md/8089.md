####### Righting (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.5.2).

(5)A reversible one does not need arrangements for righting.

(6) One with a capacity of 13 or more persons must be reversible, with the floor arranged between the buoyancy chambers so that the apparatus can, floating either side up, accommodate the number of persons for which it is approved. One with a capacity of 12 or fewer persons must either be reversible in the same manner, or be designed so that it can be readily righted by one person.

(7) One with a capacity of 25 or more persons must be provided with self-bailing floor drains. If the floor of a reversible one includes one or more drains, each drain must be arranged to completely drain the floor of water when the device is fully loaded, and must prevent water from flowing back onto the floor.

(8) If the buoyancy tubes are not vivid reddish orange, vivid yellow, or a fluorescent color of a similar hue, panels of such hue must be secured to the buoyancy chambers so that a minimum of 1 m(11 ft) is visible from above the apparatus when it is floating either side up.
