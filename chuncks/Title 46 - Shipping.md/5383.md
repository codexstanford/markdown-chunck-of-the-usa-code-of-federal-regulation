###### ยง 111.52-3 Systems below 1500 kilowatts.

The following short-circuit assumptions must be made for a system with an aggregate generating capacity below 1500 kilowatts, unless detailed computations in accordance with ยง 111.52-5 are submitted:

(a) The maximum short-circuit current of a direct current system must be assumed to be 10 times the aggregate normal rated generator currents plus six times the aggregate normal rated currents of all motors that may be in operation.

(b) The maximum asymmetrical short-circuit current for an alternating current system must be assumed to be 10 times the aggregate normal rated generator currents plus four times the aggregate normal rated currents of all motors that may be in operation.

(c) The average asymmetrical short-circuit current for an alternating-current system must be assumed to be 8times the aggregate normal rated generator currents plus 3times the aggregate normal rated currents of all motors that may be in operation.
