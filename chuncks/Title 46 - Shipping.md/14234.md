#### PART 382 - DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE RATES FOR THE CARRIAGE OF BULK AND PACKAGED PREFERENCE CARGOES ON U.S.-FLAG COMMERCIAL VESSELS
##### ยง 382.2 Data submission.
###### General.

(a)The operators shall submit information, described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, to the Director, Office of Costs and Rates, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590. To the extent a vessel is time chartered, the operator shall also submit operating expenses for that vessel. All submissions shall be certified by the operators. A further review based on the independent CPA performing an engagement consistent with professional standards, i.e., an attestation engagement, is recommended. Submissions are subject to verification, at MARAD's discretion, by the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Transportation. MARAD's calculations of the fair and reasonable rates for U.S.-flag vessels shall be performed on the basis of cost data provided by the U.S.-flag vessel operator, as specified herein. If a vessel operator fails to submit the required cost data, MARAD will not construct the guideline rate for the affected vessel, which may result in such vessel not being approved by the sponsoring Federal agency.
