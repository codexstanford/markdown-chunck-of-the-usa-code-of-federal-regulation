###### § 164.008-3 Testing procedure.
####### Temperature observations.

(f)(1) All observations shall be taken at intervals not exceeding 5 minutes. The surface temperatures on the unexposed side of the test specimen shall be measured by thermocouples located as follows:

(i) One thermocouple located approximately in the center of each quadrant of the steel plate (four thermocouples total).

(ii) One thermocouple close to the center of the test specimen, but away from the joint, if any.

(iii) At least one thermocouple at the vertical joint of the test specimen.

(iv) Further thermocouples at the discretion of the testing laboratory or Coast Guard for the purpose of determining the temperature at points deemed likely to give a greater temperature rise than any of the above mentioned thermocouples.

(2) The average temperature rise on the unexposed surface shall be obtained by averaging the readings of the thermocouples mentioned in paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
