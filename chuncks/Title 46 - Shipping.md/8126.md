####### Watertight integrity test.

(f)The buoyant apparatus is submerged for 24 hours at a depth of 3 m (10 ft.) or equivalent water pressure. The final buoyancy of the buoyant apparatus is determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The final buoyancy must be at least 145 N (32 lb.) per person capacity of the buoyant apparatus or 180 N (40 lb.) per person capacity if the apparatus is designed so that persons supported are only partially immersed or if facilities are provided for climbing on top of the apparatus. The loss of buoyancy must not exceed 5 percent of the initial buoyancy. This test is not a required production test if the manufacturer uses the plastic buoyancy foam controls permitted as an alternative to the buoyancy test in paragraph (e) of this section.
