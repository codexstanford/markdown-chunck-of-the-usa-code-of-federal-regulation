####### Universal joints.

(iv)This test is required if the release mechanism employs universal joints to transmit the release power from the control to the hook release. One of each type and size of universal joint must be set up in a jig with the angles of leads set at 0 (zero), 30, and 60 degrees, respectively. A torque of 540 Nm (400 ft lb) must be applied. This torque must be applied with the connecting rod secured beyond the universal and with the lever arm in the horizontal position. There must be no permanent set, or undue stress, as a result of this test.
