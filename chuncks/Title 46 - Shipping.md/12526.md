####### Weekly inspections and tests.

(d)(1) Each survival craft, rescue boat, and launching appliance must be visually inspected to ensure its readiness for use.

(2) Each lifeboat engine and rescue boat engine must be run ahead and astern for a total of not less than 3 minutes unless the ambient temperature is below the minimum temperature required for starting the engine. During this time, demonstrations should indicate that the gear box and gear box train are engaging satisfactorily. If the special characteristics of an outboard motor fitted to a rescue boat would not allow the outboard motor to be run other than with its propeller submerged for a period of 3 minutes, the outboard motor should be run for such period as prescribed in the manufacturer's handbook.

(3) The general alarm system must be tested.
