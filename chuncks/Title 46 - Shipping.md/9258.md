####### Lifeboat seating space test

(iv)(Paragraph 1/6.7). The average mass of persons used to test the lifeboat seating space must be determined by weighing as a group or individually. Each person must wear an inherently buoyant SOLAS lifejacket with at least 150 N of buoyancy or a Coast Guard-approved lifejacket approved under approval series 160.155. For other than a totally enclosed lifeboat, the operator(s) must demonstrate that the lifeboat can be operated while wearing a Coast Guard approved, insulated-buoyant immersion suit approved under approval series 160.171. The Commandant will give consideration to requests to test at, and designate lifeboats for, a heavier occupant weight than that stated in the IMO LSA Code, Chapter IV (incorporated by reference, § 160.135-5 of this subpart).
