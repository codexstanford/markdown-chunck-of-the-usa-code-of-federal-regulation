####### Tests.

(c)Independent fuel tanks must be tested in compliance with the requirements of this part prior to being used to carry fuel.

(1) Prior to installation, tanks vented to the atmosphere must be hydrostatically tested to, and must withstand, a pressure of 35 kPa (5 psig) or 1.5 times the maximum pressure head to which they may be subjected in service, whichever is greater. A standpipe of 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) in height attached to the tank may be filled with water to accomplish the 35 kPa (5 psig) test. Permanent deformation of the tank will not be cause for rejection unless accompanied by leakage.

(2) After installation of the fuel tank on a vessel, the complete installation must be tested in the presence of a marine inspector, or an individual specified by the cognizant OCMI, to a head not less than that to which the tank may be subjected in service. Fuel may be used as the testing medium.

(3) All tanks not vented to the atmosphere must be constructed and tested in accordance with ยง 119.330 of this part.
