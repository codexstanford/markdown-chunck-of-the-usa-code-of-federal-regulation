####### Administrative grace period.

(h)A credential may be renewed up to 12 months after expiration. For a credential to be re-issued by the Coast Guard more than 12 months after its expiration, an applicant must comply with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. When an applicant's credential expires during a time of service with the Armed Forces and there is no reasonable opportunity for renewal, including by mail, this period may be extended. The period of military service following the date of expiration which precluded renewal may be added to the 12-month grace period. The 12-month grace period and any extensions do not affect the expiration date of the credential. A license, MMD, COR, STCW endorsement, MMC, and any endorsements thereon, are not valid for use after the expiration date.
