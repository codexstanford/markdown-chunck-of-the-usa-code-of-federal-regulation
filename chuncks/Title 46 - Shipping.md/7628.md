###### Approval of Surveyors and Handling of Categories A, B, C, and D Cargo and NLS Residue
####### ยง 153.1108 Heated prewash for solidifying NLS, high viscosity NLS and required prewashes of NLS whose viscosity exceeds 25 mPa sec at 20 &#xB0;C: Categories A, B, and C.

(a) When a high viscosity or solidifying cargo is unloaded from a cargo tank, the cargo tank must be prewashed unless ยง 153.1114 or paragraph (c) of this section allows the prewash to be omitted.

(b) When a prewash is required for a tank that has unloaded a solidifying cargo or a cargo having a viscosity exceeding 25 mPa sec at 20 &#xB0;C, the wash water used in the prewash must leave the tank washing machine at a temperature of at least 60 &#xB0;C (140 &#xB0;F).

(c) The prewash required under paragraph (a) of this section may be omitted if the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual contains a procedure for measuring the temperature of all interior cargo tank surfaces throughout unloading and under the measuring procedure the temperature of these surfaces remains above-

(1) The temperature of the cargo's melting point if the cargo is a Category B or C solidifying NLS; or

(2) The temperature at which the cargo's viscosity exceeds-

(i) 25 mPa.s, if the cargo is a high viscosity Category B NLS; or

(ii) 60 mPa.s, if the cargo is a high viscosity Category C NLS.
