####### Plate material.

(a)The manufacturer of plates may certify such material, provided it has been given an appropriate heat-treatment, by reporting the results of tests of one set of Charpy impact specimens or of two drop weight specimens, as applicable, taken from each plate as rolled. Impact specimens shall be taken as outlined in section 12 of ASTM A 20 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 54.01-1). The long axis of the Charpy specimen must be perpendicular to the final direction of rolling. When the direction of maximum stress is unknown, the manufacturer may certify on the basis of specimens taken parallel to the final direction of rolling.
