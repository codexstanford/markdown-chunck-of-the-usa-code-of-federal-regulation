###### ยง 58.25-80 Automatic pilots and ancillary steering gear.

(a) Automatic pilots and ancillary steering gear, and steering-gear control systems, must be arranged to allow immediate resumption of manual operation of the steering-gear control system required in the pilothouse. A switch must be provided, at the primary steering position in the pilothouse, to completely disconnect the automatic equipment from the steering-gear controls.

(b) Automatic pilots and ancillary steering gear must be arranged so that no single failure affects proper operation and independence of the main or auxiliary steering gear, required controls, rudder-angle indicators, or steering-failure alarm.
