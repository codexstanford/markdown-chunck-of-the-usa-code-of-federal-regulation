###### ยง 69.115 Excess hatchway tonnage.

(a) Hatchways that are above the tonnage deck and are either open to the weather or within open structures are measured to determine excess hatchway tonnage. Hatchways that are in between-deck spaces, on decks within closed-in structures, or on open structures are not measured.

(b) The tonnage of a hatchway is its length times breadth times mean depth divided by 100. Mean depth is measured from the under side of the hatch cover to the top of the deck beam.

(c) From the sum of the tonnage of the hatchways under this section, subtract one-half of one percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage exclusive of the hatchway tonnage. The remainder is added as excess hatchway tonnage in calculating the gross register tonnage.
