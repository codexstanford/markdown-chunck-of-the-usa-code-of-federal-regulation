###### ยง 5.59 Offenses for which revocation of credentials or endorsements is mandatory.

An Administrative Law Judge enters an order revoking a respondent's credential or endorsement when-

(a) A charge of misconduct for wrongful possession, use, sale, or association with dangerous drugs is found proved. In those cases involving marijuana, the Administrative Law Judge may enter an order less than revocation when satisfied that the use, possession or association, was the result of experimentation by the respondent and that the respondent has submitted satisfactory evidence that he or she is cured of such use and that the possession or association will not recur.

(b) The respondent has been a user of, or addicted to the use of, a dangerous drug, or has been convicted for a violation of the dangerous drug laws, whether or not further court action is pending, and such charge is found proved. A conviction becomes final when no issue of law or fact determinative of the respondent's guilt remains to be decided.
