####### Sea anchors (IMO LSA Code, as amended by Resolution MSC.293(87), Chapter IV/4.1.5.1.5 and ISO 17339 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.151-5 of this subpart)).

(e)Sea anchors without the swivels may be used if, during the towing test, a sea anchor of their design does not rotate when streamed. The sea anchors need not have the tripping lines if, during the towing test, a sea anchor of their design can be hauled in by one person. Sea anchors must be attached to the raft at a position so as to orient the primary entrance away from the seas as far as practicable while still allowing the sea anchor to be retrieved by a person inside the raft.
