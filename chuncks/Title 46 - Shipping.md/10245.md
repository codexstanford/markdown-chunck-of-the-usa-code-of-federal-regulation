####### Procedure.

(2)Securely attach a spring scale in a position directly over a test tank. Suspend a weighted wire basket from the scale in such a manner that the basket can be weighed while completely submerged in water. Proceed as follows:

(i) Weigh the empty basket under water.

(ii) Place the sample inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. Allow the samples to remain submerged for 24 hours.

(iii) After 24 hours submergence period, weigh the wire basket with the sample inside while both are still under water.

(iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section minus (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The resulting value is divided by the volume of the polyvinyl chloride foam expressed in cubic feet. The final result is in lbs./cu. ft.
