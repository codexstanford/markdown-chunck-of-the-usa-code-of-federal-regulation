##### Subpart C-Subdivision and Damage Stability
###### § 171.080 Damage stability standards for vessels with Type I or Type II subdivision.
####### Damage survival for all new vessels except those vessels authorized to carry more than 12 passengers on an international voyage requiring a SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.

(f)A new vessel is presumed to survive assumed damage if it is shown by calculations to meet the conditions set forth in paragraphs (f) (1) through (7) of this section in the final stage of flooding and to meet the conditions set forth in paragraphs (f) (8) and (9) of this section in each intermediate stage of flooding. For the purposes of establishing boundaries to determine compliance with the requirements in paragraphs (f) (1) through (9), openings that are fitted with weathertight closures and that are not submerged during any stage of flooding will not be considered downflooding points.

(1) Each vessel must have positive righting arms for a minimum range beyond the angle of equilibrium as follows:

(2) No vessel may have any opening through which downflooding can occur within the minimum range specified by paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

(3) Each vessel must have an area under each righting-arm curve of at least 0.015 meter-radians, measured from the angle of equilibrium to the smaller of the following angles:

(i) The angle at which downflooding occurs.

(ii) The angle of vanishing stability.

(4) Except as provided by paragraph (f)(5) of this section, each vessel must have within the positive range the greater of a righting arm (GZ) equal to or greater than 0.10 meter or a GZ as calculated using the formula:

(i) The passenger heeling moment is calculated using the formula:

(ii) The heeling moment due to asymmetric escape routes for passengers, if the vessel has asymmetric escape routes for passengers, is calculated assuming that-

(A) The weight of each passenger is the weight used for calculations as determined in accordance with § 170.090(c) of this chapter;

(B) Each passenger occupies 0.25 square meter of deck area; and

(C) All passengers are distributed, on available deck areas unoccupied by permanently affixed objects, toward one side of the vessel on the decks where passengers would move to escape from the vessel in case of flooding, so that they produce the most adverse heeling moment.

(iii) The heeling moment due to the launching of survival craft is calculated assuming that-

(A) All survival craft, including davit-launched liferafts and rescue boats, fitted on the side to which the vessel heels after sustained damage, are swung out if necessary, fully loaded and ready for lowering;

(B) Persons not in the survival craft swung out and ready for lowering are distributed about the centerline of the vessel so that they do not provide additional heeling or righting moments; and

(C) Survival craft on the side of the vessel opposite that to which the vessel heels remain stowed.

(iv) The heeling moment due to wind pressure is calculated assuming that-

(A) The wind exerts a pressure of 120 Newtons per square meter;

(B) The wind acts on an area equal to the projected lateral area of the vessel above the waterline corresponding to the intact condition; and

(C) The lever arm of the wind is the vertical distance from a point at one-half the mean draft, or the center of area below the waterline, to the center of the lateral area.

(5) Each vessel whose arrangements do not generally allow port or starboard egress may be exempted, by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, from the transverse passenger heeling moment required by paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. Each vessel exempted must have sufficient longitudinal stability to prevent immersion of the deck edge during forward or aft egress.

(6) Each vessel must have an angle of equilibrium that does not exceed-

(i) 7 degrees for flooding of one compartment;

(ii) 12 degrees for flooding of two compartments; or

(iii) A maximum of 15 degrees for flooding of one or two compartments where-

(A) The vessel has positive righting arms for at least 20 degrees beyond the angle of equilibrium; and

(B) The vessel has an area under each righting-arm curve, when the equilibrium angle is between 7 degrees and 15 degrees, in accordance with the formula:
