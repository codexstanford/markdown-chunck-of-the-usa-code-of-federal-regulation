####### Castings.

(e)(1) The manufacturer of castings may certify them by reporting the results of one set of Charpy impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, taken from each 5 short tons of product from each melting furnace heat. These specimens shall be taken either directly from a production casting or from test coupons cast attached thereto provided the additional requirements in this paragraph are met.

(2) One set of Charpy impact or two drop-weight specimens may represent all castings (up to 5 short tons) that are from the same heat of material and that have a thickness that does not differ from the thickness of the section from which the specimens were taken by more than plus or minus 25 percent, or 1inches, whichever is less. A wider range of thicknesses from one heat may be covered by taking additional sets of specimens from thicker or thinner material as may be required.

(3) The test specimens shall be heat-treated in the same manner as the castings represented, which heat-treatment of specimens may be carried out in the furnace with the castings represented, or separately, but if carried out separately both heat-treatments shall be done in automatically controlled furnaces equipped with calibrated recording pyrometers, the certified records of which shall be made available to the marine inspector.
