####### Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 12.

(12)High-hub bronze flanges may be used for temperatures not exceeding 425 &#xB0;F. The hub of the flange must be bored to a depth not less than that required for a threaded connection of the same diameter leaving a shoulder for the pipe to butt against. A preinserted ring of silver brazing alloy having a melting point not less than 1,000 &#xB0;F and of sufficient quantity to fill the annular clearance between the flange and the pipe must be inserted in the groove. The pipe must then be inserted in the flange and sufficient heat applied externally to melt the brazing alloy until it completely fills the clearance between the hub and the flange of the pipe. A suitable flux must be applied to the surfaces to be joined to produce a satisfactory joint.
