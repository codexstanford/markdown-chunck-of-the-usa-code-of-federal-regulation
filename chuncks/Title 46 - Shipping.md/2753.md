(a) Only marine inspectors shall apply the Coast Guard Symbol. They will not apply any other code symbol to pressure vessels.

(b) All pressure vessels not exempted under provisions of § 54.01-15 shall be inspected by a marine inspector referring to procedures outlined in UG-92 through UG-103 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) and §§ 50.30-10, 50.30-15, and 50.30-20 of this subchapter. The marine inspector will then stamp the vessel with the Coast Guard Symbol.

(c) Pressure vessels described in § 54.01-5(c)(3), except pressure vessels in systems regulated under § 58.60 of this chapter, must be visually examined by a marine inspector prior to installation. The marine inspector also reviews the associated plans and manufacturers' data reports. If, upon inspection, the pressure vessel complies with the applicable requirements in § 54.01-5, the marine inspector stamps the pressure vessel with the Coast Guard Symbol.
