####### Seagoing condition

means the operating condition of the unit with the personnel, equipment, fluids, and ballast necessary for safe operation on the waters where the unit operates. For bottom-bearing mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), the term also applies in the bottom-bearing mode, but the lightest seagoing condition is considered to be the highest anticipated operating condition.
