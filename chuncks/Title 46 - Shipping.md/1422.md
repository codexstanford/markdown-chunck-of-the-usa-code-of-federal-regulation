####### Survival conditions.

(f)A vessel is presumed to survive the assumed damage and unintentional flooding described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if:

(1) The angle of equilibrium after flooding does not exceed 25&#xB0; (0.44 radians); and

(2) Through an angle of 20&#xB0; (0.35 radians) beyond the angle of equilibrium after flooding, the following are met-

(i) The righting arm curve is positive;

(ii) The maximum righting arm is at least 4 inches (102 millimeters);

(iii) Each submerged opening is capable of being made weathertight; and

(iv) The heeling arm caused by deploying all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side of a vessel does not exceed the righting arm at any angle of heel beyond the equilibrium angle when launching is assumed on the damaged side.
