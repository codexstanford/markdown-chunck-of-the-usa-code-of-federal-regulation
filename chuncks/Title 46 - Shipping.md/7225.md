() Heaving/80 half amplitude (/20 full cycle) in 8 seconds.

(iv) The hull structure and saddle support system shall be analyzed, using the maximum hull bending moments and saddle reactions obtained from the foregoing. Bending stress shall not exceed 60 percent of the yield strength or 42 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the material, whichever is less. Critical buckling strength shall be at least 75 percent greater than calculated buckling stresses. The maximum tank bending moments and saddle reactions shall be used in the tank design calculations required by ยง 151.15-3(b)(8).
