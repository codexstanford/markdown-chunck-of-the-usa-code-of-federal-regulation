######## Closing report.

(a)(1) The assured shall file with the underwriting agent, not later than the twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month, a closing report for all inward shipments and a closing report for all outward shipments, and pay the premium and fees, for all shipments covered during the preceding calendar month, as required by Clause 19. Each closing report shall be filed in duplicate on Form MA-313, prescribed in ยง 308.533, supported by a certificate executed by the assured on Form MA-313-A, prescribed in ยง 308.534. If the assured has no shipments to report during any calendar month, the closing report, Form MA-313, shall, nevertheless, be filed with one or both of the following statements, depending upon their applicability, noted thereon certifying that:

(i) No inward shipment coming within the scope of this policy arrived at destination during the preceding calendar month, and that during the preceding calendar month no knowledge has come to the assured of an inward shipment covered under the terms of the policy which will not arrive by reason of loss, frustration or other similar cause,

(ii) No outward shipment coming within the scope of this policy was made during the preceding calendar month, and

(iii) Whenever a sea passage is made with respect to cargo covered under the policy by a barge or sailing vessel the assured shall note that fact upon the closing report, unless the Maritime Administrator otherwise agrees.

(2) An assured reporting for one calendar month shall not include therein a report of a shipment due to be reported in the report for the next succeeding calendar month. Thus, the report of January closing shipments filed in February does not include February closings.
