####### General.

(a)Each survival craft must be stowed-

(1) As close to the accommodation and service spaces as possible;

(2) So that neither the survival craft nor its stowage arrangements will interfere with the embarkation and operation of any other survival craft or rescue boat at any other launching station;

(3) As near the water surface as is safe and practicable;

(4) Except for liferafts intended for throw-overboard launching, not less than 2 meters above the waterline with the vessel-

(i) In the fully loaded condition;

(ii) Under unfavorable conditions of trim; and

(iii) Listed up to 20 degrees either way, or to the angle at which the vessel's weatherdeck edge becomes submerged, whichever is less.

(5) Sufficiently ready for use so that two crew members can complete preparations for embarkation and launching in less than 5 minutes;

(6) In a secure and sheltered position and protected from damage by fire and explosion, as far as practicable; and

(7) So as not to require lifting from its stowed position in order to launch, except that-

(i) A davit-launched liferaft may be lifted by a manually powered winch from its stowed position to its embarkation position; or

(ii) A survival craft that weights 185 kilograms (407.8 pounds) or less may be lifted not more than 300 millimeters (1 foot) in order to launch.
