This Formal Measurement System is based on the rules of the Standard Regulatory Measurement System, with adjustments that allow for the assignment of two sets of Regulatory Measurement System tonnages whose use depends on the loading condition of the vessel. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).
