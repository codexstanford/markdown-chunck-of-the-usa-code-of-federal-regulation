####### Fixed seating criterion.

(3)One passenger may be permitted for each 455 millimeter (18 inches) of width of fixed seating provided by ยง 116.820 of this chapter. Each sleeping berth in overnight accommodation spaces shall be counted as only one seat.

(c) Different passenger capacity criteria may be used on each deck of a vessel and added together to determine the total passenger capacity of that vessel. Where seats are provided on part of a deck and not on another, the number of passengers permitted on a vessel may be the sum of the number permitted by the seating criterion for the space having seats and the number permitted by the deck area criterion for the space having no seats. The length of rail criterion may not be combined with either the deck area criterion or the fixed seating criterion when determining the maximum number of passengers permitted on an individual deck.

(d) For a vessel operating on short runs on protected waters such as a ferry, the cognizant OCMI may give special consideration to increases in passenger allowances.
