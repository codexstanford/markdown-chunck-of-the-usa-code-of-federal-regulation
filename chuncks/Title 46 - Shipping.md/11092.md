###### § 172.065 Damage stability.
####### Character of damage.

(d)(1) If a tank vessel is longer than 738 feet (225 meters) in length, design calculations must show that it can survive damage at any location.

(2) If a tank vessel is longer than 492 feet (150 meters) in length, but not longer than 738 feet (225 meters), design calculations must show that it can survive damage at any location except the transverse bulkheads bounding an aft machinery space. The machinery space is calculated as a single floodable compartment.

(3) If a tank vessel is 492 feet (150 meters) or less in length, design calculations must show that it can survive damage-

(i) At any location between adjacent main transverse watertight bulkheads except to an aft machinery space;

(ii) To a main transverse watertight bulkhead spaced closer than the longitudinal extent of collision penetration specified in Table 172.065(a) from another main transverse watertight bulkhead; and

(iii) To a main transverse watertight bulkhead or a transverse watertight bulkhead bounding a side tank or double bottom tank if there is a step or a recess in the transverse bulkhead that is longer than 10 feet (3.05 meters) and that is located within the extent of penetration of assumed damage. The step formed by the after peak bulkhead and after peak tank top is not a step for the purpose of this regulation.
