####### Standard Regulatory Measurement System

means the measurement system under subpart C of this part, which is one of three sub-systems of the Regulatory Measurement System. This Formal Measurement System is based on the rules of the British Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 and uses volumes of internal spaces as the principal inputs for tonnage calculations, allowing for exemptions or deductions of qualifying spaces according to their location and use. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).
