####### Butt welds (reproduces 127.3),End preparation.

(a)-(1)(i) Oxygen or arc cutting is acceptable only if the cut is reasonably smooth and true, and all slag is cleaned from the flame cut surfaces. Discoloration which may remain on the flame cut surface is not considered to be detrimental oxidation.

(ii) Butt-welding end preparation dimensions contained in ASME B16.25 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) or any other end preparation that meets the procedure qualification requirements are acceptable.

(iii) If piping component ends are bored, such boring shall not result in the finished wall thickness after welding being less than the minimum design thickness. Where necessary, weld metal of the appropriate analysis may be deposited on the inside or outside of the piping component to provide sufficient material for machining to insure satisfactory fitting of rings.

(iv) If the piping component ends are upset they may be bored to allow for a completely recessed backing ring, provided the remaining net thickness of the finished ends is not less than the minimum design thickness.
