(1) Each survival craft must be stowed as close to the accommodation and service spaces as possible.

(2) Each survival craft must be stowed in a way that neither the survival craft nor its stowage arrangements will interfere with the embarkation and operation of any other survival craft or rescue boat at any other launching station.

(3) Each survival craft must be stowed as near the water surface as is safe and practicable.

(4) Each survival craft must be stowed where the survival craft, in the embarkation position, is above the waterline with the unit-

(i) In the fully loaded condition; and

(ii) Listed up to 20 degrees either way, or to the angle where the unit's weatherdeck edge becomes submerged, whichever is less.

(5) Each survival craft must be sufficiently ready for use so that two crew members can complete preparations for embarkation and launching in less than 5 minutes.

(6) Each survival craft must be fully equipped as required under this subpart.

(7) Each survival craft must be in a secure and sheltered position and protected from damage by fire and explosion, as far as practicable.

(8) Each survival craft must not require lifting from its stowed position in order to launch, except that a davit-launched liferaft may be lifted by a manually powered winch from its stowed position to its embarkation position.
