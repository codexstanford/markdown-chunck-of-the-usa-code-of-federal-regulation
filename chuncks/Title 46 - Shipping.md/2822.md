###### ยง 56.07-10 Design conditions and criteria (modifies 101-104.7).
####### Pressure design (modifies 102.3, 104.1.2, and 104.4).

(e)(1) Materials for use in piping must be selected as described in ยง 56.60-1(a) of this part. Tabulated values of allowable stress for these materials must be measured as indicated in 102.3.1 of ASME B31.1 and in tables 56.60-1 and 56.60-2(a) of this part.

(2) Allowable stress values, as found in the ASME Code, which are restricted in application by footnote or are italicized shall not be used. Where multiple stresses are listed for a material, the lowest value of the listing shall be used unless otherwise approved by the Commandant. In all cases the temperature is understood to be the actual temperature of the component.

(3) Where the operator desires to use a material not listed, permission must be obtained from the Commandant. Requirements for testing found in ยง 56.97-40(a)(2) and ยง 56.97-40(a)(4) may affect design and should be considered. Special design limitations may be found for specific systems. Refer to subpart 56.50 for specific requirements.
