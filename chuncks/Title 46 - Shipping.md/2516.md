###### ยง 50.25-7 Testing of products required to be certified in presence of marine inspector.

(a) Certified products are not normally tested in the presence of a marine inspector. The Commandant may, however, assign a marine inspector to witness tests required by the applicable specifications to satisfy himself that the requirements are met.

(b) Marine inspectors shall have free entry at all times to those parts of the plant where material subject to the regulations in this subchapter is being manufactured. The manufacturer shall provide marine inspectors all reasonable facilities to satisfy them that the material is being manufactured in accordance with the requirements of the Commandant.

(c) Unless otherwise authorized, required tests and inspections described in applicable specifications shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to shipment. Unless otherwise specified, tests shall be performed at room temperature. These tests when performed in the presence of a marine inspector will be so conducted as not to interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the plant.

(d) Marine inspectors shall assure themselves that test specimens are marked for positive identification with the materials which they represent.
