####### Molded depth.

(e)(1) The molded depth is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side. In wood and composite vessels the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.

(2) In vessels having rounded gunwales, the molded depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the molded lines of the deck and sides, the lines extending as though the gunwale were of angular design.

(3) Where the freeboard deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the molded depth is to be determined, the molded depth shall be measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part.
