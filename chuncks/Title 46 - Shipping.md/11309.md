#### PART 175-GENERAL PROVISIONS
##### § 175.400 Definitions of terms used in this subchapter.
###### High speed craft

means a craft that is operable on or above the water and has characteristics so different from those of conventional displacement ships, to which the existing international conventions, particularly SOLAS, apply, that alternative measures should be used to achieve an equivalent level of safety. In order to be considered a high speed craft, the craft must be capable of a maximum speed equal to or exceeding V = 3.7 x displ, where "V" is the maximum speed and "displ" is the vessel displacement corresponding to the design waterline in cubic meters.
