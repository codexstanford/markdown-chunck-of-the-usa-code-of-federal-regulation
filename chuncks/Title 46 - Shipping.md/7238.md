####### High density cargo.

(c)Cargoes with a specific gravity greater than that for which the scantlings of the tank are designed may be carried provided that:

(1) The maximum cargo weight (tons) in a specific tank does not exceed the maximum cargo weight (tons) endorsed on the certificate of inspection.

(2) The scantlings of the tank are sufficient to prevent rupture under a full head of the higher density cargo. Scantlings meeting ordinary bulkhead requirements for the full head will satisfy this requirement.
