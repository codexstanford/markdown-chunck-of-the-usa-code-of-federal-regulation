####### Method for measuring deductible spaces.

(q)(1) A rectangular space must be measured by taking the product of its length, breadth, and height.

(2) A space with curved sides on or above the tonnage deck is measured according to ยง 69.109.

(3) Space less than 15 feet in length may be measured by any practical method.

(4) Spaces below the tonnage deck exceeding 15 feet in length and bounded by a curved surface conforming to the side of the vessel must be measured by the formula used for measuring the superstructure under ยง 69.113.

(5) The height of a space located on a platform in the hull must be measured from the top of the bottom hull frames, if the platform is used only to form a flat surface at the bottom of the space, if the platform is not more than one foot above the top of the bottom frames, and if the space below the platform is not usable.

(6) The height of a space is measured through any ceiling, paneling, false overhead, or other covering, to the space's structural boundary, unless the space enclosed by the covering is available for a non-deductible use.
