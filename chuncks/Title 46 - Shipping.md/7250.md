####### Safety relief venting.

(c)A closed venting system fitted with a device to automatically limit the pressure in the tank to below its maximum allowable working pressure. The maximum safety relief valve setting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the tank. For cargoes carried at ambient temperatures, the minimum safety relief valve setting shall correspond to the saturated vapor pressure of the cargo at 105 &#xB0;F if carried in an insulated tank, or 115 &#xB0;F if carried in an uninsulated tank. For cargoes carried below ambient temperature, the safety relief valve setting shall be selected to provide a suitable margin between normal operating pressure of the tank and the opening pressure of the valve but in no case shall it exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the tank. The safety relief valves shall be of a type approved under subparts 162.001 or 162.018 of subchapter Q of this chapter. The required capacity of the safety relief valves shall be in accordance with the requirements of part 54 of this chapter.
