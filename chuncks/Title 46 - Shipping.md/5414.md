####### Low-voltage release.

(b)Each motor controller for a fire pump, elevator, steering gear, or auxiliary that is vital to the vessel's propulsion system, except a motor controller for a vital propulsion auxiliary which can be restarted from a central control station, must have low-voltage release if automatic restart after a voltage failure or its resumption to operation is not hazardous. If automatic restart is hazardous, the motor controller must have low-voltage protection. Motor controllers for other motors must not have low-voltage release unless the starting current and the short-time sustained current of the additional low-voltage release load is within the capacity of one ship's service generator. Automatic sequential starting of low-voltage release controllers is acceptable to meet this paragraph.
