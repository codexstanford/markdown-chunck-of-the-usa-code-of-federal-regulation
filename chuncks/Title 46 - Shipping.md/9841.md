###### § 161.012-17 Instructions.

(a) Each light must have instructions on how to attach it to a PFD in a manner that complies with § 161.012-7(a). However, in the case of lights that are to be attached by a PFD manufacturer, only one set of instructions need be provided for each shipment of lights.

(b) If a light is designed to be attached to a finished PFD, any attachment materials that are not supplied with the light must be clearly identified in the instructions. If a light is to be attached to a finished PFD by a PFD purchaser, any attachment materials not supplied with the light must be generally available for purchase.

(c) Each set of instructions must-(1) Clearly identify the kind of PFD construction (for example fabric covered or vinyl dipped) to which the light can be attached; and

(2) Not require penetration of the buoyant material of the PFD.
