####### Pontoon covers.

(d)(1) Where pontoon covers used in place of portable beams and covers are made of mild steel the strength shall be calculated with the assumed loads given in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and the product of the maximum stress thus calculated and the factor 5 shall not exceed the minimum ultimate strength of the material. They shall be so designed as to limit the deflection to not more than 0.0022 times the span. Mild steel plating forming the tops of covers shall be not less in thickness than 1 percent of the spacing of stiffeners or 0.24 inches if that be greater. For vessels of not more than 328 feet in length the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section are applicable.

(2) The strength and stiffness of covers made of materials other than mild steel shall be equivalent to those of mild steel to the satisfaction of the assigning authority.
