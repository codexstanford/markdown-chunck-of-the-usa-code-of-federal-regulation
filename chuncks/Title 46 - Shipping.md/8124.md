####### Beam loading test.

(2)The buoyant apparatus must be stood on edge on one of its longer sides. A wood block 600 mm (24 in.) long and wide enough to cover the body of the apparatus must be centered on the top edge of the apparatus. A loading beam must be set at right angles to the float at a height so that the beam is in a horizontal position with its center on the center of the wood block. The loading beam must be hinged at one end and a load applied at the other end at a uniform rate of 225 kg (500 lb.) per minute until the load at the end of the beam as shown on Table 160.010-7(d)(2) is reached. The beam is then held stationary for 10 minutes. The device used to apply the load must be a chain fall, hydraulic cylinder or other device that allows the device to unload as the strain on the buoyant apparatus relieves. At the end of the 10 minute period, the drop in the load on the device must not exceed the maximum permissible drop shown in Table 160.010-7(d)(2). If the buoyant apparatus is not one of the sizes listed in the table, the loads must be determined by linear interpolation.
