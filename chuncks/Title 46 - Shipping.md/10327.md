####### Loop breaking strength.

(3)The thread, as received, must have a loop breaking strength of not less than 45 N (10.0 lb.), when tested in accordance with Test Method 4100 in Federal Test Method Standard No. 191A using a CRT testing machine, except that-

(i) Each specimen must consist of two 35 cm (14 in.) pieces of thread; and

(ii) Both ends of one piece of thread must be secured without twisting in one clamp of the testing machine so that the length of the loop formed equals one half the distance between the clamps. One end of the second piece must then be passed without twisting through the loop formed by the first, and both ends must be secured in the other clamp of the machine. The breaking strength must then be determined under the single strand test.
