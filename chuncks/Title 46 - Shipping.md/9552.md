###### § 160.171-17 Approval testing for adult size immersion suit.
####### Swimming and water emergence test.

(7)A pool with an inflatable liferaft at one side must be used for this test. The liferaft must be of a type approved under Subpart 160.051 of this Chapter and must not have a boarding ramp. Each subject, wearing a life preserver but not the immersion suit, enters the water and swims 25 m. The subject must then be able to emerge from the pool onto the liferaft using only the hands placed on top of the liferaft as an aid and without pushing off of the bottom of the pool. Any subject unable to emerge onto the liferaft within 30 seconds is disqualified for this test. At least five subjects must qualify and be used for this test. If less than five subjects of the original ten qualify, substitute subjects must be used. Each qualified subject, after sufficient rest to avoid fatigue, repeats this test wearing an immersion suit instead of the life preserver. At least two-thirds of the qualified subjects must be able to swim this distance, and emerge onto the liferaft within 30 seconds, wearing the immersion suit.
