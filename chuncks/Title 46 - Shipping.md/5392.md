(a) Each marine shipboard cable must meet all the requirements for construction and identification of either IEEE 1580, UL 1309, IEC 60092-353, or NPFC MIL-C-24640A or NPFC MIL-C-24643A (all five standards incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1), including the respective flammability tests contained therein, and must be of a copper-stranded type.

(b) Each cable constructed to IEC 60092-353 must meet the flammability requirements of Category A of IEC 60332-3-22 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1).

(c) Medium-voltage electric cable must meet the requirements of IEEE 1580 and UL 1072 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1), where applicable, for cables rated above 5,000 volts.

(d) Electrical cable that has a polyvinyl-chloride insulation with a nylon jacket (Type T/N) must meet either UL 1309, IEEE 1580, or section 8 of IEEE 45-2002 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1).
