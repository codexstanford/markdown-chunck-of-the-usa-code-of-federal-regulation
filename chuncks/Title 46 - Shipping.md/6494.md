(b)Each marine evacuation system must be stowed as follows:

(1) There must not be any openings between the marine evacuation system's embarkation station and the OSV's side at the OSV's waterline in the lightest seagoing condition.

(2) The marine evacuation system's launching positions must be arranged, as far as practicable, to be straight down the OSV's side and safely clear the propeller and any steeply overhanging positions of the hull.

(3) The marine evacuation system must be protected from any projections of the OSV's structure or equipment.

(4) The marine evacuation system's passage and platform, when deployed; its stowage container; and its operational arrangement must not interfere with the operation of any other lifesaving appliance at any other launching station.

(5) Where appropriate, the marine evacuation system's stowage area must be protected from damage by heavy seas.
