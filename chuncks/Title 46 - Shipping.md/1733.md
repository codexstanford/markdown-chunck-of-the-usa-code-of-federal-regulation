###### ยง 32.63-20 Hull structure - B/ALL.
####### Types I and II barge hull.

(b)Under an assumed grounding condition such that the forward rake bulkhead rests upon a pinnacle at the water surface, the maximum hull bending stress shall not exceed the following limits:

(1) Independent tanks may be installed in such a manner that they do not contribute to the strength and stiffness of the barge. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed either 50 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the material or 70 percent of the yield strength when specified, whichever is greater.

(2) The Commandant may consider a reduction in hull stress when independent tanks are installed in such a manner as to contribute to the strength and stiffness of the barge and this is accounted for in determining the effective section modulus of the barge. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed the percentage stress values prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by the quantity (1.5-SWT/UTS), where SWT is the stress calculated without including the effect of the tanks, and UTS is the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the material. The value SWT, however, shall in no case be more than 75 percent of UTS.
