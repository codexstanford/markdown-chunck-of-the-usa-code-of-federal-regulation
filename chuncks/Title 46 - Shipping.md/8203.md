####### Watertightness test for containers.

(b)Whenever a question arises as to the watertightness of a container, the following test may be made to determine whether it is satisfactory in this respect. Open the container, remove the contents, insert colored blotting paper as a lining, re-close container as tightly as possible by hand (no wrenches or special tools permitted), submerge container with top about 30 cm (1 ft.) below the surface of the water for two hours, remove container from water, wipe off excess moisture on outside, then open the container and examine the blotting paper and entire interior for evidence of moisture penetration. If any moisture or water is evidenced, the container is not satisfactory.
