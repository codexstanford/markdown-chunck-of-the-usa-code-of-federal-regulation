###### § 164.018-11 Approval tests.
####### Resistance to water immersion.

(1)Two test panels are used. The test panels and test conditions must meet paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. The retroreflective material on each test panel is cut with a sharp knife from each corner to the corner diagonally opposite so that an "X" is formed. The cuts must be made completely through the material to the metal panel. One panel is immersed in distilled water in a covered container. The other panel is immersed in salt water (4% NaCl by weight) in a covered container. After 16 hours in water, the panels are removed from the containers, rinsed of deposits, and dried. Reflective intensity values at the angles listed in Table 164.018-9 must be measured within 2 hours after removal of the panels from the water. When measuring the reflective intensity values, the area within 5 mm (0.2 in.) of either side of the "X" cuts, and within 5 mm of the cut edges of the material, must not be counted.
