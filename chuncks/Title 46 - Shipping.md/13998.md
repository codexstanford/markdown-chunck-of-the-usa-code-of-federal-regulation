##### Sec. 2 Use of contract for competitive bid and negotiated price awards.
###### Extra items of work found subsequent to the awarding of the work covered by the original specifications.

(3)Where extra items of work are required after the commencement of the awarded work, it is permissible to negotiate with the contractor who is performing the awarded work, for the accomplishment of such extra work under the provisions of Article 6 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract. A discussion of this procedure is set out in section 8 of this order. However, where items of extra work are found after examinations have been made as called for by the original specifications, negotiation with the contractor to perform such items of extra work shall be permitted only if the aggregate estimated cost of such items of extra work would not amount to a substantial part of the entire job. If the items of extra work amount to a substantial part of the entire job, they shall be awarded in the same manner and after consideration of the same factors as are set forth above for awarding original work.
