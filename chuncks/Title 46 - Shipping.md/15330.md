###### ยง 503.55 Derivative classification.
####### Classification authority.

(1)The authority for classification shall be shown as follows:

(i) "Classified by (description of source documents or classification guide)," or

(ii) "Classified by multiple sources," if a document is classified on the basis of more than one source document or classification guide.

(iii) In these cases, the derivative classifier shall maintain the identification of each source with the file or record copy of the derivatively classified document. A document derivatively classified on the basis of a source document that is marked "Classified by Multiple Sources" shall cite the source document in its "Classified by" line rather than the term "Multiple sources."
