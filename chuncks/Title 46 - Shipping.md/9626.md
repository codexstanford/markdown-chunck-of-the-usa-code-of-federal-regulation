####### Tear resistance.

(i)The tear resistance of the material from which a thermal protective aid is constructed must be determined by the method described in ASTM D 1004 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.174-3). If more than one material is used, each material must be tested. If varying thicknesses of a material are used in the aid, samples representing the thinnest portion of the material must be tested. If multiple layers of a material are used in the aid, samples representing the layer on the exterior of the aid must be tested. Any material that is a composite formed of two or more materials bonded together is considered to be a single material. The average tearing strength of each material must be at least 45 Newtons (10 lb).
