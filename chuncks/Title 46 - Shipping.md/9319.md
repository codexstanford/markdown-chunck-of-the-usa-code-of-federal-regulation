###### § 160.151-15 Design and performance of inflatable liferafts.
####### Containers (IMO LSA Code, as amended by Resolution MSC.293(87), Chapter IV/4.2.6.1).

(p)Each container for packing liferafts-

(1) Must include a telltale made with a seal-and-wire, or equivalent, method for indicating whether the liferaft has been tampered with or used since packing;

(2) Must be designed so that the liferaft breaks free of the container when inflation is initiated, without the need to manually open or remove any closing arrangement;

(3) Must have an interior surface smooth and free from splinters, barbs, or rough projections;

(4) Must be of rigid construction where the liferaft is intended for float-free launching or for exposed stowage on deck;

(5) If rigid, must be designed to facilitate securing the inflatable liferaft to a vessel to permit quick release for manual launching;

(6) If constructed of fibrous-glass-reinforced plastic, must be provided with a means to prevent abrasion of the liferaft fabric, such as by using a gel-coated interior finish of the container, enclosing the liferaft in an envelope of plastic film, or equivalent means; and

(7) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(4) of this section, may be of fabric construction. Each container of fabric construction must be made of coated cloth, include carrying handles and drain holes, and be adaptable to stowage and expeditious removal from lockers and deck-mounted enclosures adjacent to liferaft-launching stations. The weight of a liferaft in a fabric container including its container and equipment may not exceed 100 kg (220 lb).
