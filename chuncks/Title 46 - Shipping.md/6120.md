(a) Complete but simple instructions for the operation of a fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be located in a conspicuous place at or near each pull box and stop valve control and in the space where the extinguishing agent cylinders are stored. If the storage cylinders are separate from the protected space, the instructions must also include a schematic diagram of the system and instructions detailing alternate methods of releasing the extinguishing agent should the local manual release or stop valve controls fail to operate. Each control valve to a distribution line must be marked to indicate the space served.

(b) An alarm for a fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be clearly and conspicuously marked "WHEN ALARM SOUNDS-VACATE AT ONCE. CARBON DIOXIDE BEING RELEASED." Where a different extinguishing agent is installed, that agent shall be marked in place of "carbon dioxide."

(c) Each distribution line valve of a fixed gas fire extinguishing system and the fire main, must be plainly, conspicuously, and permanently marked indicating the space served.

(d) A manual fire alarm pull station must be conspicuously marked as such in clearly legible letters, and include brief, clear instructions for operation.

(e) An indicator for a fire detection and alarm system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters "FIRE ALARM".

(f) An alarm for an automatic sprinkler system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters "SPRINKLER ALARM".

(g) A control cabinet or space containing valves, manifolds, or controls for any fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters "CARBON DIOXIDE FIRE EXTINGUISHING APPARATUS", or as otherwise required by the OCMI. Where a different extinguishing agent is installed, that agent must be marked in place of "carbon dioxide."
