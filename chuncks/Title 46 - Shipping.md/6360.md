####### Rough weather at sea, crossing of hazardous bars, or flooding.

(a)(1) Close each watertight and weathertight door, hatch, and air-port to prevent taking water aboard or further flooding in the vessel.

(2) Keep bilges dry to prevent loss of stability from water in bilges. Use power-driven bilge pump, hand pump, and buckets to dewater.

(3) Align fire pumps to serve as bilge pumps if possible.

(4) Check, for leakage, each intake and discharge line that penetrates the hull.

(5) Offshore workers remain seated and evenly distributed.

(6) Offshore workers don immersion suits (if required aboard) or lifejackets if the going becomes very rough, if the vessel is about to cross a hazardous bar, if flooding begins, or when ordered to by the master.

(7) Never abandon the vessel unless actually forced to, or ordered to by the master.

(8) Prepare survival craft-life floats, (inflatable) rafts, (inflatable) buoyant apparatus, and boats-for launching.
