####### Test No. 6 Air Entrainment Test.

(g)(1) The meter is fed with a 15 ppm mixture until a steady oil content reading is obtained and recorded.

(2) Air is injected into the meter test rig before the sample pump or, in the absence of such pump, immediately before any conditioning unit used to prepare the mixture for measurement. Injection must be by needle having an orifice dimension not exceeding 0.5 mm in diameter arranged in line with the sample flow. The quantity of air injected must be 1 percent of the designated flow rate of the sample pump or conditioning unit at the point of injection.

(3) Air must be delivered to the system by direct injection or pump via a suitable measuring device designed to permit a constant controllable flow rate within +/-10 percent of the required rate of injection for an uninterrupted effective test period of not less than 15 minutes.

(4) The oil content reading, when steady, is recorded.
