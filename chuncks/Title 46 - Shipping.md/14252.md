###### Return on working capital.

(3)For each voyage a return on working capital shall be included as a voyage related capital cost element, and thus not part of the averaged costs. Working capital shall equal the dollar amount necessary to cover 100 percent of the averaged operating costs and estimated voyage costs for the voyage. The rate of return shall be based on an average of the most recent return of stockholders' equity for a cross section of transportation companies, including maritime companies.
