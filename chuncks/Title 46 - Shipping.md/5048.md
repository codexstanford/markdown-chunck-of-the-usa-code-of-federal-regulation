(ii) Each lifebuoy must not be permanently secured to the unit in anyway.

(iii) Lifebuoys must be so distributed as to be readily available on each side of the unit and, as far as practicable, on each open deck extending to the side of the unit. The lifebuoys with attached self-igniting lights must be evenly distributed on all sides of the unit.

(iv) At least two lifebuoys, each with attached self-activating smoke signals, must be stowed where they can be quickly released from the navigating bridge or main control station, or a location readily available to personnel on board. These lifebuoys should, when released, fall directly into the water without striking any part of the unit.
