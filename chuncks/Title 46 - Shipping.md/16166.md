#### PART 560-ACTIONS TO ADDRESS CONDITIONS UNDULY IMPAIRING ACCESS OF U.S.-FLAG VESSELS TO OCEAN TRADE BETWEEN FOREIGN PORTS
##### § 560.1 Purpose; general provisions.
###### ex parte

(2) The provisions of part 502 of this chapter (Rules of Practice and Procedure) shall not apply to this part except for those provisions governingcommunications (§ 502.11 of this chapter) and service of documents and copies of documents (§§ 502.114(b) and 502.118 of this chapter), and except as the Commission may otherwise determine by order.

(c) The condition of unduly impaired access will be found only where a U.S. flag carrier is commercially able to enter a trade in which its access is being unduly impaired, or is reasonably expected to be impaired, or where actual participation in a trade by a U.S. flag carrier is being restricted for reasons other than its commercial ability or competitiveness.

(d) In examining conditions in a trade between foreign ports, and in considering appropriate action, the Commission will give due regard to U.S. maritime policy and U.S. Government shipping arrangements with other nations, as well as the degree of reciprocal access afforded in U.S. foreign trades to the carriers of the countries against whom Commission action is contemplated.
