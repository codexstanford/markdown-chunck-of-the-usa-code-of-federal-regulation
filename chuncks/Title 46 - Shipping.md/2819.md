####### Relief valves.,modifies 101.2

(b)(). (1) Every system which may be exposed to pressures higher than the system's maximum allowable working pressure shall be safeguarded by appropriate relief devices. (See ยง 52.01-3 of this subchapter for definitions.) Relief valves are required at pump discharges except for centrifugal pumps so designed and applied that a pressure in excess of the maximum allowable working pressure for the system cannot be developed.

(2) The relief valve setting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the system. Its relieving capacity shall be sufficient to prevent the pressure from rising more than 20 percent above the system maximum allowable working pressure. The rated relieving capacity of safety and relief valves used in the protection of piping systems only shall be based on actual flow test data and the capacity shall be certified by the manufacturer at 120 percent of the set pressure of the valve.

(3) Relief valves shall be certified as required in part 50 of this subchapter for valves, and shall also meet the requirements of ยง 54.15-10 of this subchapter.
