###### Definition of a hazardous reaction-

As a first approximation, a mixture of two cargoes is considered hazardous when, under specified condition, the temperature rise of the mixture exceeds 25 &#xB0;C or a gas is evolved. It is possible for the reaction of two cargoes to produce a product that is significantly more flammable or toxic than the original cargoes even though the reaction is non-hazardous from temperature or pressure considerations, although no examples of such a reaction are known at this time.
