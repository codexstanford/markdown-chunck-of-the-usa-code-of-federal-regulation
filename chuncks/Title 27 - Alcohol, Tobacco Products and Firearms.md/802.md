####### Malt beverages bottled for another person.

(g)(1) If malt beverages are bottled for another person, the label may state, in addition to (but not in lieu of) the name and address of the bottler, the name and address of such other person, immediately preceded by the words "brewed and bottled for" or "bottled for" or another similar appropriate phrase. Such statements must clearly indicate the relationship between the two persons (for example, contract brewing).

(2) If the same brand of malt beverage is brewed and bottled by two or more breweries that are not under the same ownership, the label for each brewery may set forth all the locations where bottling takes place, as long as the label uses the actual location (and not the principal place of business) and as long as the nature of the arrangement is clearly set forth.
