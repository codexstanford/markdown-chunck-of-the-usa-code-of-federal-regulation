####### Boundary.

(c)The Ulupalakua viticultural area is located on the island of Maui, in Hawaii. The boundary of the Ulupalakua viticultural area is as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section:

(1) The beginning point is on the Makena, Hawaii, map at the intersection of an unnamed, light-duty road known locally as State Highway 37 and the northernmost unnamed, unimproved road in the Palauea land division (a land division is known as an "ahupua'a" in Hawaii). From the beginning point, proceed south along State Highway 37 to the next unnamed, unimproved road in the Palauea land division; then

(2) Proceed west in a straight line for approximately 2,700 feet to the 1,560-foot elevation contour; then

(3) Proceed north along the 1,560-foot elevation contour to the northern boundary of the Palauea land division; then

(4) Proceed east along the northern boundary of the Palauea land division to the 1,800-foot elevation contour; then

(5) Proceed south along the 1,800-foot elevation contour for approximately 400 feet to the point where the 1,800-foot elevation contour intersects with an imaginary line drawn from the terminus of the northernmost unnamed, unimproved road in the Palauea land division; then

(6) Proceed east in a straight line for approximately 800 feet, returning to the beginning point.
