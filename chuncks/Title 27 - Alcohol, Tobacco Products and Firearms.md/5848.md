(i) A person who produces tobacco products solely for that person's own consumption or use; or

(ii) A proprietor of a customs bonded manufacturing warehouse with respect to the operation of such warehouse.

(2) The term "Manufacturer of tobacco products" includes any person who for commercial purposes makes available for consumer use (including such consumer's personal consumption or use under paragraph (1)(i) of this definition) a machine capable of making cigarettes, cigars, or other tobacco products. A person making such a machine available for consumer use shall be deemed the person making the removal with respect to any tobacco products manufactured by such machine.
