####### Review,Appeal.

(e)-(1)A foreign producer may appeal an order of revocation issued under paragraph (d) of this section by submitting a written appeal to the appropriate TTB officer within 45 days of receipt of such order. The appeal must explain why the foreign producer believes its revocation is in error, supported by facts and analysis. The appeal must be submitted electronically through the means specified in the order of revocation. The appropriate TTB officer will issue a final decision by notifying the foreign producer within 90 days of receipt of the appeal whether the appeal is granted or denied, and the reasons for the determination. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once by an additional 90 days if the appropriate TTB officer requires additional time to consider the issues presented by an appeal and must notify the foreign producer of the extension within the initial 90-day period. If the appropriate TTB officer fails to issue a decision granting or denying the appeal within the applicable deadline, the appeal is denied and such denial will be considered a final decision.
