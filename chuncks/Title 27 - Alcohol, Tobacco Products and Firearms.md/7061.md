###### ยง 53.155 Extension of time for filing returns.
####### In general.

(a)Ordinarily, no extension of time will be granted for filing any return statement or other document required with respect to the taxes impose by chapter 32, because the information required for the filing of those documents is under normal circumstances readily available. However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control, a taxpayer believes an extension of time for filing is justified, the taxpayer may apply to the appropriate TTB officer for an extension. An extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in the extension. For extensions of time for payment of the tax, see ยง 53.156.
