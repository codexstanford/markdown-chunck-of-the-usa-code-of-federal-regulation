####### ยง 19.163 Area operations bond.
######## Area operations bonds filed by corporations.

(b)An area operations bond may only cover distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine cellars that are operated by the same person. For purposes of this section, a corporation and its controlled subsidiaries are considered to be one person. Further, a controlled subsidiary is a corporation in which more than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by the parent corporation. Consequently, an area operations bond may cover distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine cellars operated by a parent corporation and one or more of its controlled subsidiaries. The name of each corporation that operates a covered facility must appear on the bond as a principal, whether the operating corporation is the parent or a subsidiary. The bond must bear an authorized signature for each operating corporation appearing on the bond.
