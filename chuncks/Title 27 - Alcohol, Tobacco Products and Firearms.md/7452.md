######## Notice of sale.

(b)(1) As soon as practicable after seizure of the property, the appropriate TTB officer shall give notice of sale in writing to the owner. Such notice shall be delivered to the owner or left at the owner's usual place of abode or business if located. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business, the notice may be mailed to the owner's last known address. The notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof, and shall expressly state that only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to such property is to be offered for sale. The notice shall also be published in some newspaper published in the county wherein the seizure is made or in a newspaper generally circulated in that county. For example, if a newspaper of general circulation in a county but not published in that county will reach more potential bidders for the property to be sold than a newspaper published within the county, or if there is a newspaper of general circulation within the county but no newspaper published within the county, the appropriate TTB officer may cause public notice of the sale to be given in the newspaper of general circulation within the county. If there is no newspaper published or generally circulated in the county, the notice shall be posted at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places.

(2) The appropriate TTB officer may use other methods of giving notice of sale and of advertising seized property in addition to those referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, when the appropriate TTB officer believes that the nature of the property to be sold is such that a wider or more specialized advertising coverage will enhance the possibility of obtaining a higher price for the property.

(3) Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in 26 U.S.C. 6331(a) (relating to cases in which collection is in jeopardy), a public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless 26 U.S.C. 6336 (relating to perishable goods) is applicable.
