######## Furnishing and affixing securing devices.

(c)The proprietor must furnish and affix any seals, locks or other devices used on conveyances. However, TTB may require any conveyance in which spirits are transferred in bond, withdrawn free of tax, or withdrawn without payment of tax, to be secured by a device furnished by TTB and affixed by a TTB officer. The securing of a conveyance will be done:

(1) As soon as the conveyance is loaded for shipment; and

(2) In such a manner that access to the contents of the conveyance cannot be gained without leaving evidence of tampering.
