(c)The Texas Davis Mountains viticultural area is located in Jeff Davis County, Texas. The boundary is as follows:

(1) The beginning point is the intersection of Texas Highway 17 and Farm Road 1832 on the Fort Davis, Texas, U.S.G.S. map;

(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows Highway 17 in a southeasterly and then southwesterly direction until it reaches the intersection of Limpia Creek with the unnamed stream which flows through Grapevine Canyon on the Fort Davis, Texas, U.S.G.S. map;

(3) The boundary then proceeds in a straight line in a southwesterly direction until it meets Highway 118 at a gravel pit 1miles southeast of the intersection of Highway 118 and Highway 17;

(4) The boundary then proceeds in a straight line east by southeast until it meets Highway 166 at its junction with Highway 17;

(5) The boundary then follows Highway 166 in a southwesterly direction onto the Mt. Livermore, Texas-Chihuahua, U.S.G.S. map;

(6) The boundary then continues to follow Highway 166 in a westerly direction;

(7) The boundary then continues to follow Highway 166 as it turns in a northerly and then northeasterly direction to the point where it meets Highway 118;

(8) The boundary then follows Highway 118 in a northerly direction until it reaches a point where it intersects with the 1600 meter contour line, just north of Robbers Roost Canyon;

(9) The boundary then proceeds in a straight line due east for about two miles until it reaches the 1600 meter contour line to the west of Friend Mountain;

(10) The boundary then follows the 1600 meter contour line in a northeasterly direction until it reaches the northernmost point of Friend Mountain;

(11) The boundary then diverges from the contour line and proceeds in a straight line east-southeast until it reaches the beginning point of Buckley Canyon, approximately three fifths of a mile;

(12) The boundary then follows Buckley Canyon in an easterly direction to the point where it meets Cherry Canyon;

(13) The boundary then follows Cherry Canyon in a northeasterly direction to the point where it meets Grapevine Canyon on the Mt. Livermore, Texas-Chihuahua, U.S.G.S. map;

(14) The boundary then proceeds in a straight line from the intersection of Cherry and Grapevine Canyons to the peak of Bear Cave Mountain, on the Fort Davis, Texas, U.S.G.S. map;

(15) The boundary then proceeds in a straight line from the peak of Bear Cave Mountain to the point where Farm Road 1832 begins;

(16) The boundary then follows Farm Road 1832 back to its intersection with Texas Highway 17, at the point of beginning.
