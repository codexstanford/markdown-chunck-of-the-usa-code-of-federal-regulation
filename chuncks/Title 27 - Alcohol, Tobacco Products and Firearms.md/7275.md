######## In general.

(a)The interest rate established under 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) shall be:

(1) On amounts outstanding before July 1, 1975, 6 percent per annum.

(2) On amounts outstanding:

(3) On amounts outstanding after December 31, 1982, the adjusted rates for overpayment and underpayment established by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under 26 U.S.C. 6621. These adjusted rates shall be published by the Commissioner in a Revenue Ruling. See ยง 70.94 of this part for application of daily compounding in determining interest accruing after December 31, 1982. Because interest accruing after December 31, 1982, accrues at the prescribed rate per annum compounded daily, the effective annual percentage rate of interest will exceed the prescribed rate of interest.
