(b)If a check or money order tendered in payment of taxes is not paid on presentment, or if the taxpayer is otherwise in default in payment, then any remittance made during the period of default must be either in cash or by an acceptable certified instrument. The proprietor must continue to pay in cash or by certified instrument as long as the proprietor remains in default, and until the appropriate TTB officer finds that accepting a check will not jeopardize the revenue.
