Generally, a proprietor must bottle all spirits from tanks that are listed in the notice of registration and have been certified as accurate. However, if a proprietor files a letterhead application and shows the need to do so, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize bottling from original packages, tank trucks, totes or special containers where it is not practical to use a bottling tank. In addition, a proprietor may bottle liqueurs directly from a tank truck or tote without applying for permission to TTB if the liqueurs are gauged prior to unloading and piped directly to the bottling line.
