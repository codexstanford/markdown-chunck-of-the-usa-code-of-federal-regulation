####### e.g.,

(8) Fruit wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from one kind of fruit shall be designated by the word "wine" qualified by the name of such fruit,"peach wine," "blackberry wine," "orange wine." Fruit wine not derived wholly from one kind of fruit shall be designated as "fruit wine" or "berry wine," as the case may be, qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. If the fruit wine is derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from more than one citrus fruit, the designation "citrus wine" or "citrus fruit wine" may, but is not required to, be used instead of "fruit wine," and the designation must also be qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. Fruit wines which are derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples or pears may be designated "cider" and "perry," respectively, and shall be so designated if lacking in vinous taste, aroma, and characteristics. Fruit wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank, or bottle shall be further designated as "sparkling"; and fruit wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide otherwise derived shall be further designated as "carbonated."
