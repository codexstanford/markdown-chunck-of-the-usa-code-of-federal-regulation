(b)Where a person fails to deduct the credit or deducts less than the appropriate credit provided for by ยง 24.278 during the calendar year, the person may file a claim for refund of excess tax paid. The claim must be filed in accordance with ยง 24.69. In the case of wine removed on behalf of a small producer by a transferee in bond, if the transferee in bond was instructed to deduct credit and failed to deduct credit or deducted less than the appropriate credit and was later reimbursed for the tax by that producer, the transferee may file the claim. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6423 and 27 CFR part 70, subpart F, will apply, and the producer and transferee in bond must show that the conditions of ยง 24.278(b)(2) were met.
