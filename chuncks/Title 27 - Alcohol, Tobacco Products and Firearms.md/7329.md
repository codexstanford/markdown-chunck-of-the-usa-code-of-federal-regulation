(b) If more than the correct amount of tax, interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty is assessed but not paid to TTB, the person against whom the assessment is made may file a claim for abatement of such overassessment. Each claim for abatement under this section shall be made on Form 2635 (5020.8), Claim-Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Taxes, in accordance with the instructions on the form. All such claims must be filed with the appropriate TTB officer who made demand for the amount assessed.
