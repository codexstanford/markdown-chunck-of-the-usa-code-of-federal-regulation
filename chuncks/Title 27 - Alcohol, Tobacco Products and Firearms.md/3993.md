####### In bond.

When used with respect to wine or spirits, "in bond" refers to wine or spirits possessed under bond to secure the payment of the taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. Chapter 51, and on which such taxes have not been determined. Wine or spirits are considered to be possessed under bond if they are possessed by a proprietor who is liable for the tax, even if the proprietor is not required to provide a bond under this chapter. The term includes any wine or spirits on the bonded wine premises or a distilled spirits plant, or in transit between bonded premises (including in the case of wine, bonded wine premises). Additionally, the term refers to wine withdrawn without payment of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5362 and to spirits withdrawn without payment of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5214 (a)(5) or (a)(13) with respect to which relief from liability has not yet occurred.
