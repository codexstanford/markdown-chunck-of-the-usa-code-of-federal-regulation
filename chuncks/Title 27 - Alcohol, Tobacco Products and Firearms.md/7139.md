####### Exportation of tax-paid articles.

(b)A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code if the article is by any person exported to a foreign country or shipped to a possession of the United States. It is immaterial for purposes of this paragraph, whether the person who made the taxable sale had knowledge at the time of the sale that the article was being purchased for export to a foreign country or shipment to a possession of the United States. See ยง 53.184 for the circumstances under which a claim for refund by reason of the exportation of an article may be claimed by the exporter or shipper, rather than by the person who paid the tax. For definition of the term "possession of the United States", see ยง 53.11.
