######## Special rules relating to eligibility for wine credit,Controlled groups.

(b)-(1)For purposes of this section and ยง 24.279, the term "person" includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563(a), except that the phrase "more than 50 percent" must be substituted for the phrase "at least 80 percent" wherever it appears. Also, the rules for a "controlled group of corporations" apply in a similar fashion to groups that include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. Production and removals of all members of a controlled group are treated as if they were the production and removals of a single taxpayer for the purpose of determining what credit a person may use.
