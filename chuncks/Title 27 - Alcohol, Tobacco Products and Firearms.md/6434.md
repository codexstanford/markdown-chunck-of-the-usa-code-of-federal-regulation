###### ยง 44.32 Rate of special tax.
####### Reduced rate for small proprietors.

(b)Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any export warehouse proprietor whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by ยง 44.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The "taxable year" to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a "controlled group"; in that case, the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.
