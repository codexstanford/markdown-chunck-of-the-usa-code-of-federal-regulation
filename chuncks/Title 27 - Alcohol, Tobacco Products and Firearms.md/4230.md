###### ยง 24.182 Use of acid to correct natural deficiencies.
####### Grape wine.

(b)Tartaric acid or malic acid, or a combination of tartaric acid and malic acid, may be added prior to or during fermentation, to grapes or juice from grapes. In addition, after fermentation is completed, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid or tartaric acid, or a combination of two or more of these acids, may be added to correct natural deficiencies. However, the use of these acids, either prior to, during or after fermentation, may not increase the fixed acid level of the finished wine (calculated as tartaric acid) above 9.0 grams per liter. In cases where the wine contains 8.0 or more grams of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to the extent that the finished wine does not contain more than 11.0 grams per liter of fixed acid (calculated as tartaric acid).
