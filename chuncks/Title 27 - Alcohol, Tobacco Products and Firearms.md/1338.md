####### Boundary.

(c)The Virginia's Eastern Shore viticultural area is located in Accomack and Northampton counties, Virginia. The boundary is as follows:

(1) The beginning point is the intersection of the Virginia/Maryland border and Chincoteague Bay, near Greenbackville on the Salisbury, MD., U.S.G.S. map;

(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows the coastline in a southwesterly direction. Where there are marshes indicated on the U.S.G.S. maps, the boundry is the inland side of these marshes;

(3) When the boundary reaches the southernmost point of the peninsula, on the Eastville, VA., U.S.G.S. map, the boundary turns and proceeds in a northwesterly direction, again following the coastline around Cherrystone Inlet on the Richmond, VA., U.S.G.S. map;

(4) The boundary continues to follow the coastline and the inland side of any marshes indicated on the U.S.G.S. maps in a northeasterly direction, until it reaches the Virginia/Maryland border on the Eastville, VA., U.S.G.S. map;

(5) The boundary then follows the Virginia/Maryland border back to the beginning point at Chincoteague Bay on the Salisbury, MD., U.S.G.S. map.
