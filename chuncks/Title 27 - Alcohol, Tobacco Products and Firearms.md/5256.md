(b)Imported "natural wine," as defined in ยง 27.11, may, under the provisions of this subpart, be withdrawn in bulk by the proprietor of a bonded wine cellar from customs custody and transferred in bulk containers to the bonded wine cellar without payment of the internal revenue tax imposed on wine by 26 U.S.C. 5041. Imported wine so withdrawn and transferred may be withdrawn from a bonded wine cellar for any purpose authorized by 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, in the same manner as domestic wine. The proprietor of the bonded wine premises to which imported wine is transferred becomes liable for the tax on wine withdrawn from customs custody under 26 U.S. C. 5364. Upon release of the wine from customs custody, the importer is relieved of the liability for the tax.
