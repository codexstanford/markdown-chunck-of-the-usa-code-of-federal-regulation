######## Form of record.

(b)A serially numbered invoice or shipping document, signed or initialed by an agent or employee of the proprietor, will constitute the record of tax determination. Although neither the proof gallons nor the effective tax rate must be shown on the record of tax determination, each invoice or shipping document must contain information sufficient to enable TTB officers to determine the total proof gallons and, if applicable, each effective tax rate and the proof gallons removed at each effective tax rate. For purposes of this part, the total proof gallons calculated from each invoice or shipping document constitutes a single withdrawal.
