####### ยง 17.152 Time of use of spirits.
######## Products requiring additional processing or treatment.

(c)Further manipulation of a product, such as aging or filtering, subsequent to the mixing together of all of its ingredients, shall not postpone the time when spirits are considered used, as determined under paragraph (a) of this section. This is true even if at the time of use there has not yet been a final determination of alcoholic content by assay. If, however, it is later found necessary to add more distilled spirits to standardize the product, such added spirits shall be considered as used in the period during which they were added.
