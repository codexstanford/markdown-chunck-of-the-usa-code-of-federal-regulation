####### Distilled spirits bottled for another person.

(4)(i) If distilled spirits are bottled for another person, other than the actual distiller thereof, the label may state, in addition to (but not in place of) the name and address of the bottler, the name and address of such other person, immediately preceded by the words "bottled for" or another similar appropriate phrase. Such statements must clearly indicate the relationship between the two persons (for example, contract bottling).

(ii) If the same brand of distilled spirits is bottled by two distillers that are not under the same ownership, the label for each distiller may set forth both locations where bottling takes place, as long as the label uses the actual location (and not the principal place of business) and as long as the nature of the arrangement is clearly set forth.
