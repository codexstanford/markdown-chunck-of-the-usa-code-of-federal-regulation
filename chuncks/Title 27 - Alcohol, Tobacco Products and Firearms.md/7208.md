####### ยง 70.27 Right to intervene; right to institute a proceeding to quash.
######## Presumption no notice has been mailed.

(c)Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B) permits a notified person to institute a proceeding to quash by filing a petition in district court and notifying both the Bureau and the summoned person. Unless the notified person has notified both the Bureau and the summoned person in the appropriate manner, the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. If the copy of the petition has not been delivered to the summoned person or the person and office designated to receive the notice on behalf of the Bureau within 3 days from the close of the 20-day period allowed to institute a proceeding to quash, it is presumed that the notification has not been timely mailed.
