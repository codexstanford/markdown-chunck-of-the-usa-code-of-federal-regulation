(2)Such property or tract of property may be redeemed upon payment to the purchaser, or in case the purchaser cannot be found in the county in which the property to be redeemed is situated, then to the appropriate TTB officer, for the use of the purchaser, the purchaser's heirs, or assigns, the amount paid by such purchaser and interest thereon at the rate of 20 percent per annum. In case real and personal property (or several tracts of real property) are purchased in the aggregate, the redemption price of the real property (or of each of the several tracts) shall be determined on the basis of the ratio, as of the time of sale, of the value of the real property (or tract) to the value of the total property purchased. For this purpose the minimum price or the highest bid price, whichever is higher, offered for the property separately or in groups shall be treated as the value.
