######## Additional rules for annual and quarterly return periods.

(d)The following additional rules apply to the annual and quarterly return period procedures under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

(1) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the distilled spirits tax liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the return procedures;

(2) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the distilled spirits tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the return procedures;

(3) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the return procedures. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the return procedures, and that is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in distilled spirits excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT must be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);

(4) A new taxpayer is eligible to use the return procedures the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000, in the case of the annual return procedure, or $50,000, in the case of the quarterly return procedure, in distilled spirits taxes during that calendar year; and

(5) If a taxpayer becomes ineligible to use a return procedure described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section because the taxpayer's liability exceeds $1,000 or $50,000, respectively, during a taxable year, that taxpayer may resume using that return procedure only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $1,000 or $50,000 as the case may be. A taxpayer may not use an annual or quarterly return procedure during any calendar year in which the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for more than $1,000, in the case of the annual return procedure, or $50,000, in the case of the quarterly return procedure, in distilled spirits taxes.
