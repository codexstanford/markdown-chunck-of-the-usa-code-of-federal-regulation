###### ยง 53.183 Return of installment accounts causing overpayments of tax.
####### Overpayment of tax allocable to repaid consideration.

(b)The payment of tax imposed by section 4216(d)(1) of the Code on the sale of an installment account by the manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code to the extent of the tax allocable to any consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser of the installment account upon the return of the account to the manufacturer pursuant to the agreement under which the account originally was sold, if the readjustment of the consideration occurs pursuant to the provisions of the agreement. The tax allocable to the repaid or credited consideration is the amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax paid under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code with respect to the installment account as the amount of consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser bears to the total consideration for which the account was sold. This paragraph (b) does not apply where an installment account is originally sold pursuant to the order of, or subject to the approval of, a court of competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.
