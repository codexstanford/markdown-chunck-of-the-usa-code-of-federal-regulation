####### ยง 24.276 Prepayment of tax; proprietor in default.

When the proprietor fails to forward a payment for wine excise tax due by presentment of a check or money order, or when the proprietor is otherwise in default of payment of the tax, no wine may be removed for consumption or sale until the tax has been paid for the period of the default and until the appropriate TTB officer finds the revenue will not be jeopardized by the late payment of the tax. Any remittance made during the period of the default will be in cash, or will be in the form of a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any financial institution incorporated under the laws of the United States, or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or in the form of a money order, as provided in 27 CFR 70.61 (payment by check or money order) or in the form of an electronic fund transfer.
