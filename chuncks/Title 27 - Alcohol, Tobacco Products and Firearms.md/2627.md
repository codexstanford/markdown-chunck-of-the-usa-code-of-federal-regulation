(b)Whenever the proprietor manufactures a batch of the product with a lesser quantity or lower alcohol content of eligible wine or eligible flavor, this will result in a higher tax rate on the product since the product will have less alcohol qualifying for the credit under 26 U.S.C. 5010 and a higher percentage of alcohol taxable at the rate published in 26 U.S.C. 5001. In such instances, the proprietor must keep the cased goods segregated from other completed cases of the same product subject to the permanent standard effective tax rate for that product. The proprietor must determine the tax rate for the nonstandard batch in accordance with ยง 19.247.
