####### State of distillation for whisky.

(f)(1) The State of distillation, which is the State in which original distillation takes place, must appear on the label of any type of whisky defined in ยง 5.143(c)(2) through (7), which is distilled in the United States. The State of distillation may appear on any label and must be shown in at least one of the following ways:

(i) By including a "distilled by" (or "distilled and bottled by" or any other phrase including the word "distilled") statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location.

(ii) If the address shown in the "bottled by" statement includes the State in which distillation occurred, by including a "bottled by" statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location;

(iii) By including the name of the State in which original distillation occurred immediately adjacent to the class or type designation (such as "Kentucky bourbon whisky"), as long as the product was both distilled and aged in that State in conformance with the requirements of ยง 5.143(b); or

(iv) By including a separate statement, such as "Distilled in [name of State]."

(2) The appropriate TTB officer may require that the State of distillation or other information appear on a label of any whisky subject to the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section (and may prescribe placement requirements for such information), even if that State appears in the name and address statement, if such additional information is necessary to negate any misleading or deceptive impression that might otherwise be created as regards the actual State of distillation.

(3) In the case of "light whisky," the State name "Kentucky" or "Tennessee" may not appear on any label, except as a part of a name and address as specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section.
