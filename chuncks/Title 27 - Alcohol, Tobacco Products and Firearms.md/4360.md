######## General.

(a)This section governs payment of tax on a deferred basis. The tax on wine is paid by an Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, which is filled with a remittance (check, cash, or money order) of the full amount of tax due. Prepayments of tax on wine during the period covered by the return are shown separately on the Excise Tax Return form. If no tax is due for the return period, the filing of a return is not required.
