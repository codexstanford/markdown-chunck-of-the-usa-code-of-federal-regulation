######## Production of spirits.

(a)The following rules apply to the maintenance of production records:

(1) A proprietor must maintain daily production account records of the kind and quantity of distilled spirits produced. The records must show the gauge of spirits in each receiving tank and the production gauge (in proof gallons) of spirits removed from each tank. If packages are filled according to the production gauge for immediate withdrawal from bond, the proprietor must record the details of the individual packages filled;

(2) A proprietor must maintain daily records of spirits lost or destroyed prior to the production gauge; and

(3) A proprietor must maintain production account records in a manner that will ensure the tracing of spirits through the distilling system to the mash or other material from which the spirits were produced and that will clearly establish the identity of the spirits.
