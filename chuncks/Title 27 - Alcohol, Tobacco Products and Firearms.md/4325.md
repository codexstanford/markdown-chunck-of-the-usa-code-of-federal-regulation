####### Wine and juice.

(a)Materials used in the process of filtering, clarifying, or purifying wine may remove cloudiness, precipitation, and undesirable odors and flavors, but the addition of any substance foreign to wine that changes the character of the wine, or the abstraction of ingredients so as to change the character of the wine, if not consistent with good commercial practice, is not permitted on bonded wine premises. The materials listed in this section are approved as being consistent with good commercial practice in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine and, where applicable, in the treatment of juice, within the "Specific TTB limitation" of this section and subject to the following conditions:

(1) If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informs TTB that a specified use or limitation of any material listed in this section is inconsistent with the food additive requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the appropriate TTB officer may cancel or amend the approval for use of the material in the treatment of wine and juice in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine; and

(2) Where water is added to facilitate the solution or dispersal of a material, the volume of water added, whether the material is used singly or in combination with other water-based treating materials, may not total more than 1 percent of the volume of the treated wine or juice, or of both the wine and the juice, from which the wine is produced.
