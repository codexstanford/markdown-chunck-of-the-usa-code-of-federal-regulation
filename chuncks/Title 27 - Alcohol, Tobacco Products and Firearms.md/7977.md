####### ยง 71.65 Answer admitting facts.

If the respondent desires to waive the hearing on the allegations of fact set forth in the order to show cause, and does not contest the facts, the answer may consist of a statement that the respondent admits all material allegations of fact charged in the citation to be true. The appropriate TTB officer shall thereupon base the decision on the citation and such answer although such an answer shall not affect the respondent's right to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or the right to appeal.
