######## Bond guaranteed by deposit of securities,General.

(a)-(1)As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under ยง 19.153, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by pledging one or more acceptable negotiable securities. These securities must have a par value (face amount) equal to or greater than the penal sums of the required bonds. The pledged securities are held in the Federal Reserve Bank in a safekeeping account with TTB as the pledgee. Should the proprietor fail to pay one or more of the guaranteed liabilities, TTB can take action to sell the deposited securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be released if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated. (See ยง 19.170.)
