(c)The inventory reserve account for each product must be depleted in the same order in which the deposit records were entered into the account. The proprietor must record a depletion for each disposition (for example, a taxable removal, an exportation, or an inventory shortage or breakage) by entering on the deposit record:

(1) The transaction date;

(2) The transaction record serial number;

(3) The proof gallons disposed of; and

(4) The proof gallons remaining. If any depletion exceeds the quantity of product remaining on the deposit record, the proprietor must deplete the remaining quantity, close the deposit record, and then deplete the remainder of the transaction from the next deposit record.
