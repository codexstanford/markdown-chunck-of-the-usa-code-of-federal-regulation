####### Bond exemption.

(e)A brewer who pays tax on a deferred basis under § 25.164 is not required to provide a bond to cover operations and withdrawals of beer during any portion of a calendar year for which the brewer is eligible to use an annual or quarterly return period under § 25.164(c)(2) or (c)(3). A brewer is considered to be paying tax on a deferred basis for purposes of the preceding sentence even if the brewer does not pay tax during every return period as long as the brewer intends to pay tax in a future period. See §§ 25.62 and 25.79 for rules governing applying for this bond exemption. See § 25.95 for rules governing when an existing brewer who has not provided a bond under this paragraph must obtain bond coverage.
