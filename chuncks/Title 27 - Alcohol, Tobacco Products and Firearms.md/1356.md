####### Boundary.

(c)The Escondido Valley viticultural area is located in Pecos County, Texas. The boundary is as follows:

(1) The beginning point is the intersection of Interstate Route 10 (I-10) and an intermittent stream approximately 18 miles east of the city of Fort Stockton (standard reference GE3317 on the Fort Stockton, Texas, U.S.G.S. map);

(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows I-10 in an easterly direction approximately 9 miles until a southbound trail diverges from I-10 just past the point where it intersects horizontal grid line 2 of square GE on the Fort Stockton, Texas, U.S.G.S. map;

(3) The boundary then follows the trail in a generally southeasterly direction about 5 miles until it intersects the 3000 foot contour line;

(4) The boundary follows the 3000 foot contour line in a generally westerly direction approximately 17 miles;

(5) The boundary continues to follow the 3000 foot contour line as it turns sharply northwest, but diverges from the contour line when the contour line turns south again;

(6) From the point where it diverges from the contour line, the boundary follows a straight north-northwesterly line as it returns to the beginning point at I-10.
