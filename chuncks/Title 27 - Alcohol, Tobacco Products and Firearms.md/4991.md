(a)Where the brewer will defer payment of tax, he must execute the agreement on TTB Form 5100.21 to pay the amount of tax which has been computed and entered on the form. If a bond is required under ยง 26.68, he must certify under the penalties of perjury that he is not in default of any payment of tax chargeable against his bond, and that his bond is in the maximum penal sum, or that it is sufficient to cover the amount of tax on the beer described on the form in addition to all other amounts chargeable against his bond. If the brewer deferring payment of tax is not required to provide a bond under ยง 26.68, the brewer must certify under the penalties of perjury that the brewer was liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes in the preceding calendar year and reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 during the current calendar year. The brewer must deliver all copies of Form 5100.21 to the revenue agent.
