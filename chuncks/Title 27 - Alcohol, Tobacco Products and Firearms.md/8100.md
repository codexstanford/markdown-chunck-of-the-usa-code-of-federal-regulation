###### ยง 73.40 May I satisfy TTB requirements to submit forms to other agencies by submitting those forms electronically?

You may satisfy any requirement in the TTB regulations to submit a form (as that term is defined in ยง 73.3) to another agency by submitting such form to such agency by electronic means, as long as the agency provides for, and authorizes, the electronic submission of such form and you satisfy any registration or related requirement by that agency for that electronic submission. The submission of a form electronically to another agency does not alter any requirement regarding copies you must maintain.
