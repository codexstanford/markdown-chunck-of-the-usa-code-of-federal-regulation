####### Repossession of an article.

(c)If a taxable article is repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. However, if the manufacturer later resells the repossessed article for a price in excess of the original adjusted sale price, the manufacturer will be liable for tax under chapter 32 of the Code to the extent that the resale price exceeds the original adjusted sale price.
