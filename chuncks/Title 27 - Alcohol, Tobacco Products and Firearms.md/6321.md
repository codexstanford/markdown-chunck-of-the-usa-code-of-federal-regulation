###### ยง 41.181 Records of large cigars.
####### Alternative record.

(d)If an importer has so few import transactions and/or brands and sizes of large cigars that retention of an appropriate copy of each entry and withdrawal form required under paragraph (c) of this section will provide an adequate record of sale prices, then the record required under paragraph (a) of this section need not be kept. In such case the entry and withdrawal forms must identify the brands and sizes of cigars covered and show the corresponding quantity and sale price for each. If such information was not originally entered on the form it may be included by annotation. Whenever the appropriate TTB officer finds that alternative records being kept pursuant to this paragraph are inadequate for the intended purpose, he or she may so notify the importer in writing, after which time the importer must keep the record required under paragraph (a) of this section.
