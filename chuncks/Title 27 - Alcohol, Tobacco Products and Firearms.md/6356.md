######## Application for permit.

(a)Any person who intends to engage in the business of importing processed tobacco, and who is not engaged in the business of importing tobacco products, must apply for a permit by completing and submitting TTB F 5230.4 in accordance with the instructions on that form. All documents required under this subpart to be furnished with the application must be included with the application when it is submitted. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the application is incomplete and, for that reason, does not include sufficient information for TTB to make a decision on the application, and if the applicant has not provided the missing information within one year of a written request for it or within any shorter time period specified in the written request, the application will be deemed abandoned and the applicant will be notified in writing that no permit will be issued in response to the incomplete application. In the case of an application filed in accordance with ยง 41.233, such notification will constitute the final action on the application and such party will no longer be able to continue as an importer of processed tobacco.
