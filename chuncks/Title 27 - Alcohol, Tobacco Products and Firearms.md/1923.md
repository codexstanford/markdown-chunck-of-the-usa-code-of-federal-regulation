####### Time limits for decision after second appeal.

(b)Within 90 days of receipt of the second appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify the appellant whether the appeal has been granted or denied. If an applicant requests an informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in ยง 13.71, the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once, by an additional 90 days, if he or she finds that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the unique issues presented by an appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends the time period, he or she must notify the applicant by letter, briefly explaining the issues presented by the label. The decision made on the second appeal shall be the final decision of TTB.
