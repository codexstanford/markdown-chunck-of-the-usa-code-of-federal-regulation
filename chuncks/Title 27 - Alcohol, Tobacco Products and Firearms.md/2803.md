(c)As a general rule, a consignor must prepare a transfer record for each conveyance. However, a consignor may prepare a single transfer record that covers all packages of spirits shipped by truck on the same day to the same plant. In such a case, the consignor must prepare a shipment and delivery order for each shipment showing the number of packages, their serial numbers or other package identification, the name of the producer, warehouseman, or processor, and the serial numbers of any seals or other security devices applied to the truck. The shipping and delivery order must be properly authenticated by the consignor and must constitute a complete record of the spirits transferred in each truck each day. The consignor must retain a copy of each shipping and delivery order. After lading the last truck for the day, the consignor must retain one copy of the single transfer record and one copy of any accompanying document and forward the original single transfer record and accompanying document to the consignee.
