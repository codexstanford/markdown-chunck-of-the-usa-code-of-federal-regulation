(c)A proprietor may also guarantee payment under a bond without using a corporate surety, by filing a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by pledging and depositing one or more acceptable negotiable securities having a par value (face amount) equal to or greater than the penal sums of the required bonds. Should the proprietor fail to pay one or more of the guaranteed liabilities, TTB may take action to sell the deposited securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be released to the proprietor if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated; the provisions of ยง 19.173 apply to the release of pledged securities under this subpart. A list of securities acceptable as collateral in lieu of surety bonds is available from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Current information and guidance from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Web site may be found at.
