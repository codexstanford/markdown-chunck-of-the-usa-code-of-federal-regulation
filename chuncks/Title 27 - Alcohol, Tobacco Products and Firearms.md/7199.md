####### ยง 70.26 Third-party recordkeepers.
######## When third-party recordkeeper status arises.

(b)A person is a "third-party recordkeeper" with respect to a given set of records only if the person made or kept the records in the person's capacity as a third-party recordkeeper. Thus, for instance, an accountant is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being an accountant) with respect to the accountant's records of a sale of property by the accountant to another person. Similarly, a credit card issuer is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being a person extending credit through the use of credit cards or similar devices) with respect to:

(1) Records relating to noncredit card transactions, such as a cash sale by the issuer to a holder of the issuer's credit card; or

(2) Records relating to transactions involving the use of another issuer's credit card.
