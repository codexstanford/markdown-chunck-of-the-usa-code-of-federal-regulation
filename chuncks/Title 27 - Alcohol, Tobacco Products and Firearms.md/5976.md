###### Records
####### ยง 40.184 Record of removals subject to tax.
######## Exceptions.

(b)(1) The record of removal may consist of the manufacturer's commercial documents, such as copies of invoices, rather than records prepared expressly to meet the requirements of this section. If commercial documents are used, they must be kept at the factory, contain all the details required by this section, and be clear and accurate. Commercial documents that do not show specifically the tax classification of tobacco products (including sale price of large cigars) are still acceptable if they contain adequate information for an appropriate TTB officer to readily ascertain the applicable tax.

(2) Where tobacco products are delivered within the factory directly to the consumer, the record need not show the name and address of the consumer.
