####### Other age representations.

(f)(1) If a representation that is similar to an age or maturity statement permitted under this section appears on a label, a statement of age, in a manner that is conspicuous and in characters at least half the type size of the representation must also appear on each label that carries the representation, except in the following cases:

(i) The use of the word "old" or another word denoting age as part of the brand name of the product is not deemed to be an age representation that requires a statement of age; and

(ii) Labels of whiskies and brandies (other than immature brandies, pomace brandy, marc brandy, Pisco brandy, Singani brandy, and grappa brandy) not required to bear a statement of age, and rum and agave spirits aged for not less than four years, may contain general inconspicuous age, maturity or similar representations without the label having to bear an age statement.

(2) Distillation dates (which may be an exact date or a year) may appear on a label of spirits where the spirits are manufactured solely through distillation. A distillation date may only appear if an optional or mandatory age statement is used on the label and must appear in the same field of vision as the age statement.
