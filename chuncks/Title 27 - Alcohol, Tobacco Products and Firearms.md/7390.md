######## Treatment of reinstated lien.

(B)As of the effective date of reinstatement, a reinstated lien has the same force and effect as a general tax lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 which arises upon assessment of a tax liability. The reinstated lien continues in existence until the liability is satisfied or until the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the tax liability to which it relates. The reinstatement of the lien does not retroactively reinstate a previously filed notice of lien. The reinstated lien is not valid against any holder of a lien or interest described in ยง 70.145 of this part until notice of the reinstated lien has been filed in accordance with the provisions of ยง 70.148 of this part subsequent to or concurrent with the time the reinstated lien became effective.
