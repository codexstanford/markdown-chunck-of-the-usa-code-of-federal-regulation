###### ยง 53.156 Extension of time for paying tax shown on return.
####### In general.

(a)(1) Ordinarily, no extensions of time will be granted for payment of any tax imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code, and shown or required to be shown on any return. However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control a taxpayer believes an extension of time for payment is justified, the taxpayer may apply for an extension filing TTB Form 5600.38. The period of an extension shall not be in excess of 6 months from the date fixed for payment of the tax, except that if the taxpayer is abroad the period of the extension may be in excess of 6 months.

(2) The granting of an extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for the payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in the extension. See ยง 53.155.
