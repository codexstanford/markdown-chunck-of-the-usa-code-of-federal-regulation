####### General.

(a)Wine, or wine products made from wine, may be treated with methods or materials which render the wine or wine products unfit for beverage use. No wine or wine products so treated may contain more than 21 percent of alcohol by volume at the time of withdrawal free of tax from bonded wine premises; nor may any wine or wine product so withdrawn be used in the compounding of distilled spirits or wine for beverage use or in the manufacture of any product intended to be used in the compounding. Wine or wine products produced under this section will be clearly identified and segregated from beverage wine products while stored on bonded wine premises and may be transferred in bond between bonded wine premises. The shipping records for transfers in bond of nonbeverage wine or wine products will be marked "Not for Sale or Consumption as Beverage Wine." Upon removal from bonded wine premises free of tax, containers of nonbeverage wine or wine products will be marked to clearly indicate such products are not for sale or consumption as beverage wine, e.g., salted wine, vinegar, nonbeverage cooking wine.
