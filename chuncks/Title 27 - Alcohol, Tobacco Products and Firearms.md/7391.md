###### Lien for Taxes
####### ยง 70.150 Release of lien or discharge of property.
######## Certificates void under certain conditions.

(3)Notwithstanding any other provisions of 26 U.S.C. subtitle F, any lien for Federal taxes attaches to any property with respect to which a certificate of discharge has been issued if the person liable for the tax reacquires the property after the certificate has been issued. Thus, if property subject to a Federal tax lien is discharged therefrom and is later reacquired by the delinquent taxpayer at a time when the lien is still in existence, the tax lien attaches to the reacquired property and is enforceable against it as in the case of after-acquired property generally.
