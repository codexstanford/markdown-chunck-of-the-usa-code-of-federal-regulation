Where the amount of any bond is no longer sufficient under the provisions of ยง 40.133 or ยง 40.134, the manufacturer shall immediately file a strengthening bond in an appropriate amount with the same surety as that on the bond already in effect, unless a superseding bond is filed pursuant to ยง 40.136.
