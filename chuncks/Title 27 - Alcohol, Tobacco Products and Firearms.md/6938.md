###### ยง 53.95 Constructive sale price; basic rules.
####### Sales on consignment.

(c)As in the case of sales at retail, the constructive sale price for sales on consignment shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course for trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph, an article is considered to be sold on consignment if it is sold while it is on consignment to a person which has the right to sell, and does sell, such article in its own name, but never receives title to the article from the manufacturer. Ordinarily, the constructive sale price of an article sold on consignment is the net price received by the manufacturer from the consignee. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph shall not apply if the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and ยง 53.96 apply.
