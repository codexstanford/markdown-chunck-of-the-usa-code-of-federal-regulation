######## General requirements for production gauges.

(a)A proprietor must gauge all spirits by determining the quantity and proof as soon as reasonably possible after production is completed. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a proprietor may determine the quantity by volume or by weight, by an accurate mass flow meter, or when approved by the appropriate TTB officer, by other devices or methods that accurately determine the quantities. If caramel is added to brandy or rum, the proof of the spirits must be determined after the addition. Spirits in each receiving tank will be gauged before any reduction in proof and both before and after each removal of spirits. The gauges must be recorded in the records required by ยง 19.585.
