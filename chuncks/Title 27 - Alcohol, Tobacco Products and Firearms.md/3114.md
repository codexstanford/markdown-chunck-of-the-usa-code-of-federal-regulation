(c)For the changes specified in §§ 19.685(c), 19.686, and 19.690 of this subpart, the proprietor may submit a letterhead application to the appropriate TTB officer for a change instead of filing an amended TTB F 5110.74. A letterhead application must be on letterhead signed by an authorized representative of the permit holder. The letterhead application must identify the alcohol fuel plant to which the application applies. The letterhead application change is subject to TTB approval. The appropriate TTB officer may, at any time, require that the proprietor submit an amended application on TTB F 5110.74 if administrative difficulties occur as a result of the letterhead application.
