######## Industrial use.

(2)A proprietor is required to provide one or more bonds to cover operations and withdrawals of distilled spirits for industrial use even if the proprietor pays tax on a deferred basis under ยง 19.235 and is eligible to use an annual or quarterly return period under ยง 19.235(b) or (c). In the case of a proprietor whose operations involve distilled spirits for both nonindustrial and industrial use, distilled spirits are considered to be for industrial use for purposes of this paragraph unless the proprietor designates the spirits as being solely for nonindustrial use either upon taking the production gauge (see ยง 19.304) or upon receiving the spirits and, in either case, does not thereafter mix the spirits with any spirits for industrial use.
