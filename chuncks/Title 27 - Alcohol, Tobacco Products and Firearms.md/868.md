####### Rules for designation.

(b)(1) A designation in accordance with trade understanding must identify the base product, such as "malt beverage," "beer," "ale," "porter," "stout," "lager," or "malt liquor" along with a modifier or explanation that provides the consumer with adequate information about the fruit, honey, or other food ingredient used in production of the malt beverage. The label may include additional information about the production process (such as "beer fermented with cherry juice").

(2) Where more than one exempted ingredient is included, a designation in accordance with trade understanding may identify each ingredient (such as "Ale with cherry juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg"), refer to the ingredients by category (such as "Fruit ale," "Spiced ale," or "Ale with natural flavors"), or simply include the ingredient or ingredients that the bottler or importer believes best identify the product (such as "Cherry ale," "Cinnamon ale," or "Nutmeg ale"). The designation must distinguish the product from a malt beverage, beer, ale, porter, stout, lager, or malt liquor that is not brewed or flavored with any of these ingredients; thus, unmodified designations such as "beer," "stout," or "ale" would not be acceptable.
