######## 1,Additional labeling rules effective for wines eligible for the "hard cider" tax class.

()For wines removed from wine premises on or after January 1, 2017, that are taxed at the "hard cider" tax rate, the designation must be consistent with a hard cider tax class. For example, the designations "hard cider," "hard perry," "apple wine," "pear wine," "apple cider," "apple perry," "apple pear wine," "cider" and "perry" are consistent with the hard cider tax class. The designation "blueberry cider" is not consistent with the hard cider tax class, because it indicates that the product contains either blueberries or blueberry flavors, which are not authorized for use in wine that is eligible for the hard cider tax class. If the hard cider contains more than 0.392 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters, the word "sparkling" or "carbonated," as applicable, must be on the label.
