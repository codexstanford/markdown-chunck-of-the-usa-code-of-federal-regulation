###### ยง 27.183 Use of Government agency permit, Form 5150.33.

Each Government agency must retain the original of its permit, Form 5150.33, on file. In the case of an agency holding a single permit for use of its sub-agencies, an attachment to the permit must list all locations authorized to withdraw spirits free of tax from customs custody. When withdrawing spirits free of tax from a port of entry, the agency, if filing electronically, must file its TTB-issued permit number along with the filing of any other information required by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to be filed with the customs entry. If the agency is not filing electronically, rather than file the TTB-issued permit number, the agency must make a copy of the permit available to the customs officer upon request.
