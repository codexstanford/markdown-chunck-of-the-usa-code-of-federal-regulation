####### Crackling wine, petillant wine, frizzante wine

(4)(including cremant, perlant, reciotto, and other similar wine) is sparkling light wine normally less effervescent than champagne or other similar sparkling wine, but containing sufficient carbon dioxide in solution to produce, upon pouring under normal conditions, after the disappearance of air bubbles, a slow and steady effervescence evidenced by the formation of gas bubbles flowing through the wine. Crackling wine which derives its effervescence from secondary fermentation in containers greater than 1-gallon capacity shall be designated "crackling wine-bulk process," and the words "bulk process" shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size as the words "crackling wine."
