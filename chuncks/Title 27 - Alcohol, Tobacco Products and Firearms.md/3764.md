(c)None when tested by the following method: Add 20 mL of absolute alcohol or glacial acetic acid (m. p. 13&#xB0; to 15 &#xB0;C.) to 2 grams of the shellac and thoroughly dissolve. Add 100 mL of petroleum ether and mix thoroughly. Add approximately 2 liters of water and separate a portion of the ether layer (at least 50 mL) and filter if cloudy. Evaporate the petroleum ether and test as follows: Solution A-5 mL of phenol dissolved in 10 mL of carbon tetrachloride. Solution B-1 mL of bromine dissolved in 4 mL of carbon tetrachloride. To the residue obtained above add 2 mL of Solution A and transfer the mixture to a porcelain spot plate, filling one cavity. Immediately fill an adjacent cavity with solution B. Cover the plate with a watch glass and observe any color formation in Solution A. A decided purple or deep indigo blue color is an indication of the presence of rosin.
