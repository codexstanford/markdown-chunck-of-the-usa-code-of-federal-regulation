####### Supporting evidence.

(3)Any manufacturer, producer, or importer claiming an exemption from the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code by reason of section 4182(b) and section 655, title 14 of the Code must maintain such records and be prepared to produce such evidence as will establish the right to the exemption. Generally, clearly identified orders or contracts of a military department signed by an authorized officer of the military department will be sufficient to establish the right to the exemption. In the absence of such orders or contracts, a statement, signed by an authorized officer of a military department or the Coast Guard, that the prescribed articles were purchased with funds appropriated for that military department or the Coast Guard will constitute satisfactory evidence of the right to an exemption.
