######## Records of receipt.

(a)All retail dealers must keep at their place of business complete records showing the quantities of all distilled spirits, wines, and beer received, from whom the distilled spirits, wines, and beer were received, and the dates of receipt. However, the appropriate TTB officer may, upon request, authorize the maintenance of records at another business premises also under the control of the same retail dealer when it is determined that such maintenance will not cause undue inconvenience to TTB officers desiring to examine those records. Records of receipts shall consist of all purchase invoices or bills covering distilled spirits, wines, and beer received, or, at the option of the retail dealer, a book record containing all of the required information.
