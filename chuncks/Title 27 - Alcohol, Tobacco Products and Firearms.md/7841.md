######## In general.

(a)The appropriate TTB officer may enter into a written agreement with any person relating to the liability of such person (or of the person or estate for whom the person acts) in respect of any tax imposed under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau for any taxable period ending prior or subsequent to the date of such agreement. A closing agreement may be entered into in any case in which there appears to be an advantage in having the case permanently and conclusively closed, or if good and sufficient reasons are shown by the taxpayer for desiring a closing agreement and it is determined by the appropriate TTB officer that the United States will sustain no disadvantage through consummation of such an agreement.
