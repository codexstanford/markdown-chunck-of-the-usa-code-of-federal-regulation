####### § 19.169 Effect of failure to furnish a superseding bond or a new bond.
######## Withdrawal bond.

(b)Except as provided in § 19.151(d), a person may not defer payment of taxes on spirits withdrawn from a distilled spirits plant upon determination of tax without a withdrawal bond. If a person is required to submit a new or superseding withdrawal bond under § 19.168, the person must submit the bond in accordance with that section. A person who does not submit and receive approval of an acceptable withdrawal bond when required to do so under § 19.168 may not withdraw distilled spirits from the bonded premises on a deferred basis. Upon lapse of the existing bond coverage, or upon the date a new bond is required under § 19.168(b), the person must pay the tax at the time of withdrawal, except in the case of distilled spirits withdrawn free of tax or withdrawn without payment of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5214 or withdrawn exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 7510.
