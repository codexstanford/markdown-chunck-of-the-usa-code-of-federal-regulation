####### Champagne

(2)is a type of sparkling light wine which derives its effervescence solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within glass containers of not greater than one gallon capacity, and which possesses the taste, aroma, and other characteristics attributed to champagne as made in the champagne district of France.

(3)(i) A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise conforming to the standard for "champagne" may, in addition to but not in lieu of the class designation "sparkling wine," be further designated as:

(A) "Champagne style;" or

(B) "Champagne type;" or

(C) "American (or New York State, Napa Valley, etc.) champagne," along with one of the following terms: "Bulk process," "fermented outside the bottle," "secondary fermentation outside the bottle," "secondary fermentation before bottling," "not fermented in the bottle," or "not bottle fermented." The term "charmat method" or "charmat process" may be used as additional information.

(ii) Labels shall be so designed that all the words in such further designation are readily legible under ordinary conditions and are on a contrasting background. In the case of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, TTB will consider whether the label as a whole provides the consumer with adequate information about the method of production and origin of the wine. TTB will evaluate each label for legibility and clarity, based on such factors as type size and style for all components of the further designation and the optional term "charmat method" or "charmat process," as well as the contrast between the lettering and its background, and the placement of information on the label.

(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B) and (C) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the use of a term on sparkling wine labels, as an alternative to those terms authorized in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, but not in lieu of the required class designation "sparkling wine," upon a finding that such term adequately informs the consumer about the method of production of the sparkling wine.
