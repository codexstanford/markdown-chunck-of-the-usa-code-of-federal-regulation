(i)The property may be sold at any time after it has been acquired by the United States.

The notice shall specify the property to be sold and the time, place, manner, and conditions of sale. In addition, the appropriate TTB officer may use such other methods of advertising as such officer believes will result in obtaining the highest price for the property. Generally, the place of sale will be within the area where the property was originally acquired by the United States. However, if the appropriate TTB officer believes that a substantially higher price may be obtained, the sale may be held outside such area.
