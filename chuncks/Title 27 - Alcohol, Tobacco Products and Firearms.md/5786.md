######## Requirement.

(a)Every wholesale dealer in liquors must, when required, submit monthly to the appropriate TTB officer a summary report of the total quantities of all distilled spirits received and disposed of daily during the month (including the date of discovery for theft, casualty and inventory losses and inventory gains). This report must be posted by the wholesaler on a daily basis. If there were no receipts or disposals of distilled spirits during the month, the report must be marked "No Transactions During Month." This report must be filed not later than the 15th day of the month following the report period, with a copy retained by the dealer. The appropriate TTB officer may authorize a dealer, upon request, to post the report less frequently until otherwise notified; the appropriate TTB officer's authorization will specify the intervals at which the posting will be accomplished, but not less frequently than monthly.
