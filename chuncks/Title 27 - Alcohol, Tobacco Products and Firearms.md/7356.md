####### ยง 70.147 Priority of interest and expenses.
######## Satisfaction of liens.

(d)The amounts described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section include expenditures incurred by the protected holder of a lien or security interest to discharge a statutory lien for State sales taxes on the property subject to the lien or security interest if both the lien or security interest and the sales tax lien have priority over a Federal tax lien. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security interest is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the lien or security interest even though under local law the holder of the lien or security interest is not subrogated to the rights of the holder of the State sales tax lien. However, if the holder of the lien or security interest is subrogated, within the meaning of ยง 70.144(b) of this part, to the rights of the holder of the sales tax lien, the holder of the lien or security interest will also be entitled to any additional protection afforded by 26 U.S.C. 6323(i)(2)
