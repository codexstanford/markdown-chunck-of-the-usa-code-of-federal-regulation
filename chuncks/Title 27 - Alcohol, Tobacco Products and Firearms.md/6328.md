(a)All records, reports, and other documents required under this part must be maintained separately, chronologically by transaction or reporting date, at the importer's principal place of business. The appropriate TTB officer may, pursuant to an application by the importer for an approved alternate method or procedure under ยง 41.26, authorize such documents to be maintained at another business location under the control of the importer, if the conditions of ยง 41.26 are met and provided that the use of the alternate location does not cause undue inconvenience to TTB when attempting to examine the files and does not delay the timely transmittal of any document required to be submitted to TTB.
