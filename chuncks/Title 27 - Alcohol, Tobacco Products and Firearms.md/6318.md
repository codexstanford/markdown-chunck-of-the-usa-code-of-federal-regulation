####### Basic record.

(a)The importer must keep a record to show each sale price (as determined under ยง 41.39), which is applicable to large cigars removed. No later than the tenth business day in January of each year the importer must prepare such a record to show the sale price in effect on the first day of that year for each brand and size of large cigars. The importer must note any change in a price from that shown in the record within ten business days after such change in price. The record must be a continuing one for each brand and size of cigar (and type of packaging, if pertinent), so that the taxable price on any date may be readily ascertained. If an importer removes new types of large cigars after the beginning of the year, the importer must enter the sale price and its effective date for such large cigars in the basic record within ten business days after such removal.
