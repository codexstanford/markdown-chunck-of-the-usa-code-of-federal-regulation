######## Bottle or other container fill.

(b)Proprietors of bonded wine premises and taxpaid wine bottling house premises shall fill bottles or other containers as nearly as possible to conform to the amount shown on the label or blown in the bottle or marked on any container other than a bottle; but in no event may the amount of wine contained in any individual bottle, due to lack of uniformity of the bottles, vary from the amount stated more than 1.0 percent for 15.0 liters and above, 1.5 percent for 1.0 liter to 14.9 liters, 2.0 percent for 750 mL, 3.0 percent for 375 mL, 4.5 percent for 187 mL and 100 mL, and 9.0 percent for 50 mL; and in such case, there will be substantially as many bottles overfilled as there are bottles underfilled for each lot of wine bottled. Short-filled bottles or other containers of wine which are sold or otherwise disposed of by the proprietor to employees for personal consumption need not be labeled, but, if labeled, need not show an accurate statement of net contents.
