####### ยง 46.205 Guidelines to determine title to articles in transit.

The dealer may use the following guidelines to establish who holds title to articles in transit.

(a) If State law mandates the change in title, then no agreement or contract between seller and buyer can alter it.

(b) In the absence of State law governing the change of title between seller and buyer, the Uniform Commercial Code allows the seller and buyer to agree when title passes.

(c) If there is no State law or agreement between the seller and buyer, the Uniform Commercial Code states that title transfer depends on how the seller ships the articles.

(1) If the shipment is free on board (F.O.B.) destination, the title transfer occurs when the seller completes the physical delivery of the articles.

(2) If the shipment is free on board (F.O.B.) shipping point, the title transfer occurs at the time and place of shipment, which is generally by common carrier.
