######## Taking of action as provided in 26 U.S.C. 7609(b).

(3)Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) allows intervention by a notified person as a matter of right upon compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The phrase "takes any action as provided in subsection (b)", found in 26 U.S.C. 7609(e), includes any intervention whether or not 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) is specifically mentioned in the order of the court allowing intervention. The phrase also includes the fulfilling of only part of the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2), relating to the right of a person to institute a proceeding to quash. Thus, for instance, if a notified person notifies a person who has been summoned by sending a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail but does not mail a copy of that notice to the appropriate person and office under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B), the notified person has taken an action under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e).
