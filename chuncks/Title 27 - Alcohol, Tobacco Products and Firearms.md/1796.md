From the beginning point, proceed northeast along the 1,200-foot elevation contour, crossing over the Rocky Reach Dam map and onto the northwest corner of the Orondo map; then

(2) Continue northeasterly, then southwesterly along the 1,200-foot elevation contour, crossing back onto the Rocky Reach Dam map and continuing southwesterly along the 1,200-foot elevation contour to its intersection with the unnamed creek flowing from Spencer Lake; then

(3) Proceed northeasterly along the 1,200-foot elevation contour, crossing over the unnamed creek and continuing across the southeastern corner of the Ardenvoir map and onto the Entiat map; then

(4) Continue northeasterly then westerly along the 1,200-foot elevation contour, crossing back onto the Ardenvoir map, and continuing along the elevation contour to its intersection with the R20E/R21E boundary, which is concurrent with the western boundary of section 18, T25N/R21E; then

(5) Proceed north along the R20E/R21E boundary, crossing over the Entiat River and the Entiat Ditch, to the intersection of the range boundary and the 1,200-foot elevation contour; then

(6) Proceed easterly along the 1,200-foot elevation contour, crossing onto the Winesap map, and continuing northeasterly along the 1,200-foot elevation contour to its intersection with the boundary between sections 11 and 12, T26N/R21E; then

(7) Proceed north along the boundary between sections 11 and 12 for approximately 300 feet to its intersection with the 1,400-foot elevation contour; then

(8) Proceed northeast, then south, then easterly along the 1,400-foot elevation contour, crossing Knapp Coulee and onto the Chelan map, and continuing east along the 1,400-foot elevation contour to its intersection with the northern boundary of section 1, T26N/R22E; then

(9) Proceed south-southeasterly in a straight line, crossing the Columbia River, to the intersection of the 1,600-foot elevation contour and the R22E/R23E boundary; then

(10) Proceed generally westerly along the 1,600-foot elevation contour, crossing over the southeastern corner of the Winesap map and onto the Entiat map, and continuing southwesterly along the 1,600-foot elevation contour to its intersection with an unnamed stream in section 35, T26N/R21E; then

(11) Proceed westerly (downstream) along the unnamed stream for 0.45 mile to its intersection with the 1,200-foot elevation contour; then

(12) Proceed southerly along the 1,200-foot elevation contour, crossing over the Orondo map and onto the Wenatchee map to the intersection of the elevation contour with the southern boundary of section 14, T23N/R20E; then

(13) Proceed west-northwest in a straight line for 1.47 miles, crossing the Columbia River, to the beginning point.
