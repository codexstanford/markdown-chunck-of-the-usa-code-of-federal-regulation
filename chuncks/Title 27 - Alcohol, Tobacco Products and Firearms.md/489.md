###### ยง 5.122 Misleading statements or representations.
####### Ways in which statements or representations may be found to be misleading.

(b)(1) A statement or representation is prohibited, irrespective of falsity, if it directly creates a misleading impression, or if it does so indirectly through ambiguity, omission, inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific, or technical matter. For example, an otherwise truthful statement may be misleading because of the omission of material information, the disclosure of which is necessary to prevent the statement from being misleading.

(2) All claims, whether implicit or explicit, must have a reasonable basis in fact. Any claim on distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging that does not have a reasonable basis in fact, or cannot be adequately substantiated upon the request of the appropriate TTB officer, is considered misleading.
