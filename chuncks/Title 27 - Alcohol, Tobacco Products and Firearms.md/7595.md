######## Securities.

(a)Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid with respect to a security (as defined in § 70.143(d) of this part) against:

(1) A purchaser (as defined in § 70.143(f) of this part) of the security who at the time of purchase did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part) of the existence of the lien;

(2) A holder of a security interest (as defined in § 70.143(a) of this part) in the security who did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part) of the existence of the lien at the time the security interest came into existence or at the time such security interest was acquired from a previous holder for a consideration in money or money's worth (as defined in § 70.143(a) of this part); or

(3) A transferee of an interest protected under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section to the same extent the lien is invalid against the transferor to the transferee. For purposes of this paragraph, no person can improve that person's position with respect to the lien by reacquiring the interest from an intervening purchaser or holder of a security interest against whom the lien is invalid.
