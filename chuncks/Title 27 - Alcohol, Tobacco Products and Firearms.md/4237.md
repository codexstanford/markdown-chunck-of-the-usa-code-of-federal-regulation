####### Treatment by contact.

(a)Natural wine may be treated with any wood that is consistent with the food additive requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The wood may be in the form of barrels, staves, chips, particles, or storage tanks that were used for the addition of wine spirits if the tanks are used for the baking of wine. The wood may be toasted (that is, heated to low, medium, or high, temperature without undergoing combustion), or charred and the wood must not be otherwise treated. If wine is treated with charred wood, the wood may not remove color from the wine.
