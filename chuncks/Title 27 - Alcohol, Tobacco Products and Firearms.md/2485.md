The penal sum of the withdrawal bond must be equal to, or greater than, the total of the minimum amounts required for the individual plants. The bond must show the amount of coverage allocated to each individual plant as well as the total penal sum for all plants. If the portion of the penal sum allocated to a particular plant is less than the maximum amount prescribed in ยง 19.166 for a single plant, withdrawals from that plant must not exceed the amount of the penal sum allocated to that plant. The allocation of the penal sum notwithstanding, the entire penal sum of the bond must be available to satisfy all liability for tax on withdrawals from any and all of the covered plants.
