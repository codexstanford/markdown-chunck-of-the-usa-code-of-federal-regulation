###### ยง 24.230 Examination of tank car or tank truck.

Upon arrival of a tank car or tank truck at the bonded wine premises, the proprietor shall carefully examine the car or truck to see whether the seals are intact and whether there is any evidence of tampering or loss by leaking or otherwise. Any evidence of loss will be reported to the appropriate TTB officer. The contents of the tank car or tank truck will be gauged by weight or volume at the time of receipt by the proprietor. If the tank car or tank truck has been accurately calibrated and the calibration chart is available at the bonded wine premises, the spirits may be gauged by volume in the tank car or tank truck. In any case where a volume gauge is made, the actual measurements of the spirits in the gauging tank, tank car, or tank truck, and the temperature of the spirits will be recorded on the copy of the transfer record accompanying the shipment.
