####### Exclusion,Conditions and limitations.

(c)-(1)A charge for local advertising which is required by a manufacturer to be paid as a condition to his sale of an article is not a part of the taxable price of the article, to the extent that such charge meets each of the following conditions and limitations:

(i) Such charge does not exceed 5 percent of the difference between:

(A) An amount which would constitute the taxable price of the article (computed at the time of the sale of the article) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and

(B) The amount of any separate charge for local advertising, whatever the amount of such charge may be,

(ii) Such charge is specifically shown as a separate charge for local advertising on the invoice or statement covering the sale of the article.

(iii) Such charge is billed by the manufacturer with the intention on his part of repaying the amount of the charge to the person purchasing the article from him, or to any person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the fact of such intention will be assumed in all cases where the manufacturer and his vendees are parties to an advertising plan which calls for such repayments, or the manufacturer can otherwise establish that the vendees to whom he bills such charges understand and expect that such repayments will be made.
