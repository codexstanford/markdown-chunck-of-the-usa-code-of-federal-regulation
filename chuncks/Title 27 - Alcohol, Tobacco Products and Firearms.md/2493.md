(b)A strengthening bond is a second bond with the same surety as on the original bond which covers the increased liability. A strengthening bond must show both its execution date and its effective date. TTB will not accept a strengthening bond if it contains any term or condition that is a release, or could be interpreted as a release, from liability under any former bond, or that limits the liability of any bond to less than its full penal sum.
