######## Annual return period.

(ii)Subject to paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to use an annual return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $1,000 in taxes with respect to wine imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 and 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), the last day for paying the tax and filing the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar year. However, the taxpayer may not use the annual return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $1,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the quarterly or semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
