(2)(i)A proprietor may file a completed TTB F 5120.17 on a quarterly or annual basis if the proprietor meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (g)(2)(iii) of this section. To begin the quarterly or annual filing of a report of bonded wine premises operations, a proprietor must state the intent to do so in the "Remarks" section when filing the prior month's TTB F 5120.17. A proprietor who is commencing operations during a calendar year and expects to meet these criteria may use a letter notice to the appropriate TTB officer and file TTB F 5120.17 quarterly or annually for the remaining portion of the calendar year. If a proprietor becomes ineligible for quarterly or annual filing by exceeding the applicable tax liability or activity limit, the proprietor must file TTB F 5120.17 for that month and for all subsequent months of the calendar year. If there is jeopardy to the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may at any time require any proprietor otherwise eligible for quarterly or annual filing of a report of bonded wine premises operations to file such report monthly.
