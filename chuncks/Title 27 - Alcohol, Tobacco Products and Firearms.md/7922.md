####### Factors to be considered in determining whether a request or demand will be granted.

(i) The violation of a statute, such as 26 U.S.C. 6103 or 7213, or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule (F.R.Cr.P. Rule 6(e)), or a specific regulation;

(ii) The disclosure of classified information;

(iii) The disclosure of a confidential source or informant, unless the TTB officer or employee and the source or informant, have no objection;

(iv) The disclosure of investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes if enforcement proceedings would thereby be impeded, or of investigative techniques and procedures whose effectiveness would thereby be impaired, unless the appropriate TTB officer determines that the administration of justice requires disclosure;

(v) The disclosure of trade secrets without the owner's consent; or

(vi) Testimony in a case in which TTB has no interest, records or other official information.
