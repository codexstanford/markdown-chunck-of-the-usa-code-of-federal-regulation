### Subchapter A - Alcohol
#### PART 24 - WINE
##### Subpart P - Eligibility for the Hard Cider Tax Rate
###### ยง 24.332 Hard cider materials.
####### Fruit products.

(b)(1) Wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it contains any fruit product other than apple or pear. A fruit product is any material derived or made from any fruit or part of a fruit, including but not limited to, concentrates, extracts, juices, powders, or wine spirits.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง 24.332(b)(1), an authorized wine treating material set forth in ยง 24.246 that is derived from a fruit other than apple or pear may be used in the production of wine otherwise eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it is used for a purpose other than flavoring and it is either used in accordance with the wine treating materials provisions of ยง 24.246 (if used in a natural wine), or used in amounts insufficient to impart a fruit flavor other than apple or pear (if used in a special natural wine or other than standard wine). In determining whether the use of wine treating materials derived from a fruit other than apple or pear is for a purpose other than flavoring, TTB will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising of the product. Any written or pictorial reference to a material derived from a fruit other than apple or pear (other than the inclusion of a wine treating material in an ingredient labeling statement) in the labeling or advertising of a wine will be treated as evidence that the wine treating material was added for the purpose of flavoring the wine.
