####### Sale at retail.

(1)A "sale at retail," or a "retail sale", is a sale of an article to a purchaser who intends to use or lease the article rather than resell it. The fact that articles are sold in wholesale lots, or at wholesale prices, will not change the character of such sales as "sales at retail" if the purchaser is not engaged in the business of reselling such articles, and acquires them for the purpose of using them rather than reselling them.
