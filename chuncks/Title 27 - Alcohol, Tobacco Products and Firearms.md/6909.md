###### Use by Manufacturer or Importer Considered Sale
####### ยง 53.114 Use in further manufacture.

For purposes of section 4218 and ยง 53.111, an article is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article, if it is incorporated in, or is a part or accessory of, the other article. In addition, an article is considered to be used as material in the manufacturer of another article if it is partly or entirely consumed in testing such other article; for example, shells or cartridges used in testing new firearms. Similarly, if an article is partly or wholly consumed in quality testing a production run of like articles, such article is also considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of another article. However, if a taxable article that has been used tax free and only partly consumed in testing is later sold, or put to a taxable use by the manufacturer, tax attaches to such sale or use. An article that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not used as material in the manufacture or production of or as a component part of, such other article.
