The petition must set forth facts tending to show action of an arbitrary nature, or action without reasonable warrant in fact, or action contrary to law and regulations. A copy of the petition shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer or served on the respondent or applicant as the case may be. In the event of such appeal, the appropriate TTB officer shall immediately certify and forward the complete original record, by certified mail, to the Administrator, for his consideration and review.
