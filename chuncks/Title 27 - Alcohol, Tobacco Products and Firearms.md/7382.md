######## Subordination of lien,By payment of the amount subordinated.

(c)-(1)The appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under 26 U.S.C. 64 upon any part of the property subject to the lien if there is paid over to the appropriate TTB officer an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States. For this purpose, the tax lien may be subordinated to another lien or interest on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, if a notice of a Federal tax lien is filed and a delinquent taxpayer secures a mortgage loan on a part of the property subject to the tax lien and pays over the proceeds of the loan to the appropriate TTB officer after an application for a certificate of subordination is approved, the appropriate TTB officer will issue a certificate of subordination. This certificate will have the effect of subordinating the tax lien to the mortgage.
