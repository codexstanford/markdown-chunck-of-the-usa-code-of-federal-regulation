(2)A proprietor is required to provide a bond or bonds to cover operations and withdrawals of wine for industrial use even if the proprietor pays tax on a deferred basis under ยง 24.271 and is eligible to use an annual or quarterly return period under ยง 24.271(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii). In the case of a proprietor whose operations or withdrawals involve wine for both nonindustrial and industrial use, wine is considered to be for industrial use for purposes of this paragraph unless the proprietor designates the wine as solely for nonindustrial use upon production of the wine by fermentation or upon receiving the wine and, in either case, does not thereafter mix the wine with any wine for industrial use.
