####### Age statements and percentage of type statements for whisky.

(b)For all domestic or foreign whiskies that are aged less than 4 years, including blends containing a whisky that is aged less than 4 years, an age statement and percentage of types of whisky statement is required to appear on a label, unless the whisky is labeled as "bottled in bond" in conformity with ยง 5.88. For all other whiskies, the statements are optional, but if used, they must conform to the formatting requirements listed below. Moreover, if the bottler chooses to include a statement of age or percentage on the label of a product that is 4 years old or more and that contains neutral spirits, the statement must appear immediately adjacent to the neutral spirits statement required by ยง 5.70. The following are the allowable formats for the age and percentage statements for whisky:

(1)(i) In the case of whisky, whether or not mixed or blended but containing no neutral spirits, the age of the youngest whisky in the product. The age statement must appear substantially as follows: "____ years old"; and

(ii) If a whisky is aged in more than one container, the label may optionally indicate the types of oak containers used.

(2) In the case of whisky containing neutral spirits, whether or not mixed or blended, if any straight whisky or other whisky in the product is less than 4 years old, the percentage by volume of each such whisky and the age of each such whisky (the age of the youngest of the straight whiskies or other whiskies if the product contains two or more of either). The age and percentage statement for a straight whisky and other whisky must appear immediately adjacent to the neutral spirits statement required by ยง 5.70 and must read substantially as follows:

(i) If the product contains only one straight whisky and no other whisky: "____ percent straight whisky ____ years old;"

(ii) If the product contains more than one straight whisky but no other whisky: "____ percent straight whiskies ____ years or more old." In this case the age blank must state the age of the youngest straight whisky in the product. However, in lieu of the foregoing statement, the following statement may appear on the label: "____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, and ____ percent straight whisky ____ years old";

(iii) If the product contains only one straight whisky and one other whisky: "____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent whisky ____ years old"; or

(iv) If the product contains more than one straight whisky and more than one other whisky: "____ percent straight whiskies ____ years or more old, ____ percent whiskies ____ years or more old." In this case, the age blanks must state the age of the youngest straight whisky and the age of the youngest other whisky. However, in lieu of the foregoing statement, the following statement may appear on the label: "____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent whisky ____ years old, and ____ percent whisky ____ years old";

(3) In the case of an imported rye whisky, wheat whisky, malt whisky, or rye malt whisky, a label on the product must state each age and percentage in the manner and form that would be required if the whisky had been made in the United States;

(4) In the case of whisky made in the United States and stored in reused oak barrels, other than corn whisky and light whisky, in lieu of the words "____ years old" specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the period of storage in the reused oak barrels must appear on the label as follows: "stored ____ years in reused cooperage."
