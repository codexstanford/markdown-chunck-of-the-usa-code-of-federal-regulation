####### Determination of "lowest price".

(e)In addition to other considerations, in determining a "lowest price" for purposes of sections 4216(b) (1) and (3) of the Code and ยง 53.97, such price shall be determined:

(1) Without requiring that a given percentage of sales be made at that price (provided that the volume of sales made at that price is great enough to indicate that those sales have not been engaged in primarily to establish a lower tax base), and

(2) Without including any charge for a fixed amount that the purchaser has an unconditional right to recover on the basis of a contractual arrangement existing at the time of sale.
