####### Flavorings.

(c)Wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it contains any fruit flavoring other than apple or pear. For purposes of this section, a fruit flavoring other than apple or pear is any flavoring that imparts the flavor of a fruit other than apple or pear and includes a natural fruit flavor, an artificial fruit flavor, and a natural flavor that artificially imparts the flavor of a fruit that is not contained in that flavor. In determining whether the use of a flavoring imparts the flavor of a fruit other than apple or pear, TTB will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising of the product. Any written or pictorial reference to a fruit flavor other than apple or pear in the labeling or advertising of a wine that contains a flavoring will be treated as evidence that the wine contains a flavoring that imparts a fruit flavor other than apple or pear and thus the wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate. The use of spices, honey, hops, or pumpkins as a flavoring will not make a wine ineligible for the hard cider tax rate.
