####### ยง 70.231 Protection for certain interests even though notice filed.
######## Residential property subject to a mechanic's lien for certain repairs and improvements.

(g)Even though a notice of lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with ยง 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against a mechanic's lienor (as defined in ยง 70.143(b) of this part) who holds a lien for the repair or improvement of a personal residence if:

(1) The residence is occupied by the owner and contains no more than four dwelling units, and

(2) The contract price on the prime contract with the owner for the repair or improvement (excluding interest and expenses described in ยง 70.147 of this part) is not more than $1,000. For purposes of this paragraph, the amounts of subcontracts under the prime contract with the owner are not to be taken into consideration for purposes of computing the $1,000 prime contract price. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the contractor undertakes the work or that the contractor knew of the lien before undertaking the work.
