####### Identify added flavoring material(s) used before, during, and after fermentation.

(2)The statement of composition must disclose fermentable or non-fermentable flavoring materials added to the malt beverage base class.

(i) If the flavoring material is used before or during the fermentation process, the statement of composition must indicate that the malt beverage was fermented or brewed with the flavoring material (such as "Beer Fermented with grapefruit juice" or "Grapefruit Ale"). If the flavoring material is added after fermentation, the statement of composition must describe that process, using terms such as "added," "with," "infused," or "flavored" (such as "Grapefruit-flavored ale.").

(ii) If a single flavoring material is used in the production of the malt beverage product, the flavoring material may be specifically identified (such as "Ale Fermented with grapefruit juice") or generally referenced (such as "Ale with natural flavor"). If two or more flavoring materials are used in the production of the malt beverage, each flavoring material may be specifically identified (such as "lemon juice, kiwi juice" or "lemon and kiwi juice") or the characterizing flavoring material may be specifically identified and the remaining flavoring materials may be generally referenced (such as "kiwi and other natural and artificial flavor(s)"), or all flavors may be generally referenced (such as "with artificial flavors").
