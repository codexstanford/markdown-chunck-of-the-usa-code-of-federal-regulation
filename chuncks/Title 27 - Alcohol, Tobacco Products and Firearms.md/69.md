###### ยง 4.7 Products produced as wine that are not covered by this part.

Certain wine products do not fall within the definition of a "wine" under the FAA Act and are thus not subject to this part. They may, however, also be subject to other labeling requirements. See 27 CFR parts 24 and 27 for labeling requirements applicable to "wine" as defined by the IRC. See 27 CFR part 16 for health warning statement requirements applicable to "alcoholic beverages" as defined by the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act.
