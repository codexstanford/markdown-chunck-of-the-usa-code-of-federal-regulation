######## Failure to pay tax not shown on return.

(3)In case of failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which is not so shown (including an assessment made pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6213(b)) within 10 days from the date of the notice and demand therefor, there shall be added to the amount shown in the notice and demand the amount specified below unless the failure to pay the tax within the prescribed time is shown to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer to be due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The amount to be added to the tax is 0.5 percent of the amount stated in the notice and demand if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional 0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate. The maximum amount of the addition permitted under this subparagraph shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. The preceding sentence applies to amounts assessed on or before December 31, 1986.
