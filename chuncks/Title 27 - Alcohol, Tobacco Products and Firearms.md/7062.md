###### ยง 53.155 Extension of time for filing returns.
####### Application for extension of time.

(b)The application for an extension of time for filing the return shall be addressed to the appropriate TTB officer with whom the return is to be filed and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay. It should be made on or before the due date of the return, and failure to do so many indicate negligence and constitute sufficient cause for denial. It should, where possible, be made sufficiently early to permit consideration of the matter and reply before what otherwise would be the due date of the return.
