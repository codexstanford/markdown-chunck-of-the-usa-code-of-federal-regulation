####### § 25.58 New and superseding formulas.
######## Superseding formulas.

(b)You may file a superseding formula, instead of a new formula, if you have made any change listed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section and that change is not of a type that would require a holder of a certificate of label approval to file a new application for label approval on TTB Form 5100.31.

(1) A superseding formula replaces an existing formula, and you should file one only if you do not intend to use the existing formula any more. A superseding formula must be filed with TTB for approval. When TTB approves a superseding formula, TTB will cancel your previous formula.

(2) You may use the same formula number for a superseding formula that you used for the formula the superseding formula replaces, but you must annotate the formula number to indicate it is a superseding formula number. (For example, "Formula 2, superseding.")

(c) When you file a new or superseding formula with TTB, you must follow the procedures and other requirements of §§ 25.56 and 25.57.
