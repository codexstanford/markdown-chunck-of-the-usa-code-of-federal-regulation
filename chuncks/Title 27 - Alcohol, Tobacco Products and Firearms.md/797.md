####### Optional statements.

(d)The bottler may, but is not required to, be identified by a phrase describing the function performed by that person, such as "bottled by," "canned by," "packed by," or "filled by," followed by the name and address of the bottler. If one person performs more than one function, the label may so indicate (for example, "brewed and bottled by XYZ Brewery.") If different functions are performed by more than one person, statements on the label may not create the misleading impression that the different functions were performed by the same person. The appropriate TTB officer may require specific information about the functions performed if necessary to prevent a misleading impression on the label.
