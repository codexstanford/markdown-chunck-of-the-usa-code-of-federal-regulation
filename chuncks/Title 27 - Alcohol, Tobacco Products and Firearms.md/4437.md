(b)The amelioration record will show the basis for entries and calculations, including determination of the natural fixed acid level and total solids content of juice, as applicable. The records are maintained on the basis of annual accounting periods, with each period commencing on July 1 of a year and ending on the following June 30, except the record for an accounting period may be continued after June 30, where the juice or wine included therein is to be held after that date for completion. When the amelioration of wine included in the record for one accounting period is complete, the record is closed and any unused ameliorating material may not be used. The proprietor may mix wines before amelioration of the wine is completed; however, the proprietor shall additionally maintain records necessary to establish the quantity of unused authorized material to which the resultant mixture would be entitled so that appropriate TTB officers may readily ascertain compliance with amelioration limitations.
