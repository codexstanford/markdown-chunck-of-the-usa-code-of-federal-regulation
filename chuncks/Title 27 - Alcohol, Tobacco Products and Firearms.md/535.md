####### Extractions from distilled spirits.

(d)The removal of any constituents from a distilled spirits product to such an extent that the product no longer possesses the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to that class or type of distilled spirits will alter the class or type of the product, and the resulting product must be redesignated appropriately. In addition, in the case of straight whisky, the removal of more than 15 percent of the fixed acids, volatile acids, esters, soluble solids, or higher alcohols, or the removal of more than 25 percent of the soluble color, constitutes an alteration of the class or type of the product and requires a redesignation of the product.
