####### Tables referred to in subpart E of this part.

(b)Table 1 provides a method of correcting hydrometer indications at temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit to true proof. If distilled spirits contain dissolved solids, temperature correction of the hydrometer reading by the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true proof. Tables 2 and 3 show the gallonage of spirituous liquor according to weight and proof. Table 4 shows the gallons per pound at each one-tenth proof from 1 to 200 proof. Table 5 shows the weight per wine gallon and proof gallon at each proof. Table 6 shows the volumes of alcohol and water and the specific gravity (air and vacuum) of spirituous liquor at each proof. Table 7 provides a means of ascertaining the volume (at 60 degree Fahrenheit) of spirits at various temperatures ranging from 18 degrees through 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
