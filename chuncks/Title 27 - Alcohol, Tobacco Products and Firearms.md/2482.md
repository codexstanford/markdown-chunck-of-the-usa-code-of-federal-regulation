######## Requirement for a withdrawal bond.

(a)Except as provided in ยง 19.151(d), a person must provide TTB with a withdrawal bond for a distilled spirits plant if the person intends to withdraw spirits from the distilled spirits plant upon determination of the taxes due on the spirits but before payment of the tax. The withdrawal bond must guarantee payment of any taxes due on distilled spirits withdrawn from bonded premises up to the amount of the bond. Such bond will be in addition to the operations bond, and if the distilled spirits are withdrawn under the withdrawal bond, the operations bond will no longer cover liability for payment of the tax on the spirits withdrawn. For purposes of this section, a person includes a corporation, together with all of its controlled subsidiaries, and a controlled subsidiary has the same meaning as in ยง 19.163(b).
