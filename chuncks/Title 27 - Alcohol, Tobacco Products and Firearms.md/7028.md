###### ยง 53.136 Tax-free sales of articles to nonprofit educational organizations.
####### In general.

(a)An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(5) of the Code and this section, to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term "nonprofit educational organization". An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(D) of the Code, and paragraph (e) of ยง 53.178, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a nonprofit educational organization.
