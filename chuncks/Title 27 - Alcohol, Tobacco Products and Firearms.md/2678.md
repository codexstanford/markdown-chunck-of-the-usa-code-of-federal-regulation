######## Records of production gauge.

(d)For the production gauge, fractional proof gallons will be rounded to the nearest one-tenth and the average content and the number of packages filled will be used in computing the quantity produced. The actual proof gallons in each remnant container must be shown. As provided in ยง 19.618, a separate gauge record will be prepared for each lot of packages filled (see ยง 19.485) and for each removal by pipeline or bulk conveyance for deposit in bond on the same plant premises. The gauge record will show "Deposit in storage" or "Deposit in processing." If spirits are to be transferred in bond or withdrawn from bond, the production gauge will be made on the form or record required by this part (accompanied by a package gauge record, if required).
