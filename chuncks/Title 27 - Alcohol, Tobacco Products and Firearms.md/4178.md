######## Wine bond.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the proprietor must give bond on TTB F 5120.36, Wine Bond, to cover the liability for excise taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, on wines produced or received by the proprietor. The bond will apply to wine, spirits, and volatile fruit-flavor concentrate, or other commodities subject to tax under 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, in transit to or on bonded wine premises, and to the operations of the bonded wine premises, whether the transaction or operation on which the proprietor's liability is based occurred on or off the proprietor's premises. The bond will provide that the proprietor shall faithfully comply with all provisions of law and regulation relating to activities covered by the bond. This bond has a tax obligation limit of $500 for wine removed from bonded wine premises on which the tax has been determined, but not paid, unless the total penal sum of the operations bond is $2,000 or more and the proprietor and the surety designate $1,000 of this amount as the obligation limit for wine on which the tax has been determined, but not paid.
