(3)If the proprietor pays tax by EFT and has a gross tax liability of less than $5 million in distilled spirits taxes during a calendar year, combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, payment by EFT will be optional in the following year. The proprietor may continue to remit tax payment by EFT as provided in this section, or the proprietor may remit taxpayment using any acceptable method as set forth in ยง 19.239. If the proprietor decides to stop paying tax by EFT, the proprietor must give the appropriate TTB officer written notice of that decision. The proprietor must attach a written notice to the first return on form TTB F 5000.24 filed using a method of payment other than EFT. Such notice must state that tax is not due by EFT because the proprietor's tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than $5 million. The proprietor must further state that future tax payments will be filed with the returns on TTB F 5000.24.
