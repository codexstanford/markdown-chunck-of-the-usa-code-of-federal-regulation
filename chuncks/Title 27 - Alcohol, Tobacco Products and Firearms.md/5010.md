######## Quarterly return period.

(3)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to use a quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $50,000 in taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs.

(4) The following additional rules apply to the annual and quarterly return period procedures under this section:

(i) A "taxpayer" is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;

(ii) "Reasonably expects" means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit;

(iii) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the tax liability for all locations with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or beer tax liability to determine eligibility for the return procedures;

(iv) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or beer tax liability to determine eligibility for the return procedures;

(v) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the return procedures. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the return procedures, and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in distilled spirits, wine, or beer excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT must be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);

(vi) A new taxpayer is eligible to use the return procedures in the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 (in the case of the annual return procedure) or $50,000 (in the case of the quarterly return procedure) in distilled spirits, wine, or beer taxes during that calendar year; and

(vii) If a taxpayer becomes ineligible to use a return procedure described in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section because the taxpayer's liability exceeds $1,000 or $50,000, respectively, during a taxable year, that taxpayer may resume that return procedure only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $1,000 or $50,000 as the case may be. A taxpayer may not use an annual or quarterly return procedure during any calendar year in which the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for more than $1,000 (in the case of the annual return procedure) or $50,000 (in the case of the quarterly return procedure) in distilled spirits, wine, or beer taxes.
