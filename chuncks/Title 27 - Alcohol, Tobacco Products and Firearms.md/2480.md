######## Area operations bond covering multiple locations.

(a)A person who operates more than one distilled spirits plant within the geographical area serviced by the National Revenue Center may submit to TTB an area operations bond covering the operations of any two or more such plants and any bonded wine cellars that are adjacent to such plants and which otherwise could be covered by an operations bond. Area operations bonds filed under this section will be in lieu of the operations bond requirements for single distilled spirits plants under §§ 19.161 and 19.166 and must contain the same terms and conditions as those contained in separate bonds filed for single distilled spirits plants. Any person who files an area operations bond may not allocate or divide the penal sum of the area operations bond between the separate locations and the total penal sum of the bond must be available to satisfy liability incurred at any of the covered locations.
