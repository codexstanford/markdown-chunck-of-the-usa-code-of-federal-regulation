Losses by theft or any other cause of spirits while on bonded wine premises or in transit are to be determined and reported at the time the losses are discovered. A physical inventory of the spirits storage tanks will be taken at the close of any month during which spirits were used in wine production, or upon completion of spirits use for the month or at any other time required by the appropriate TTB officer. Any loss which has not previously been reported will be determined by the inventory.
