###### ยง 25.22 Continuity of brewery.

Brewery premises will be unbroken except that they may be separated by public passageways, streets, highways, waterways, carrier rights-of-way, or partitions. If the brewery premises are separated, the parts will abut on the dividing medium and be adjacent to each other. If the brewer has facilities for loading, or for case packing or storage which are located within reasonable proximity to the brewery, the appropriate TTB officer may approve these facilities as part of the brewery if the revenue will not be jeopardized.
