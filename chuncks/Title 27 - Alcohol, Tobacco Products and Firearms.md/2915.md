######## Packages of spirits and denatured spirits filled during processing operations.

(a)When a proprietor fills packages of spirits and denatured spirits during processing, the proprietor must identify the packages consecutively beginning with "1" and continuing the series until the number "1,000,000" is reached, except that any series of such numbers already in use may be continued to that limit. When the identification in any series reaches "1,000,000", the proprietor may begin a new series with "1" but must add an alphabetical prefix or suffix to the new series number. For example, the first identifier in the second series of 1,000,000 packages filled might be "1A" or "A1".
