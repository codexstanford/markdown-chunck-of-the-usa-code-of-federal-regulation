####### Half and half.

(b)No product may be designated with the type designation "half and half" unless it is in fact composed of equal parts of two classes of malt beverages, the names of which are conspicuously stated immediately adjacent to the designation "half and half" (for example, "Half and Half, Porter and Stout"). This does not preclude the use of terms such as "half and half" as part of a distinctive or fanciful name that refers to flavors added to a malt beverage designated in accordance with trade understanding or with a statement of composition.
