(2)A certification submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is valid as long as the wine is of the same brand and class or type, was made by the same producer, was subjected to the same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements made on the certification. Accordingly, if the cellar treatment of the wine changes and a new certification under ยง 27.140 is required, an importer is required to submit a new certification for the wine even though it is subject to the same label approval.
