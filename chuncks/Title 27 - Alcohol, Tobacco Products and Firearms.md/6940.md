####### In general.

(a)Section 4216(b)(2) of the Code provides a special rule under which a manufacturer shall determine a constructive sale price for this sale of taxable articles at retail, and to retail dealers, under certain conditions. The rule is applicable where:

(1) The manufacturer regularly sells such articles at retail, or to retailers, or both, as the case may be,

(2) The manufacturer also regularly sells such articles to one or more wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions, and the manufacturer establishes that its prices in such cases are determined without regard to any benefit to be derived under section 4216(b)(2) of the Code, and

(3) The transactions are arm's-length transactions.

(4) A manufacturer meeting the foregoing requirements shall base its tax liability for sales at retail and sales to retailers on the lower of its actual sale price or the highest price for which it sells the same articles under the same conditions to wholesale distributors.
