####### Determine.

To establish enough information about taxable products at the time of removal to calculate the tax, specifically the quantity (pounds or number) and kind (for example, cigarettes, snuff, paper tubes). Where the tax rate depends on additional information (such as number of cigarette papers to a set before January 1, 2000 or sale price of large cigars), that information must also be established as part of tax determination.
