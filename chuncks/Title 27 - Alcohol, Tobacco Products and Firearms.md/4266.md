(b)Other wine may be made on bonded wine premises but will remain segregated from standard wine. Other wine will have a basic character derived from the primary winemaking material. If sugar is used to make other wine, the aggregate weight of the sugar used before and during fermentation will be less than the weight of the primary wine producing material. Wine spirits may be added to other wine. Upon removal, other wine will be marked or labeled with a designation which will adequately disclose the nature and composition of the wine.
