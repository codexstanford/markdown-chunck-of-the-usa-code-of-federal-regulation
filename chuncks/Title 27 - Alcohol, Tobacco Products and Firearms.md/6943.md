####### Highest price to wholesale distributors.

(2)The "highest price" charged wholesale distributors for an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, is the highest price at which the manufacturer, producer, or importer sells the article to wholesale distributors, determined without regard to quantity. Such price shall be determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale with respect to the inclusions and exclusions under sections 4216(a) and (e) of the Code; however, since the price is to be a "highest" price, no further adjustment may be made for price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code.
