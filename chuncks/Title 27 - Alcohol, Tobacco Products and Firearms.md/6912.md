######## Articles governed by section 4218(a) used in manufacture of nontaxable combination articles.

(c)If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article to which section 4218(a) of the Code applies does not regularly sell such article separately but uses it as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a nontaxable combination article consisting of a taxable and nontaxable article, liability for tax on his use shall be computed on the constructive price of the taxable article at the time of use. To determine the constructive price of the taxable article in such case, the combination article is considered to be composed of:

(1) Parts used exclusively in the functioning of the taxable article in the combination;

(2) Parts used exclusively in the functioning of the nontaxable article in the combination, and

(3) Parts, called common parts, which serve a dual function in connection with the parts in both paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.
