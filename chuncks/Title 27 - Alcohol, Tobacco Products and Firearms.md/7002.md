###### ยง 53.133 Tax-free sale of articles for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export.
####### Sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export.

(b)In the case of sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, if the first or the second purchaser is located in a foreign country or possession of the United States, such purchaser is not required to register as provided in section 4222(a) of the Code and ยง 53.140. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain from such purchaser at the time title to the article passes or at the time of shipment, whichever is earlier, either:

(1) A written order or contract of sale showing that the manufacturer is to ship the article to a foreign destination; or

(2) Where delivery by the manufacturer is to be made within the United States, a statement from the purchaser showing:

(i) That the article is purchased either to fill existing or future orders for delivery to a foreign destination or for resale to another person engaged in the business of exporting who will export the article, and

(ii) That such article will be transported to its foreign destination in due course prior to use or further manufacture and prior to any resale except for export. See section 4221(b) of the Code and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for requirements as to timely proof of exportation and cessation of the exemption for export unless the evidence to show actual exportation has been received by the manufacturer.
