###### Limitations
####### ยง 70.231 Protection for certain interests even though notice filed.
######## Personal property subject to possessory liens.

(e)Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with ยง 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against a holder of a lien on tangible personal property which under local law secures the reasonable price of the repair or improvement of the property if the property is, and has been, continuously in the possession of the holder of the lien from the time the possessory lien arose. For example, if local law gives an automobile mechanic the right to retain possession of an automobile the mechanic has repaired as security for payment of the repair bill and the mechanic retains continuous possession of the automobile until such lien is satisfied, a tax lien filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C 6323(f)(1) which has attached to the automobile will not be valid to the extent of the reasonable price of the repairs. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the mechanic undertook the work or that the mechanic knew of the lien before undertaking the work.
