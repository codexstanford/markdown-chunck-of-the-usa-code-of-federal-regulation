(j)Any displaced nonprofit organization may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses in an amount of $2,500, if the Postal Service determines that it:

(1) Cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing patronage (membership or clientele). A nonprofit organization is assumed to meet this test, unless the Postal Service demonstrates otherwise; and

(2) Is not part of an enterprise having at least one other establishment engaged in the same or similar activity which is not being acquired by the Postal Service.
