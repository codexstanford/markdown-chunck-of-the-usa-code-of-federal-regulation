###### ยง 3010.323 Evidence - introduction and reliance upon studies and analyses.
####### Computer analyses.

(b)(1) In the case of computer studies or analyses which are being offered in evidence, or relied upon as support for other evidence, a foundation for the reception of such materials must be laid by furnishing a general description of the program that includes the objectives of the program, the processing tasks performed, the methods and procedures employed, and a listing of the input and output data and source codes (or a showing pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section as to why such codes cannot be so furnished) and such description shall be furnished in all cases. For the purpose of completing such foundation, the following additional items shall be deemed presumptively necessary and shall be furnished upon request of a party, the Commission, or the presiding officer, unless the presumption is overcome by an affirmative showing. The following information shall be provided:

(i) For all input data, designations of all sources of such data, and explanations of any modifications to such data made for use in the program;

(ii) Definitions of all input and output variables or sets of variables;

(iii) A description of input and output data file organization;

(iv) For all source codes, documentation sufficiently comprehensive and detailed to satisfy generally accepted software documentation standards appropriate to the type of program and its intended use in the proceeding;

(v) All pertinent operating system and programming language manuals;

(vi) If the requested program is user interactive, a representative sample run, together with any explanation necessary to illustrate the response sequence;

(vii) An expert on the design and operation of the program shall be provided at a technical conference to respond to any oral or written questions concerning information that is reasonably necessary to enable independent replication of the program output; and

(viii) Computer simulation models offered in evidence or relied upon as support for other evidence, shall be bound by all applicable provisions of this paragraph (b) and the separate requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, to the extent that portions of the simulation model utilize or rely upon such studies. Information that compares the simulation model output results to the actual phenomena being modelled, using data other than those from which the model was developed, shall be separately identified and submitted as evidence supporting the test and validation of the simulation model. Separate statements concerning the model limitations, including limiting model design assumptions and range of data input utilized in model design, shall be provided. Where test and validation of the entire simulation model are not possible, test and validation information shall be provided for disaggregate portions of the model. If disaggregate testing and validation are not possible, separate statements to that effect and statements regarding operational experts' review of model validity shall be provided.
