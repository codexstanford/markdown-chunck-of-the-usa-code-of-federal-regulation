####### Objections.

(c)In the interest of expedition, the grounds for every objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If an objection is made to part of an interrogatory, the part shall be specified. A party claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege asserted and state the reasons for its applicability. A party claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the effort that would be required to answer the interrogatory, providing estimates of cost and work hours required, to the extent possible. An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable because an answer would involve an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the Commission or presiding officer may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until a prehearing conference or other later time. Objections shall be filed with the Commission and served on the requesting party within ten days of the filing of the interrogatories. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless excused by the Commission or presiding officer for good cause shown.
