Where the authorizing official determines this information would otherwise be appropriate for release under this part, the Office of Inspector General may request an in camera review to determine the necessity for its release.

(ii) The specific limitations on the production of certain categories of information set forth in paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section do not require or imply that other documents or testimony will be authorized without limitation.

(5) When authorizing testimony or the release of documents, the authorizing official will establish the extent of the Office of Inspector General's response.

(ii) If the authorizing official allows the production of documents or testimony, arrangements shall be made for the taking of testimony or receipt of documents by the method least disruptive to the employee's official duties. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.

(iii) The Inspector General, authorizing official, or a delegee may designate an employee other than the employee identified in the request to respond to a request for an appearance.

(6) Upon the authorizing official's issuance of a final determination not to authorize testimony or release records, the party making the request may consult or negotiate with the authorizing official to refine and limit the demand.
