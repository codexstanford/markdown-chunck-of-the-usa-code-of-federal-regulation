####### Labeling.

(c)Material filed as a library reference shall be labeled in a manner consistent with standard Commission notation and any other conditions the Commission or presiding officer establishes. Each library reference shall be identified by a unique identification number. The standard format for an identification number shall be "[abbreviated name of person filing]-LR-[docket identification]-[optional: NP][sequential number by person filing]." For example, "PRC-LR-CP2010-1-NP8" read right to left would be the eighth (8) non-public (NP) item filed in Docket No. (CP2010-1) as a library reference (LR) by the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC). Alternative formats may be used when required for clear identification of the material being filed.
