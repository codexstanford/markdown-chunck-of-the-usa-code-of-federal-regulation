(ii) A complete description of the econometric model(s) and the reasons for each major assumption and specification;

(iii) The definition of the variables selected and the justification for their selection;

(iv) For any alternative model whose computed econometric results influenced the choice of the preferred model, a statement of the reasons for rejecting that alternative, an identification of any differences between that alternative and the preferred model with respect to variable definitions, equation forms, data, or estimation methods, and, upon request, the computed econometric results for that alternative;

(v) A reference to a detailed description in a text, manual, or technical journal for every econometric technique used in the estimation process and the reasons for selecting the technique, or, in the alternative, a description and analysis of the technique that is sufficient for a technical evaluation;

(vi) Summary descriptions and source citations for all input data and, upon request, a complete listing of the data. Complete descriptions of any alterations, adjustments, or transformations made to the data as received from the original sources, and the reasons for making the alterations, adjustments, or transformations;

(vii) A complete report of the econometric results including, where applicable coefficient estimates, standard errors and t-values, goodness-of-fit statistics, other appropriate test statistics, the variance/covariance matrix of the estimates, and computed residuals for results computed from samples composed of fewer than 250 observations, and, upon request, other computed residuals; and

(viii) Descriptions of all statistical tests of hypotheses and the results of such tests.
