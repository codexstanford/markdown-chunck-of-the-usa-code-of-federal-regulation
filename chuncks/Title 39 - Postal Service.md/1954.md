####### In general.

(a)A library reference is a special type of filing, which is accepted by the Commission for the convenience of the person filing material that is not conducive to typical text based filings. The filing of a document as a library reference is appropriate when interest in the material is limited, when the material constitutes a secondary source that provides background or support for a position or matter, or when references to, or identification of, the material filed as a library reference would be facilitated. Examples of materials that are appropriate for filing as library references include electronic spreadsheets, workpapers in support of primary documents, pre-existing materials, secondary sources such as books or materials that are not readily available elsewhere, or other foundational materials filed in support of a primary document. Whenever possible, library references are to be filed in electronic format. The Commission reserves the right to refuse acceptance of any library reference material in its docket room and its right to take other action to ensure all persons' ability to obtain access to the material.
