####### Special Rules for Mobile Homes.

(c)(1) In computing replacement housing payments for mobile home owners under paragraph (b) of this section, apply the terms of ยง 777.25 (i) and (j) as appropriate, to transactions involving moving the mobile home to a new site.

(2) The acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park may leave a remainder that is not adequate to continue the operation of the park. When the Postal Service determines that its acquisition of the real property has had this effect and that for this reason a mobile home occupant located on the remaining part of the property is required to move, such occupant shall be considered a displaced person under these regulations and shall be entitled to such benefits hereunder as the person would otherwise qualify.
