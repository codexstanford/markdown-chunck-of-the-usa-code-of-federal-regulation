####### Contributes materially.

(h)The term "contributes materially," as used in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section means that, during the 2 taxable years prior to the taxable year in which displacement occurs, or during such other period as the Postal Service determines to be more equitable, a business or farm operation:

(1) Had average annual gross receipts of at least $5,000; or

(2) Had average annual net earnings of at least $1,000; or

(3) Contributed at least 33percent of the owner's or operator's average annual gross income from all sources.

(4) If the application of the above criteria creates an inequity or hardship in any given case, the Postal Service may approve the use of other criteria as determined appropriate.
