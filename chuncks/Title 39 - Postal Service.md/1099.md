###### Alternatives and mitigation.

(5)This portion of the environmental impact statement is vitally important. Based on the analysis in the Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences section (see ยง 775.11(c)(6)), the environmental impacts and the alternatives are presented in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choosing alternatives. Those preparing the statement must:

(i) Explore and evaluate all reasonable alternatives, including the "no action" alternative, and briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives.

(ii) Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail, including the proposed action, so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.

(iii) Identify the preferred alternative or alternatives in the draft and final statements.

(iv) Describe appropriate mitigation measures not considered to be an integral part of the proposed action or alternatives. See ยง 775.9(a)(7).
