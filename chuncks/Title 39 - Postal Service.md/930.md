###### Financial responsibility for returned payments.

(g)The RC is required to reimburse the Postal Service upon request for any returned checks or ACH debits for postage payments. The RC must, upon first becoming aware of a returned check or ACH debit, immediately lock the customer's CMRS account to prevent a meter reset until the RC receives confirmation of payment for the returned item. If a penalty or fine is assessed against the Postal Service for returned checks or ACH debit payments from an RC's customer, the Postal Service may request reimbursement for such penalty or fine from the RC. The RC is required to remit the amount of the returned item to the Postal Service plus the reimbursement request, to the extent applicable, within ten (10) banking days. Invoices will be created monthly for returns and/or applicable penalties or fines incurred for the previous month. The 10 banking days will start once the invoice is mailed. The RC has discretion to decide whether to charge its customer for any such reimbursement costs (of penalties or fines) the RC pays to the Postal Service in connection with the customer's returned check or ACH debit.
