####### Fixed Payment in Lieu of Moving Expenses, Farm Operation.

(g)Any displaced farm operation may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses in an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. For a displaced person to qualify for this payment, the Postal Service must determine that the farm operation contributed materially to the income of the displaced person during the two taxable years prior to the displacement (see paragraph (h) of this section). In the case of acquisition of land which was part of a farm operation before the acquisition, the fixed payment shall be made only if the Postal Service determines that:

(1) The acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be displaced from the operation on the remaining land; or

(2) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm operation.
