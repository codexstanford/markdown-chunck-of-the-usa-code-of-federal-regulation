###### Responses to comments.

(e)(1) A final statement responds to comments on a draft statement in one or more of the following ways:

(i) Modification of alternatives, including the proposed action.

(ii) Development and evaluation of alternatives not previously given serious consideration.

(iii) Supplementation, improvement, or modification of analyses.

(iv) Correction of facts.

(v) Explanation of why a comment does not warrant a direct response, citing supporting sources, authorities, or reasons. Relevant circumstances which may trigger reappraisal or further response must be indicated.

(2) Substantive comments received on a draft statement must be attached to the final statement.

(3) If all of the changes are minor and are confined to responses described in paragraphs (e)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section, errata sheets may be written, and only the comments and errata sheets need be recirculated. In such a case, the draft statement with the comments, errata sheets, and a new cover, must be filed as the final statement.
