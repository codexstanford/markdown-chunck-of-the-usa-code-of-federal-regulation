####### Institutional testimony.

(h)(1) This paragraph (h) is applicable to testimony offered in evidence that is not sponsored by an individual witness. This typically occurs when discovery questions are answered by the institution, and not by an individual witness.

(2) When institutional responses are offered in evidence by any party, the responding party shall make available at the hearing an officer of the institution that has the authority to attest to the authenticity and truthfulness of the responses, and that has the knowledge to be subject to oral cross-examination in regard to the responses. Section 3010.321 applies as if the officer of the institution were an individual witness.
