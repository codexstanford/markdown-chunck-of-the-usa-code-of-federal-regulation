###### Financial responsibility for returned payments.

(d)The provider must reimburse the Postal Service upon request for any returned checks or ACH debits for postage payments. The provider must, upon first becoming aware of a returned check or ACH debit, immediately lock the customer account to prevent resetting the account until the provider receives confirmation of payment for the returned item. If a penalty or fine is assessed against the Postal Service for returned checks or ACH debit payments from a provider's customer, the Postal Service may request reimbursement for such penalty or fine from the provider. The provider is required to remit the amount of the returned item plus the amount of the reimbursement request, to the extent applicable, to the Postal Service within ten (10) banking days. Invoices will be created monthly for returns and/or applicable penalties or fines incurred for the previous month. The 10 banking days will start once the invoice is mailed. The provider has discretion to decide whether to charge its customer for any such reimbursement costs (of penalties or fines) the provider pays to the Postal Service in connection with the customer's returned check or ACH debit.
