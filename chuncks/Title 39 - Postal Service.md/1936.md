###### ยง 3010.107 Appeals from interlocutory rulings by presiding officers.
####### Action by the Commission.

(d)(1) The Commission may dismiss an appeal certified by the presiding officer if it determines that:

(i) The objection to the ruling should be deferred until the Commission's consideration of the entire proceeding; or

(ii) Interlocutory review is otherwise not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances.

(2) When the presiding officer declines to certify an appeal, the Commission will not permit an interlocutory appeal unless it determines:

(i) That the presiding officer should have certified the matter;

(ii) That extraordinary circumstances exist; and

(iii) That prompt Commission decision is necessary to prevent grave detriment to the public interest.

(3) If the Commission fails to issue an order permitting an interlocutory appeal within 15 days after the presiding officer certifies the appeal or a participant files an application for review, the appeal shall be deemed denied. If the Commission issues an order permitting an appeal, it may rule upon the merits of the appeal in that order or at a later time.
