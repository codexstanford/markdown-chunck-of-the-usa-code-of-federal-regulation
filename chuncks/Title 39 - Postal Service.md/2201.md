##### § 3020.116 Discovery - in general.
###### Informal discovery.

(b)The discovery procedures in this section and §§ 3020.117 through 3020.119 are not exclusive. Participants are encouraged to engage in informal discovery whenever possible to clarify exhibits and testimony. The results of these efforts may be introduced into the record by stipulation, or by other appropriate means. In the interest of reducing motion practice, participants also are expected to use informal means to clarify questions and to identify portions of discovery requests considered overbroad or burdensome.
