####### Supplemental answers.

(f)The individual or party who has answered interrogatories is under the duty to seasonably amend a prior answer if the individual or party obtains information upon the basis of which the individual or party knows that the answer was incorrect when made or is no longer true. Parties shall serve supplemental answers to update or to correct responses whenever necessary, up until the date the answer could have been accepted into evidence as written cross-examination. Parties filing supplemental answers shall indicate whether the answer merely supplements the previous answer to make it current or whether it is a complete replacement for the previous answer.
