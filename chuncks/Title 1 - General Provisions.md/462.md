###### Deviations from the submission schedule for Emergency Circumstances.

(f)(1) This paragraph (f) applies when the following three conditions exist: NCPC is the Lead Agency; Emergency Circumstances exist; and an Extraordinary Circumstance as set forth in ยง 601.11 is present that precludes use of a CATEX.

(2) When the three conditions described above exist, NCPC shall undertake one of the following actions:

(i) When Emergency Circumstances render it necessary to take an action that requires an EA, the Executive Director shall prepare a concise, focused EA consistent with CEQ guidance. At the earliest opportunity, the Commission shall grant approval for the EA.

(ii) Where Emergency Circumstances make it necessary for the Commission to take an action with significant environmental impact without observing the provisions of these regulations, NCPC shall consult with CEQ about alternative arrangements. NCPC will limit such arrangements to actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other actions remain subject to NEPA review.
