###### Acknowledgments of requests.

(a)On receipt of a request, if the agency cannot provide the requested information within two working days, then an acknowledgment letter or email message will be sent to the requester that will confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under ยง 304.3(d) and will provide a request tracking number for further reference. Requesters may use this tracking number to determine the status of their request-including the date of its receipt and the estimated date on which action on it will be completed-by calling the agency's FOIA Public Liaison at (202) 480-2080. In some cases, the agency may seek further information or clarification from the requester.
