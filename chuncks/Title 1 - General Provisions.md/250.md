(1) Records are protected from public view;

(2) The area in which records are kept is supervised during business hours in order to prevent unauthorized persons from having access to them;

(3) Records are inaccessible to unauthorized persons outside of business hours; and

(4) Records are not disclosed to unauthorized persons or under unauthorized circumstances in oral, written or any other form.
