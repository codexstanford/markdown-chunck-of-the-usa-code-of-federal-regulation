(d)When you make a FOIA request, it will be considered to be an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under ยง 304.9, up to $50.00, unless you specifically request a waiver of fees. The agency ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.
