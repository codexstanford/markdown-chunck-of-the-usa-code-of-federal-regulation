## Chapter III - Administrative Conference of the United States
### PART 304 - DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS OR INFORMATION
#### Subpart A - Procedures for Disclosure of Records Under the Freedom of Information Act
##### ยง 304.1 General provisions.

(a) This subpart contains the rules that the Administrative Conference of the United States ("ACUS" or "the agency") follows in processing requests for disclosure of records under the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA" or "the Act"), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and in meeting its responsibilities under the Act. Note that electronic records are treated as records for the purposes of the FOIA. These rules should be read together with the text of the FOIA itself and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines). They also may be read in conjunction with the agency's "Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide," which provides basic information about use of the Act in relation to the agency's records. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with the agency's Privacy Act regulations as well as under this subpart.

(b) The agency will withhold records or information only when it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption of the FOIA or when disclosure is prohibited by law. Where full disclosure is not possible, the agency will consider whether partial disclosure is possible and, if so, will take reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt information. These policies do not create any right enforceable in court.
